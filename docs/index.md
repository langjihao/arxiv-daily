|**2025-01-09**|**MedCoDi-M: A Multi-Prompt Foundation Model for Multimodal Medical Data Generation**|Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing medical practice, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and healthcare delivery. However, its adaptation in medical settings still faces significant challenges, related to data availability and privacy constraints. Synthetic data has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these issues, addressing data scarcity while preserving privacy. Recently, Latent Diffusion Models have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-quality synthetic data. Meanwhile, the integration of different modalities has gained interest, emphasizing the need of models capable of handle multimodal medical data. Existing approaches struggle to integrate complementary information and lack the ability to generate modalities simultaneously. To address this challenge, we present MedCoDi-M, a 6.77-billion-parameter model, designed for multimodal medical data generation, that, following Foundation Model paradigm, exploits contrastive learning and large quantity of data to build a shared latent space which capture the relationships between different data modalities. Further, we introduce the Multi-Prompt training technique, which significantly boosts MedCoDi-M's generation under different settings. We extensively validate MedCoDi-M: first we benchmark it against five competitors on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, a state-of-the-art dataset for Chest X-ray and radiological report generation. Secondly, we perform a Visual Turing Test with expert radiologists to assess the realism and clinical relevance of the generated data, ensuring alignment with real-world scenarios. Finally, we assess the utility of MedCoDi-M in addressing key challenges in the medical field, such as anonymization, data scarcity and imbalance learning. The results are promising, demonstrating the applicability of MedCoDi-M in medical contexts.

|**2025-01-07**|**Activating Associative Disease-Aware Vision Token Memory for LLM-Based X-ray Report Generation**|X-ray image based medical report generation achieves significant progress in recent years with the help of the large language model, however, these models have not fully exploited the effective information in visual image regions, resulting in reports that are linguistically sound but insufficient in describing key diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel associative memory-enhanced X-ray report generation model that effectively mimics the process of professional doctors writing medical reports. It considers both the mining of global and local visual information and associates historical report information to better complete the writing of the current report. Specifically, given an X-ray image, we first utilize a classification model along with its activation maps to accomplish the mining of visual regions highly associated with diseases and the learning of disease query tokens. Then, we employ a visual Hopfield network to establish memory associations for disease-related tokens, and a report Hopfield network to retrieve report memory information. This process facilitates the generation of high-quality reports based on a large language model and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including the IU X-ray, MIMIC-CXR, and Chexpert Plus.

|**2025-01-05**|**GIT-CXR: End-to-End Transformer for Chest X-Ray Report Generation**|Medical imaging is crucial for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating medical conditions. The medical reports of radiology images are the primary medium through which medical professionals attest their findings, but their writing is time consuming and requires specialized clinical expertise. The automated generation of radiography reports has thus the potential to improve and standardize patient care and significantly reduce clinicians workload. Through our work, we have designed and evaluated an end-to-end transformer-based method to generate accurate and factually complete radiology reports for X-ray images. Additionally, we are the first to introduce curriculum learning for end-to-end transformers in medical imaging and demonstrate its impact in obtaining improved performance. The experiments have been conducted using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG database, the largest available chest X-ray dataset. The results obtained are comparable with the current state-of-the-art on the natural language generation (NLG) metrics BLEU and ROUGE-L, while setting new state-of-the-art results on F1 examples-averaged, F1-macro and F1-micro metrics for clinical accuracy and on the METEOR metric widely used for NLG.|Iustin Sîrbu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02598)|null|
|**2024-12-31**|**CRRG-CLIP: Automatic Generation of Chest Radiology Reports and Classification of Chest Radiographs**|The complexity of stacked imaging and the massive number of radiographs make writing radiology reports complex and inefficient. Even highly experienced radiologists struggle to maintain accuracy and consistency in interpreting radiographs under prolonged high-intensity work. To address these issues, this work proposes the CRRG-CLIP Model (Chest Radiology Report Generation and Radiograph Classification Model), an end-to-end model for automated report generation and radiograph classification. The model consists of two modules: the radiology report generation module and the radiograph classification module. The generation module uses Faster R-CNN to identify anatomical regions in radiographs, a binary classifier to select key regions, and GPT-2 to generate semantically coherent reports. The classification module uses the unsupervised Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, addressing the challenges of high-cost labelled datasets and insufficient features. The results show that the generation module performs comparably to high-performance baseline models on BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and outperformed the GPT-4o model on BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4, and ROUGE-L metrics. The classification module significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art model in AUC and Accuracy. This demonstrates that the proposed model achieves high accuracy, readability, and fluency in report generation, while multimodal contrastive training with unlabelled radiograph-report pairs enhances classification performance.|Jianfei Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01989)|null|
|**2025-01-10**|**MoColl: Agent-Based Specific and General Model Collaboration for Image Captioning**|Image captioning is a critical task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications across various domains. For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we call MoColl, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond its role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to enhance its domain-specific capabilities. Experimental results on radiology report generation validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of generated reports.|Pu Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01834)|null|
|**2024-12-24**|**Text-Driven Tumor Synthesis**|Tumor synthesis can generate examples that AI often misses or over-detects, improving AI performance by training on these challenging cases. However, existing synthesis methods, which are typically unconditional -- generating images from random variables -- or conditioned only by tumor shapes, lack controllability over specific tumor characteristics such as texture, heterogeneity, boundaries, and pathology type. As a result, the generated tumors may be overly similar or duplicates of existing training data, failing to effectively address AI's weaknesses. We propose a new text-driven tumor synthesis approach, termed TextoMorph, that provides textual control over tumor characteristics. This is particularly beneficial for examples that confuse the AI the most, such as early tumor detection (increasing Sensitivity by +8.5%), tumor segmentation for precise radiotherapy (increasing DSC by +6.3%), and classification between benign and malignant tumors (improving Sensitivity by +8.2%). By incorporating text mined from radiology reports into the synthesis process, we increase the variability and controllability of the synthetic tumors to target AI's failure cases more precisely. Moreover, TextoMorph uses contrastive learning across different texts and CT scans, significantly reducing dependence on scarce image-report pairs (only 141 pairs used in this study) by leveraging a large corpus of 34,035 radiology reports. Finally, we have developed rigorous tests to evaluate synthetic tumors, including Text-Driven Visual Turing Test and Radiomics Pattern Analysis, showing that our synthetic tumors is realistic and diverse in texture, heterogeneity, boundaries, and pathology.|Xinran Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18589)|null|
|**2024-12-20**|**Towards Interpretable Radiology Report Generation via Concept Bottlenecks using a Multi-Agentic RAG**|Deep learning has advanced medical image classification, but interpretability challenges hinder its clinical adoption. This study enhances interpretability in Chest X-ray (CXR) classification by using concept bottleneck models (CBMs) and a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for report generation. By modeling relationships between visual features and clinical concepts, we create interpretable concept vectors that guide a multi-agent RAG system to generate radiology reports, enhancing clinical relevance, explainability, and transparency. Evaluation of the generated reports using an LLM-as-a-judge confirmed the interpretability and clinical utility of our model's outputs. On the COVID-QU dataset, our model achieved 81% classification accuracy and demonstrated robust report generation performance, with five key metrics ranging between 84% and 90%. This interpretable multi-agent framework bridges the gap between high-performance AI and the explainability required for reliable AI-driven CXR analysis in clinical settings.|Hasan Md Tusfiqur Alam et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16086)|**[link](https://github.com/tifat58/irr-with-cbm-rag)**|
|**2024-12-20**|**Development of a Large-scale Dataset of Chest Computed Tomography Reports in Japanese and a High-performance Finding Classification Model**|Background: Recent advances in large language models highlight the need for high-quality multilingual medical datasets. While Japan leads globally in CT scanner deployment and utilization, the lack of large-scale Japanese radiology datasets has hindered the development of specialized language models for medical imaging analysis. Objective: To develop a comprehensive Japanese CT report dataset through machine translation and establish a specialized language model for structured finding classification. Additionally, to create a rigorously validated evaluation dataset through expert radiologist review. Methods: We translated the CT-RATE dataset (24,283 CT reports from 21,304 patients) into Japanese using GPT-4o mini. The training dataset consisted of 22,778 machine-translated reports, while the validation dataset included 150 radiologist-revised reports. We developed CT-BERT-JPN based on "tohoku-nlp/bert-base-japanese-v3" architecture for extracting 18 structured findings from Japanese radiology reports. Results: Translation metrics showed strong performance with BLEU scores of 0.731 and 0.690, and ROUGE scores ranging from 0.770 to 0.876 for Findings and from 0.748 to 0.857 for Impression sections. CT-BERT-JPN demonstrated superior performance compared to GPT-4o in 11 out of 18 conditions, including lymphadenopathy (+14.2%), interlobular septal thickening (+10.9%), and atelectasis (+7.4%). The model maintained F1 scores exceeding 0.95 in 14 out of 18 conditions and achieved perfect scores in four conditions. Conclusions: Our study establishes a robust Japanese CT report dataset and demonstrates the effectiveness of a specialized language model for structured finding classification. The hybrid approach of machine translation and expert validation enables the creation of large-scale medical datasets while maintaining high quality.|Yosuke Yamagishi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15907)|null|
|**2024-12-30**|**ReXTrust: A Model for Fine-Grained Hallucination Detection in AI-Generated Radiology Reports**|The increasing adoption of AI-generated radiology reports necessitates robust methods for detecting hallucinations--false or unfounded statements that could impact patient care. We present ReXTrust, a novel framework for fine-grained hallucination detection in AI-generated radiology reports. Our approach leverages sequences of hidden states from large vision-language models to produce finding-level hallucination risk scores. We evaluate ReXTrust on a subset of the MIMIC-CXR dataset and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing approaches, achieving an AUROC of 0.8751 across all findings and 0.8963 on clinically significant findings. Our results show that white-box approaches leveraging model hidden states can provide reliable hallucination detection for medical AI systems, potentially improving the safety and reliability of automated radiology reporting.|Romain Hardy et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15264)|null|
|**2024-12-23**|**DAMPER: A Dual-Stage Medical Report Generation Framework with Coarse-Grained MeSH Alignment and Fine-Grained Hypergraph Matching**|Medical report generation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and patient management, summarizing diagnoses and recommendations based on medical imaging. However, existing work often overlook the clinical pipeline involved in report writing, where physicians typically conduct an initial quick review followed by a detailed examination. Moreover, current alignment methods may lead to misaligned relationships. To address these issues, we propose DAMPER, a dual-stage framework for medical report generation that mimics the clinical pipeline of report writing in two stages. In the first stage, a MeSH-Guided Coarse-Grained Alignment (MCG) stage that aligns chest X-ray (CXR) image features with medical subject headings (MeSH) features to generate a rough keyphrase representation of the overall impression. In the second stage, a Hypergraph-Enhanced Fine-Grained Alignment (HFG) stage that constructs hypergraphs for image patches and report annotations, modeling high-order relationships within each modality and performing hypergraph matching to capture semantic correlations between image regions and textual phrases. Finally,the coarse-grained visual features, generated MeSH representations, and visual hypergraph features are fed into a report decoder to produce the final medical report. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DAMPER in generating comprehensive and accurate medical reports, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation metrics.|Xiaofei Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14535)|null|
|**2024-12-18**|**A Systematic Analysis of Input Modalities for Fracture Classification of the Paediatric Wrist**|Fractures, particularly in the distal forearm, are among the most common injuries in children and adolescents, with approximately 800 000 cases treated annually in Germany. The AO/OTA system provides a structured fracture type classification, which serves as the foundation for treatment decisions. Although accurately classifying fractures can be challenging, current deep learning models have demonstrated performance comparable to that of experienced radiologists. While most existing approaches rely solely on radiographs, the potential impact of incorporating other additional modalities, such as automatic bone segmentation, fracture location, and radiology reports, remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically analyse the contribution of these three additional information types, finding that combining them with radiographs increases the AUROC from 91.71 to 93.25. Our code is available on GitHub.|Ron Keuth et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13856)|**[link](https://github.com/multimodallearning/ao_classification)**|
|**2024-12-18**|**Read Like a Radiologist: Efficient Vision-Language Model for 3D Medical Imaging Interpretation**|Recent medical vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in 2D medical image interpretation. However extending them to 3D medical imaging has been challenging due to computational complexities and data scarcity. Although a few recent VLMs specified for 3D medical imaging have emerged, all are limited to learning volumetric representation of a 3D medical image as a set of sub-volumetric features. Such process introduces overly correlated representations along the z-axis that neglect slice-specific clinical details, particularly for 3D medical images where adjacent slices have low redundancy. To address this limitation, we introduce MS-VLM that mimic radiologists' workflow in 3D medical image interpretation. Specifically, radiologists analyze 3D medical images by examining individual slices sequentially and synthesizing information across slices and views. Likewise, MS-VLM leverages self-supervised 2D transformer encoders to learn a volumetric representation that capture inter-slice dependencies from a sequence of slice-specific features. Unbound by sub-volumetric patchification, MS-VLM is capable of obtaining useful volumetric representations from 3D medical images with any slice length and from multiple images acquired from different planes and phases. We evaluate MS-VLM on publicly available chest CT dataset CT-RATE and in-house rectal MRI dataset. In both scenarios, MS-VLM surpasses existing methods in radiology report generation, producing more coherent and clinically relevant reports. These findings highlight the potential of MS-VLM to advance 3D medical image interpretation and improve the robustness of medical VLMs.|Changsun Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13558)|null|
|**2024-12-16**|**The Impact of AI Assistance on Radiology Reporting: A Pilot Study Using Simulated AI Draft Reports**|Radiologists face increasing workload pressures amid growing imaging volumes, creating risks of burnout and delayed reporting times. While artificial intelligence (AI) based automated radiology report generation shows promise for reporting workflow optimization, evidence of its real-world impact on clinical accuracy and efficiency remains limited. This study evaluated the effect of draft reports on radiology reporting workflows by conducting a three reader multi-case study comparing standard versus AI-assisted reporting workflows. In both workflows, radiologists reviewed the cases and modified either a standard template (standard workflow) or an AI-generated draft report (AI-assisted workflow) to create the final report. For controlled evaluation, we used GPT-4 to generate simulated AI drafts and deliberately introduced 1-3 errors in half the cases to mimic real AI system performance. The AI-assisted workflow significantly reduced average reporting time from 573 to 435 seconds (p=0.003), without a statistically significant difference in clinically significant errors between workflows. These findings suggest that AI-generated drafts can meaningfully accelerate radiology reporting while maintaining diagnostic accuracy, offering a practical solution to address mounting workload challenges in clinical practice.|Julián N.

|**2024-12-16**|**LLM-RG4: Flexible and Factual Radiology Report Generation across Diverse Input Contexts**|Drafting radiology reports is a complex task requiring flexibility, where radiologists tail content to available information and particular clinical demands. However, most current radiology report generation (RRG) models are constrained to a fixed task paradigm, such as predicting the full ``finding'' section from a single image, inherently involving a mismatch between inputs and outputs. The trained models lack the flexibility for diverse inputs and could generate harmful, input-agnostic hallucinations. To bridge the gap between current RRG models and the clinical demands in practice, we first develop a data generation pipeline to create a new MIMIC-RG4 dataset, which considers four common radiology report drafting scenarios and has perfectly corresponded input and output. Secondly, we propose a novel large language model (LLM) based RRG framework, namely LLM-RG4, which utilizes LLM's flexible instruction-following capabilities and extensive general knowledge. We further develop an adaptive token fusion module that offers flexibility to handle diverse scenarios with different input combinations, while minimizing the additional computational burden associated with increased input volumes. Besides, we propose a token-level loss weighting strategy to direct the model's attention towards positive and uncertain descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-RG4 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both clinical efficiency and natural language generation on the MIMIC-RG4 and MIMIC-CXR datasets. We quantitatively demonstrate that our model has minimal input-agnostic hallucinations, whereas current open-source models commonly suffer from this problem.|Zhuhao Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12001)|**[link](https://github.com/zh-wang-med/llm-rg4)**|
|**2024-12-15**|**HC-LLM: Historical-Constrained Large Language Models for Radiology Report Generation**|Radiology report generation (RRG) models typically focus on individual exams, often overlooking the integration of historical visual or textual data, which is crucial for patient follow-ups. Traditional methods usually struggle with long sequence dependencies when incorporating historical information, but large language models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, making them well-suited for analyzing longitudinal medical data. In light of this, we propose a novel Historical-Constrained Large Language Models (HC-LLM) framework for RRG, empowering LLMs with longitudinal report generation capabilities by constraining the consistency and differences between longitudinal images and their corresponding reports. Specifically, our approach extracts both time-shared and time-specific features from longitudinal chest X-rays and diagnostic reports to capture disease progression. Then, we ensure consistent representation by applying intra-modality similarity constraints and aligning various features across modalities with multimodal contrastive and structural constraints. These combined constraints effectively guide the LLMs in generating diagnostic reports that accurately reflect the progression of the disease, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Longitudinal-MIMIC dataset. Notably, our approach performs well even without historical data during testing and can be easily adapted to other multimodal large models, enhancing its versatility.|Tengfei Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11070)|**[link](https://github.com/tengfeiliu966/hc-llm)**|
|**2024-12-13**|**Radiology Report Generation via Multi-objective Preference Optimization**|Automatic Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is an important topic for alleviating the substantial workload of radiologists. Existing RRG approaches rely on supervised regression based on different architectures or additional knowledge injection,while the generated report may not align optimally with radiologists' preferences. Especially, since the preferences of radiologists are inherently heterogeneous and multidimensional, e.g., some may prioritize report fluency, while others emphasize clinical accuracy. To address this problem,we propose a new RRG method via Multi-objective Preference Optimization (MPO) to align the pre-trained RRG model with multiple human preferences, which can be formulated by multi-dimensional reward functions and optimized by multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use a preference vector to represent the weight of preferences and use it as a condition for the RRG model. Then, a linearly weighed reward is obtained via a dot product between the preference vector and multi-dimensional reward. Next,the RRG model is optimized to align with the preference vector by optimizing such a reward via RL. In the training stage,we randomly sample diverse preference vectors from the preference space and align the model by optimizing the weighted multi-objective rewards, which leads to an optimal policy on the entire preference space. When inference,our model can generate reports aligned with specific preferences without further fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the proposed method can generate reports that cater to different preferences in a single model and achieve state-of-the-art performance.|Ting Xiao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08901)|null|
|**2024-12-10**|**Integrating MedCLIP and Cross-Modal Fusion for Automatic Radiology Report Generation**|Automating radiology report generation can significantly reduce the workload of radiologists and enhance the accuracy, consistency, and efficiency of clinical documentation.We propose a novel cross-modal framework that uses MedCLIP as both a vision extractor and a retrieval mechanism to improve the process of medical report generation.By extracting retrieved report features and image features through an attention-based extract module, and integrating them with a fusion module, our method improves the coherence and clinical relevance of generated reports.Experimental results on the widely used IU-Xray dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing improvements over commonly used methods in both report quality and relevance.Additionally, ablation studies provide further validation of the framework, highlighting the importance of accurate report retrieval and feature integration in generating comprehensive medical reports.|Qianhao Han et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07141)|**[link](https://github.com/QianhaoHan/Cross-Modality-Medical-Report-Generation)**|
|**2024-12-06**|**Enhancing LLMs for Impression Generation in Radiology Reports through a Multi-Agent System**|This study introduces "RadCouncil," a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to enhance the generation of impressions in radiology reports from the finding section. RadCouncil comprises three specialized agents: 1) a "Retrieval" Agent that identifies and retrieves similar reports from a vector database, 2) a "Radiologist" Agent that generates impressions based on the finding section of the given report plus the exemplar reports retrieved by the Retrieval Agent, and 3) a "Reviewer" Agent that evaluates the generated impressions and provides feedback. The performance of RadCouncil was evaluated using both quantitative metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) and qualitative criteria assessed by GPT-4, using chest X-ray as a case study. Experiment results show improvements in RadCouncil over the single-agent approach across multiple dimensions, including diagnostic accuracy, stylistic concordance, and clarity. This study highlights the potential of utilizing multiple interacting LLM agents, each with a dedicated task, to enhance performance in specialized medical tasks and the development of more robust and adaptable healthcare AI solutions.|Fang Zeng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06828)|null|
|**2024-12-08**|**MG-3D: Multi-Grained Knowledge-Enhanced 3D Medical Vision-Language Pre-training**|3D medical image analysis is pivotal in numerous clinical applications. However, the scarcity of labeled data and limited generalization capabilities hinder the advancement of AI-empowered models. Radiology reports are easily accessible and can serve as weakly-supervised signals. However, large-scale vision-language pre-training (VLP) remains underexplored in 3D medical image analysis. Specifically, the insufficient investigation into multi-grained radiology semantics and their correlations across patients leads to underutilization of large-scale volume-report data.   Considering intra-patient cross-modal semantic consistency and inter-patient semantic correlations, we propose a multi-task VLP method, MG-3D, pre-trained on large-scale data (47.1K), addressing the challenges by the following two aspects: 1) Establishing the correspondence between volume semantics and multi-grained medical knowledge of each patient with cross-modal global alignment and complementary modality-guided local reconstruction, ensuring intra-patient features of different modalities cohesively represent the same semantic content; 2) Correlating inter-patient visual semantics based on fine-grained report correlations across patients, and keeping sensitivity to global individual differences via contrastive learning, enhancing the discriminative feature representation. Furthermore, we delve into the scaling law to explore potential performance improvements. Comprehensive evaluations across nine uni- and cross-modal clinical tasks are carried out to assess model efficacy. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets demonstrate the superior transferability, scalability, and generalization of MG-3D, showcasing its potential in advancing feature representation for 3D medical image analysis.

|**2024-12-06**|**Gla-AI4BioMed at RRG24: Visual Instruction-tuned Adaptation for Radiology Report Generation**|We introduce a radiology-focused visual language model designed to generate radiology reports from chest X-rays. Building on previous findings that large language models (LLMs) can acquire multimodal capabilities when aligned with pretrained vision encoders, we demonstrate similar potential with chest X-ray images. This integration enhances the ability of model to understand and describe chest X-ray images. Our model combines an image encoder with a fine-tuned LLM based on the Vicuna-7B architecture, enabling it to generate different sections of a radiology report with notable accuracy. The training process involves a two-stage approach: (i) initial alignment of chest X-ray features with the LLM (ii) followed by fine-tuning for radiology report generation.|Xi Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04954)|**[link](https://github.com/Glasgow-AI4BioMed/RRG-BioNLP-ACL2024)**|
|**2024-12-05**|**Semantic Consistency-Based Uncertainty Quantification for Factuality in Radiology Report Generation**|Radiology report generation (RRG) has shown great potential in assisting radiologists by automating the labor-intensive task of report writing. While recent advancements have improved the quality and coherence of generated reports, ensuring their factual correctness remains a critical challenge. Although generative medical Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have been proposed to address this issue, these models are prone to hallucinations and can produce inaccurate diagnostic information. To address these concerns, we introduce a novel Semantic Consistency-Based Uncertainty Quantification framework that provides both report-level and sentence-level uncertainties. Unlike existing approaches, our method does not require modifications to the underlying model or access to its inner state, such as output token logits, thus serving as a plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method in detecting hallucinations and enhancing the factual accuracy of automatically generated radiology reports. By abstaining from high-uncertainty reports, our approach improves factuality scores by $10$%, achieved by rejecting $20$% of reports using the Radialog model on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. Furthermore, sentence-level uncertainty flags the lowest-precision sentence in each report with an $82.9$ % success rate.|Chenyu Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04606)|null|
|**2024-12-05**|**Automated Medical Report Generation for ECG Data: Bridging Medical Text and Signal Processing with Deep Learning**|Recent advances in deep learning and natural language generation have significantly improved image captioning, enabling automated, human-like descriptions for visual content. In this work, we apply these captioning techniques to generate clinician-like interpretations of ECG data. This study leverages existing ECG datasets accompanied by free-text reports authored by healthcare professionals (HCPs) as training data. These reports, while often inconsistent, provide a valuable foundation for automated learning. We introduce an encoder-decoder-based method that uses these reports to train models to generate detailed descriptions of ECG episodes. This represents a significant advancement in ECG analysis automation, with potential applications in zero-shot classification and automated clinical decision support.   The model is tested on various datasets, including both 1- and 12-lead ECGs. It significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art reference model by Qiu et al., achieving a METEOR score of 55.53% compared to 24.51% achieved by the reference model. Furthermore, several key design choices are discussed, providing a comprehensive overview of current challenges and innovations in this domain.

|**2024-12-04**|**MedAutoCorrect: Image-Conditioned Autocorrection in Medical Reporting**|In medical reporting, the accuracy of radiological reports, whether generated by humans or machine learning algorithms, is critical. We tackle a new task in this paper: image-conditioned autocorrection of inaccuracies within these reports. Using the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we first intentionally introduce a diverse range of errors into reports. Subsequently, we propose a two-stage framework capable of pinpointing these errors and then making corrections, simulating an \textit{autocorrection} process. This method aims to address the shortcomings of existing automated medical reporting systems, like factual errors and incorrect conclusions, enhancing report reliability in vital healthcare applications. Importantly, our approach could serve as a guardrail, ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of automated report generation. Experiments on established datasets and state of the art report generation models validate this method's potential in correcting medical reporting errors.|Arnold Caleb Asiimwe et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02971)|null|
|**2024-12-03**|**Anatomically-Grounded Fact Checking of Automated Chest X-ray Reports**|With the emergence of large-scale vision-language models, realistic radiology reports may be generated using only medical images as input guided by simple prompts. However, their practical utility has been limited due to the factual errors in their description of findings. In this paper, we propose a novel model for explainable fact-checking that identifies errors in findings and their locations indicated through the reports. Specifically, we analyze the types of errors made by automated reporting methods and derive a new synthetic dataset of images paired with real and fake descriptions of findings and their locations from a ground truth dataset. A new multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this datsaset. We evaluate the resulting fact-checking model and its utility in correcting reports generated by several SOTA automated reporting tools on a variety of benchmark datasets with results pointing to over 40\% improvement in report quality through such error detection and correction.|R.

|**2024-12-07**|**Evaluating Automated Radiology Report Quality through Fine-Grained Phrasal Grounding of Clinical Findings**|Several evaluation metrics have been developed recently to automatically assess the quality of generative AI reports for chest radiographs based only on textual information using lexical, semantic, or clinical named entity recognition methods. In this paper, we develop a new method of report quality evaluation by first extracting fine-grained finding patterns capturing the location, laterality, and severity of a large number of clinical findings. We then performed phrasal grounding to localize their associated anatomical regions on chest radiograph images. The textual and visual measures are then combined to rate the quality of the generated reports. We present results that compare this evaluation metric with other textual metrics on a gold standard dataset derived from the MIMIC collection and show its robustness and sensitivity to factual errors.|Razi Mahmood et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01031)|null|
|**2024-11-28**|**Libra: Leveraging Temporal Images for Biomedical Radiology Analysis**|Radiology report generation (RRG) is a challenging task, as it requires a thorough understanding of medical images, integration of multiple temporal inputs, and accurate report generation. Effective interpretation of medical images, such as chest X-rays (CXRs), demands sophisticated visual-language reasoning to map visual findings to structured reports. Recent studies have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can acquire multimodal capabilities by aligning with pre-trained vision encoders. However, current approaches predominantly focus on single-image analysis or utilise rule-based symbolic processing to handle multiple images, thereby overlooking the essential temporal information derived from comparing current images with prior ones. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce Libra, a temporal-aware MLLM tailored for CXR report generation using temporal images. Libra integrates a radiology-specific image encoder with a MLLM and utilises a novel Temporal Alignment Connector to capture and synthesise temporal information of images across different time points with unprecedented precision. Extensive experiments show that Libra achieves new state-of-the-art performance among the same parameter scale MLLMs for RRG tasks on the MIMIC-CXR. Specifically, Libra improves the RadCliQ metric by 12.9% and makes substantial gains across all lexical metrics compared to previous models.|Xi Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19378)|**[link](https://github.com/X-iZhang/Libra)**|

We introduce FactCheXcker, a modular framework that de-hallucinates radiology report measurements by leveraging an improved query-code-update paradigm. Specifically, FactCheXcker employs specialized modules and the code generation capabilities of large language models to solve measurement queries generated based on the original report. After extracting measurable findings, the results are incorporated into an updated report. We evaluate FactCheXcker on endotracheal tube placement, which accounts for an average of 78% of report measurements, using the MIMIC-CXR dataset and 11 medical report-generation models. Our results show that FactCheXcker significantly reduces hallucinations, improves measurement precision, and maintains the quality of the original reports. Specifically, FactCheXcker improves the performance of all 11 models and achieves an average improvement of 94.0% in reducing measurement hallucinations measured by mean absolute error.|Alice Heiman et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18672)|null|
|**2024-11-27**|**Optimized Conformal Selection: Powerful Selective Inference After Conformity Score Optimization**|Model selection/optimization in conformal inference is challenging, since it may break the exchangeability between labeled and unlabeled data. We study this problem in the context of conformal selection, which uses conformal p-values to select ``interesting'' instances with large unobserved labels from a pool of unlabeled data, while controlling the FDR in finite sample. For validity, existing solutions require the model choice to be independent of the data used to construct the p-values and calibrate the selection set. However, when presented with many model choices and limited labeled data, it is desirable to (i) select the best model in a data-driven manner, and (ii) mitigate power loss due to sample splitting.   This paper presents OptCS, a general framework that allows valid statistical testing (selection) after flexible data-driven model optimization. We introduce general conditions under which OptCS constructs valid conformal p-values despite substantial data reuse and handles complex p-value dependencies to maintain finite-sample FDR control via a novel multiple testing procedure. We instantiate this general recipe to propose three FDR-controlling procedures, each optimizing the models differently: (i) selecting the most powerful one among multiple pre-trained candidate models, (ii) using all data for model fitting without sample splitting, and (iii) combining full-sample model fitting and selection. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods via simulation studies and real applications in drug discovery and alignment of large language models in radiology report generation.|Tian Bai et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17983)|null|
|**2024-11-26**|**HOPPR Medical-Grade Platform for Medical Imaging AI**|Technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of large vision language models (LVLMs) that are trained on millions of paired image and text samples. Subsequent research efforts have demonstrated great potential of LVLMs to achieve high performance in medical imaging use cases (e.g., radiology report generation), but there remain barriers that hinder the ability to deploy these solutions broadly. These include the cost of extensive computational requirements for developing large scale models, expertise in the development of sophisticated AI models, and the difficulty in accessing substantially large, high-quality datasets that adequately represent the population in which the LVLM solution is to be deployed. The HOPPR Medical-Grade Platform addresses these barriers by providing powerful computational infrastructure, a suite of foundation models on top of which developers can fine-tune for their specific use cases, and a robust quality management system that sets a standard for evaluating fine-tuned models for deployment in clinical settings. The HOPPR Platform has access to millions of imaging studies and text reports sourced from hundreds of imaging centers from diverse populations to pretrain foundation models and enable use case-specific cohorts for fine-tuning. All data are deidentified and securely stored for HIPAA compliance. Additionally, developers can securely host models on the HOPPR platform and access them via an API to make inferences using these models within established clinical workflows. With the Medical-Grade Platform, HOPPR's mission is to expedite the deployment of LVLM solutions for medical imaging and ultimately optimize radiologist's workflows and meet the growing demands of the field.|Kalina P.

|**2024-11-26**|**ER2Score: LLM-based Explainable and Customizable Metric for Assessing Radiology Reports with Reward-Control Loss**|Automated radiology report generation (R2Gen) has advanced significantly, introducing challenges in accurate evaluation due to its complexity. Traditional metrics often fall short by relying on rigid word-matching or focusing only on pathological entities, leading to inconsistencies with human assessments. To bridge this gap, we introduce ER2Score, an automatic evaluation metric designed specifically for R2Gen. Our metric utilizes a reward model, guided by our margin-based reward enforcement loss, along with a tailored training data design that enables customization of evaluation criteria to suit user-defined needs. It not only scores reports according to user-specified criteria but also provides detailed sub-scores, enhancing interpretability and allowing users to adjust the criteria between different aspects of reports. Leveraging GPT-4, we designed an easy-to-use data generation pipeline, enabling us to produce extensive training data based on two distinct scoring systems, each containing reports of varying quality along with corresponding scores. These GPT-generated reports are then paired as accepted and rejected samples through our pairing rule to train an LLM towards our fine-grained reward model, which assigns higher rewards to the report with high quality. Our reward-control loss enables this model to simultaneously output multiple individual rewards corresponding to the number of evaluation criteria, with their summation as our final ER2Score. Our experiments demonstrate ER2Score's heightened correlation with human judgments and superior performance in model selection compared to traditional metrics. Notably, our model provides both an overall score and individual scores for each evaluation item, enhancing interpretability. We also demonstrate its flexible training across various evaluation systems.|Yunyi Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17301)|null|
|**2024-11-25**|**LaB-RAG: Label Boosted Retrieval Augmented Generation for Radiology Report Generation**|In the current paradigm of image captioning, deep learning models are trained to generate text from image embeddings of latent features. We challenge the assumption that these latent features ought to be high-dimensional vectors which require model fine tuning to handle. Here we propose Label Boosted Retrieval Augmented Generation (LaB-RAG), a text-based approach to image captioning that leverages image descriptors in the form of categorical labels to boost standard retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with pretrained large language models (LLMs). We study our method in the context of radiology report generation (RRG), where the task is to generate a clinician's report detailing their observations from a set of radiological images, such as X-rays. We argue that simple linear classifiers over extracted image embeddings can effectively transform X-rays into text-space as radiology-specific labels. In combination with standard RAG, we show that these derived text labels can be used with general-domain LLMs to generate radiology reports. Without ever training our generative language model or image feature encoder models, and without ever directly "showing" the LLM an X-ray, we demonstrate that LaB-RAG achieves better results across natural language and radiology language metrics compared with other retrieval-based RRG methods, while attaining competitive results compared to other fine-tuned vision-language RRG models. We further present results of our experiments with various components of LaB-RAG to better understand our method. Finally, we critique the use of a popular RRG metric, arguing it is possible to artificially inflate its results without true data-leakage.|Steven Song et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16523)|null|
|**2024-11-23**|**Improving Factuality of 3D Brain MRI Report Generation with Paired Image-domain Retrieval and Text-domain Augmentation**|Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) requires time-critical management, with hours of delayed intervention leading to an irreversible disability of the patient. Since diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) using the magnetic resonance image (MRI) plays a crucial role in the detection of AIS, automated prediction of AIS from DWI has been a research topic of clinical importance. While text radiology reports contain the most relevant clinical information from the image findings, the difficulty of mapping across different modalities has limited the factuality of conventional direct DWI-to-report generation methods. Here, we propose paired image-domain retrieval and text-domain augmentation (PIRTA), a cross-modal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for providing clinician-interpretative AIS radiology reports with improved factuality. PIRTA mitigates the need for learning cross-modal mapping, which poses difficulty in image-to-text generation, by casting the cross-modal mapping problem as an in-domain retrieval of similar DWI images that have paired ground-truth text radiology reports. By exploiting the retrieved radiology reports to augment the report generation process of the query image, we show by experiments with extensive in-house and public datasets that PIRTA can accurately retrieve relevant reports from 3D DWI images. This approach enables the generation of radiology reports with significantly higher accuracy compared to direct image-to-text generation using state-of-the-art multimodal language models.|Junhyeok Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15490)|null|

However, there is no standardized benchmark for objectively evaluating their performance. To address this, we present ReXrank, https://rexrank.ai, a public leaderboard and challenge for assessing AI-powered radiology report generation. Our framework incorporates ReXGradient, the largest test dataset consisting of 10,000 studies, and three public datasets (MIMIC-CXR, IU-Xray, CheXpert Plus) for report generation assessment. ReXrank employs 8 evaluation metrics and separately assesses models capable of generating only findings sections and those providing both findings and impressions sections. By providing this standardized evaluation framework, ReXrank enables meaningful comparisons of model performance and offers crucial insights into their robustness across diverse clinical settings. Beyond its current focus on chest X-rays, ReXrank's framework sets the stage for comprehensive evaluation of automated reporting across the full spectrum of medical imaging.|Xiaoman Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15122)|null|

While impression summary generation has been the primary task which has been explored in prior works w.r.t radiology reports of Chest X-rays, we also explore other useful tasks like change summary generation comparing the current radiology report and its prior report, section extraction from radiology reports, tagging the reports with various pathologies and tubes, lines or devices present in them etc. In-addition, instruction tuning RadPhi-3 involved learning from a credible knowledge source used by radiologists, Radiopaedia.org.

|**2024-11-20**|**ORID: Organ-Regional Information Driven Framework for Radiology Report Generation**|The objective of Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is to automatically generate coherent textual analyses of diseases based on radiological images, thereby alleviating the workload of radiologists. Current AI-based methods for RRG primarily focus on modifications to the encoder-decoder model architecture. To advance these approaches, this paper introduces an Organ-Regional Information Driven (ORID) framework which can effectively integrate multi-modal information and reduce the influence of noise from unrelated organs. Specifically, based on the LLaVA-Med, we first construct an RRG-related instruction dataset to improve organ-regional diagnosis description ability and get the LLaVA-Med-RRG. After that, we propose an organ-based cross-modal fusion module to effectively combine the information from the organ-regional diagnosis description and radiology image. To further reduce the influence of noise from unrelated organs on the radiology report generation, we introduce an organ importance coefficient analysis module, which leverages Graph Neural Network (GNN) to examine the interconnections of the cross-modal information of each organ region. Extensive experiments an1d comparisons with state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation metrics demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.|Tiancheng Gu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13025)|null|
|**2024-11-19**|**A Survey of Medical Vision-and-Language Applications and Their Techniques**|Medical vision-and-language models (MVLMs) have attracted substantial interest due to their capability to offer a natural language interface for interpreting complex medical data. Their applications are versatile and have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and decision-making for individual patients while also contributing to enhanced public health monitoring, disease surveillance, and policy-making through more efficient analysis of large data sets. MVLMS integrate natural language processing with medical images to enable a more comprehensive and contextual understanding of medical images alongside their corresponding textual information. Unlike general vision-and-language models trained on diverse, non-specialized datasets, MVLMs are purpose-built for the medical domain, automatically extracting and interpreting critical information from medical images and textual reports to support clinical decision-making. Popular clinical applications of MVLMs include automated medical report generation, medical visual question answering, medical multimodal segmentation, diagnosis and prognosis and medical image-text retrieval. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of MVLMs and the various medical tasks to which they have been applied. We conduct a detailed analysis of various vision-and-language model architectures, focusing on their distinct strategies for cross-modal integration/exploitation of medical visual and textual features. We also examine the datasets used for these tasks and compare the performance of different models based on standardized evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we highlight potential challenges and summarize future research trends and directions.

|**2024-11-18**|**MAIRA-Seg: Enhancing Radiology Report Generation with Segmentation-Aware Multimodal Large Language Models**|There is growing interest in applying AI to radiology report generation, particularly for chest X-rays (CXRs). This paper investigates whether incorporating pixel-level information through segmentation masks can improve fine-grained image interpretation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for radiology report generation. We introduce MAIRA-Seg, a segmentation-aware MLLM framework designed to utilize semantic segmentation masks alongside CXRs for generating radiology reports. We train expert segmentation models to obtain mask pseudolabels for radiology-specific structures in CXRs. Subsequently, building on the architectures of MAIRA, a CXR-specialised model for report generation, we integrate a trainable segmentation tokens extractor that leverages these mask pseudolabels, and employ mask-aware prompting to generate draft radiology reports. Our experiments on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR dataset show that MAIRA-Seg outperforms non-segmentation baselines. We also investigate set-of-marks prompting with MAIRA and find that MAIRA-Seg consistently demonstrates comparable or superior performance. The results confirm that using segmentation masks enhances the nuanced reasoning of MLLMs, potentially contributing to better clinical outcomes.|Harshita Sharma et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11362)|null|
|**2024-11-16**|**Anatomy-Guided Radiology Report Generation with Pathology-Aware Regional Prompts**|Radiology reporting generative AI holds significant potential to alleviate clinical workloads and streamline medical care. However, achieving high clinical accuracy is challenging, as radiological images often feature subtle lesions and intricate structures. Existing systems often fall short, largely due to their reliance on fixed size, patch-level image features and insufficient incorporation of pathological information. This can result in the neglect of such subtle patterns and inconsistent descriptions of crucial pathologies. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach that leverages pathology-aware regional prompts to explicitly integrate anatomical and pathological information of various scales, significantly enhancing the precision and clinical relevance of generated reports. We develop an anatomical region detector that extracts features from distinct anatomical areas, coupled with a novel multi-label lesion detector that identifies global pathologies. Our approach emulates the diagnostic process of radiologists, producing clinically accurate reports with comprehensive diagnostic capabilities. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on most natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics, with formal expert evaluations affirming its potential to enhance radiology practice.|Yijian Gao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10789)|null|
|**2024-11-15**|**MCL: Multi-view Enhanced Contrastive Learning for Chest X-ray Report Generation**|Radiology reports are crucial for planning treatment strategies and enhancing doctor-patient communication, yet manually writing these reports is burdensome for radiologists. While automatic report generation offers a solution, existing methods often rely on single-view radiographs, limiting diagnostic accuracy. To address this problem, we propose MCL, a Multi-view enhanced Contrastive Learning method for chest X-ray report generation. Specifically, we first introduce multi-view enhanced contrastive learning for visual representation by maximizing agreements between multi-view radiographs and their corresponding report. Subsequently, to fully exploit patient-specific indications (e.g., patient's symptoms) for report generation, we add a transitional ``bridge" for missing indications to reduce embedding space discrepancies caused by their presence or absence. Additionally, we construct Multi-view CXR and Two-view CXR datasets from public sources to support research on multi-view report generation. Our proposed MCL surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, achieving a 5.0% F1 RadGraph improvement on MIMIC-CXR, a 7.3% BLEU-1 improvement on MIMIC-ABN, a 3.1% BLEU-4 improvement on Multi-view CXR, and an 8.2% F1 CheXbert improvement on Two-view CXR.|Kang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10224)|**[link](https://github.com/mk-runner/mcl)**|
|**2024-11-15**|**JRadiEvo: A Japanese Radiology Report Generation Model Enhanced by Evolutionary Optimization of Model Merging**|With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), foundational models (FMs) have seen significant advancements. Healthcare is one of the most crucial application areas for these FMs, given the significant time and effort required for physicians to analyze large volumes of patient data. Recent efforts have focused on adapting multimodal FMs to the medical domain through techniques like instruction-tuning, leading to the development of medical foundation models (MFMs). However, these approaches typically require large amounts of training data to effectively adapt models to the medical field. Moreover, most existing models are trained on English datasets, limiting their practicality in non-English-speaking regions where healthcare professionals and patients are not always fluent in English. The need for translation introduces additional costs and inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{J}apanese \textbf{Radi}ology report generation model enhanced by \textbf{Evo}lutionary optimization of model merging (JRadiEvo). This is the first attempt to extend a non-medical vision-language foundation model to the medical domain through evolutionary optimization of model merging. We successfully created a model that generates accurate Japanese reports from X-ray images using only 50 translated samples from publicly available data. This model, developed with highly efficient use of limited data, outperformed leading models from recent research trained on much larger datasets. Additionally, with only 8 billion parameters, this relatively compact foundation model can be deployed locally within hospitals, making it a practical solution for environments where APIs and other external services cannot be used due to strict privacy and security requirements.|Kaito Baba et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09933)|null|
|**2024-11-07**|**PadChest-GR: A Bilingual Chest X-ray Dataset for Grounded Radiology Report Generation**|Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to create free-text radiology reports from clinical imaging. Grounded radiology report generation (GRRG) extends RRG by including the localisation of individual findings on the image. Currently, there are no manually annotated chest X-ray (CXR) datasets to train GRRG models. In this work, we present a dataset called PadChest-GR (Grounded-Reporting) derived from PadChest aimed at training GRRG models for CXR images. We curate a public bi-lingual dataset of 4,555 CXR studies with grounded reports (3,099 abnormal and 1,456 normal), each containing complete lists of sentences describing individual present (positive) and absent (negative) findings in English and Spanish. In total, PadChest-GR contains 7,037 positive and 3,422 negative finding sentences. Every positive finding sentence is associated with up to two independent sets of bounding boxes labelled by different readers and has categorical labels for finding type, locations, and progression. To the best of our knowledge, PadChest-GR is the first manually curated dataset designed to train GRRG models for understanding and interpreting radiological images and generated text. By including detailed localization and comprehensive annotations of all clinically relevant findings, it provides a valuable resource for developing and evaluating GRRG models from CXR images.

|**2024-11-06**|**Improving Radiology Report Conciseness and Structure via Local Large Language Models**|In this study, we aim to enhance radiology reporting by improving both the conciseness and structured organization of findings (also referred to as templating), specifically by organizing information according to anatomical regions. This structured approach allows physicians to locate relevant information quickly, increasing the report's utility. We utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Mixtral, Mistral, and Llama to generate concise, well-structured reports. Among these, we primarily focus on the Mixtral model due to its superior adherence to specific formatting requirements compared to other models. To maintain data security and privacy, we run these LLMs locally behind our institution's firewall. We leverage the LangChain framework and apply five distinct prompting strategies to enforce a consistent structure in radiology reports, aiming to eliminate extraneous language and achieve a high level of conciseness. We also introduce a novel metric, the Conciseness Percentage (CP) score, to evaluate report brevity. Our dataset comprises 814 radiology reports authored by seven board-certified body radiologists at our cancer center. In evaluating the different prompting methods, we discovered that the most effective approach for generating concise, well-structured reports involves first instructing the LLM to condense the report, followed by a prompt to structure the content according to specific guidelines. We assessed all prompting strategies based on their ability to handle formatting issues, reduce report length, and adhere to formatting instructions. Our findings demonstrate that open-source, locally deployed LLMs can significantly improve radiology report conciseness and structure while conforming to specified formatting standards.|Iryna Hartsock et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05042)|**[link](https://github.com/lab-rasool/radiology-reporting-with-llms)**|

Taking inspiration from image captioning, the task of radiology report generation aims at automatically generating radiology reports by having a comprehensive understanding of medical images. However, automatically generating radiology reports from medical images is a challenging task due to the complexity, diversity, and nature of medical images. In this paper, we outline the design of a robust radiology report generation system by integrating different modules and highlighting best practices drawing upon lessons from our past work and also from relevant studies in the literature. We also discuss the impact of integrating different components to form a single integrated system. We believe that these best practices, when implemented, could improve automatic radiology report generation, augment radiologists in decision making, and expedite diagnostic workflow, in turn improve healthcare and save human lives.|Sonit Singh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01153)|null|
|**2024-11-01**|**Tumor Location-weighted MRI-Report Contrastive Learning: A Framework for Improving the Explainability of Pediatric Brain Tumor Diagnosis**|Despite the promising performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in brain tumor diagnosis from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), their integration into the clinical workflow has been limited. That is mainly due to the fact that the features contributing to a model's prediction are unclear to radiologists and hence, clinically irrelevant, i.e., lack of explainability. As the invaluable sources of radiologists' knowledge and expertise, radiology reports can be integrated with MRI in a contrastive learning (CL) framework, enabling learning from image-report associations, to improve CNN explainability. In this work, we train a multimodal CL architecture on 3D brain MRI scans and radiology reports to learn informative MRI representations. Furthermore, we integrate tumor location, salient to several brain tumor analysis tasks, into this framework to improve its generalizability. We then apply the learnt image representations to improve explainability and performance of genetic marker classification of pediatric Low-grade Glioma, the most prevalent brain tumor in children, as a downstream task. Our results indicate a Dice score of 31.1% between the model's attention maps and manual tumor segmentation (as an explainability measure) with test classification performance of 87.7%, significantly outperforming the baselines.

While current Vision Language Models (VLMs) show promise, they are prone to generating hallucinations, potentially compromising patient care. We introduce RadFlag, a black-box method to enhance the accuracy of radiology report generation. Our method uses a sampling-based flagging technique to find hallucinatory generations that should be removed. We first sample multiple reports at varying temperatures and then use a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify claims that are not consistently supported across samples, indicating that the model has low confidence in those claims. Using a calibrated threshold, we flag a fraction of these claims as likely hallucinations, which should undergo extra review or be automatically rejected. Our method achieves high precision when identifying both individual hallucinatory sentences and reports that contain hallucinations. As an easy-to-use, black-box system that only requires access to a model's temperature parameter, RadFlag is compatible with a wide range of radiology report generation models and has the potential to broadly improve the quality of automated radiology reporting.|Serena Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00299)|null|

Advances in diagnosis, risk stratification, and prevention can improve outcomes. There are few large publicly available datasets that contain PE labels for research. Using the MIMIC-IV database, we extracted all available radiology reports of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) scans and two physicians manually labeled the results as PE positive (acute PE) or PE negative. We then applied a previously finetuned Bio_ClinicalBERT transformer language model, VTE-BERT, to extract labels automatically. We verified VTE-BERT's reliability by measuring its performance against manual adjudication. We also compared the performance of VTE-BERT to diagnosis codes. We found that VTE-BERT has a sensitivity of 92.4% and positive predictive value (PPV) of 87.8% on all 19,942 patients with CTPA radiology reports from the emergency room and/or hospital admission. In contrast, diagnosis codes have a sensitivity of 95.4% and PPV of 83.8% on the subset of 11,990 hospitalized patients with discharge diagnosis codes.

|**2024-10-31**|**The Potential of LLMs in Medical Education: Generating Questions and Answers for Qualification Exams**|Recent research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on their adaptation and application in specialized domains. The application of LLMs in the medical field is mainly concentrated on tasks such as the automation of medical report generation, summarization, diagnostic reasoning, and question-and-answer interactions between doctors and patients. The challenge of becoming a good teacher is more formidable than that of becoming a good student, and this study pioneers the application of LLMs in the field of medical education. In this work, we investigate the extent to which LLMs can generate medical qualification exam questions and corresponding answers based on few-shot prompts. Utilizing a real-world Chinese dataset of elderly chronic diseases, we tasked the LLMs with generating open-ended questions and answers based on a subset of sampled admission reports across eight widely used LLMs, including ERNIE 4, ChatGLM 4, Doubao, Hunyuan, Spark 4, Qwen, Llama 3, and Mistral. Furthermore, we engaged medical experts to manually evaluate these open-ended questions and answers across multiple dimensions. The study found that LLMs, after using few-shot prompts, can effectively mimic real-world medical qualification exam questions, whereas there is room for improvement in the correctness, evidence-based statements, and professionalism of the generated answers. Moreover, LLMs also demonstrate a decent level of ability to correct and rectify reference answers. Given the immense potential of artificial intelligence in the medical field, the task of generating questions and answers for medical qualification exams aimed at medical students, interns and residents can be a significant focus of future research.|Yunqi Zhu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23769)|null|

Existingresearch predominantly utilizes Transformers to generateradiology reports, which can be computationally intensive,limiting their use in real applications. In this work, we presentR2Gen-Mamba, a novel automatic radiology report genera-tion method that leverages the efficient sequence processingof the Mamba with the contextual benefits of Transformerarchitectures. Due to lower computational complexity ofMamba, R2Gen-Mamba not only enhances training and in-ference efficiency but also produces high-quality reports.Experimental results on two benchmark datasets with morethan 210,000 X-ray image-report pairs demonstrate the ef-fectiveness of R2Gen-Mamba regarding report quality andcomputational efficiency compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

It aims to overcome the limitations of existing evaluation methods, which either focus solely on textual similarities, ignoring clinical aspects, or concentrate only on a single clinical aspect, the pathology, neglecting all other factors. The key idea of our metric is to measure the similarity between radiology reports while considering the corresponding image. We demonstrate the benefit of our metric through evaluation on a dataset where radiologists marked errors in pairs of reports, showing notable alignment with radiologists' judgments. In addition, we provide a new dataset for evaluating metrics. This dataset includes well-designed perturbations that distinguish between significant modifications (e.g., removal of a diagnosis) and insignificant ones. It highlights the weaknesses in current evaluation metrics and provides a clear framework for analysis.|Gefen Dawidowicz et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17357)|null|

The efficacy of our labelling method is measured on five distinct conditions: spinal cancer, stenosis, spondylolisthesis, cauda equina compression and herniation. Using open-source models, our method equals or surpasses GPT-4 on a held-out set of reports. Furthermore, we show that the extracted labels can be used to train imaging models to classify the identified conditions in the accompanying MR scans. All classifiers trained using automated labels achieve comparable performance to models trained using scans manually annotated by clinicians.

|**2024-10-21**|**Resource-Efficient Medical Report Generation using Large Language Models**|Medical report generation is the task of automatically writing radiology reports for chest X-ray images. Manually composing these reports is a time-consuming process that is also prone to human errors. Generating medical reports can therefore help reduce the burden on radiologists. In other words, we can promote greater clinical automation in the medical domain. In this work, we propose a new framework leveraging vision-enabled Large Language Models (LLM) for the task of medical report generation. We introduce a lightweight solution that achieves better or comparative performance as compared to previous solutions on the task of medical report generation. We conduct extensive experiments exploring different model sizes and enhancement approaches, such as prefix tuning to improve the text generation abilities of the LLMs. We evaluate our approach on a prominent large-scale radiology report dataset - MIMIC-CXR.

|**2024-10-17**|**Can Medical Vision-Language Pre-training Succeed with Purely Synthetic Data?**|Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (MedVLP) has made significant progress in enabling zero-shot tasks for medical image understanding. However, training MedVLP models typically requires large-scale datasets with paired, high-quality image-text data, which are scarce in the medical domain. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models have made it possible to generate large-scale synthetic image-text pairs. This raises the question: "Can MedVLP succeed using purely synthetic data?" To address this, we use off-the-shelf generative models to create synthetic radiology reports and paired Chest X-ray (CXR) images, and propose an automated pipeline to build a diverse, high-quality synthetic dataset, enabling a rigorous study that isolates model and training settings, focusing entirely from the data perspective. Our results show that MedVLP models trained exclusively on synthetic data outperform those trained on real data by 3.8% in averaged AUC on zero-shot classification. Moreover, using a combination of synthetic and real data leads to a further improvement of 9.07%. Additionally, MedVLP models trained on synthetic or mixed data consistently outperform those trained on real data in zero-shot grounding, as well as in fine-tuned classification and segmentation tasks. Our analysis suggests MedVLP trained on well-designed synthetic data can outperform models trained on real datasets, which may be limited by low-quality samples and long-tailed distributions.|Che Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13523)|null|

Modern large language models (LLMs), like Llama-2, offer promise for automating the mapping of these landmarks in free-text radiology reports to corresponding positions in image data. Recent studies propose LLMs may develop coherent representations of generative processes. Motivated by these insights, we investigated whether LLMs accurately represent the spatial positions of anatomical landmarks. Through experiments with Llama-2 models, we found that they can linearly represent anatomical landmarks in space with considerable robustness to different prompts. These results underscore the potential of LLMs to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of medical imaging workflows.|Mohamad Abdi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12686)|null|
|**2024-10-14**|**Performance Evaluation of Deep Learning and Transformer Models Using Multimodal Data for Breast Cancer Classification**|Rising breast cancer (BC) occurrence and mortality are major global concerns for women. Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated superior diagnostic performance in BC classification compared to human expert readers. However, the predominant use of unimodal (digital mammography) features may limit the current performance of diagnostic models. To address this, we collected a novel multimodal dataset comprising both imaging and textual data. This study proposes a multimodal DL architecture for BC classification, utilising images (mammograms; four views) and textual data (radiological reports) from our new in-house dataset. Various augmentation techniques were applied to enhance the training data size for both imaging and textual data. We explored the performance of eleven SOTA DL architectures (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet34, ResNet50, MobileNet-v3, EffNet-b0, EffNet-b1, EffNet-b2, EffNet-b3, EffNet-b7, and Vision Transformer (ViT)) as imaging feature extractors. For textual feature extraction, we utilised either artificial neural networks (ANNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The combined imaging and textual features were then inputted into an ANN classifier for BC classification, using the late fusion technique. We evaluated different feature extractor and classifier arrangements. The VGG19 and ANN combinations achieved the highest accuracy of 0.951. For precision, the VGG19 and ANN combination again surpassed other CNN and LSTM, ANN based architectures by achieving a score of 0.95. The best sensitivity score of 0.903 was achieved by the VGG16+LSTM. The highest F1 score of 0.931 was achieved by VGG19+LSTM. Only the VGG16+LSTM achieved the best area under the curve (AUC) of 0.937, with VGG16+LSTM closely following with a 0.929 AUC score.|Sadam Hussain et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10146)|null|
|**2024-10-13**|**Retrieval Instead of Fine-tuning: A Retrieval-based Parameter Ensemble for Zero-shot Learning**|Foundation models have become a cornerstone in deep learning, with techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offering efficient fine-tuning of large models. Similarly, methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which leverage vectorized databases, have further improved model performance by grounding outputs in external information. While these approaches have demonstrated notable success, they often require extensive training or labeled data, which can limit their adaptability in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-based Parameter Ensemble (RPE), a new method that creates a vectorized database of LoRAs, enabling efficient retrieval and application of model adaptations to new tasks. RPE minimizes the need for extensive training and eliminates the requirement for labeled data, making it particularly effective for zero-shot learning. Additionally, RPE is well-suited for privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare, as it modifies model parameters without accessing raw data. When applied to tasks such as medical report generation and image segmentation, RPE not only proved effective but also surpassed supervised fine-tuning methods in certain cases, highlighting its potential to enhance both computational efficiency and privacy in deep learning applications.|Pengfei Jin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09908)|null|
|**2024-10-11**|**Fine-Tuning In-House Large Language Models to Infer Differential Diagnosis from Radiology Reports**|Radiology reports summarize key findings and differential diagnoses derived from medical imaging examinations. The extraction of differential diagnoses is crucial for downstream tasks, including patient management and treatment planning. However, the unstructured nature of these reports, characterized by diverse linguistic styles and inconsistent formatting, presents significant challenges. Although proprietary large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 can effectively retrieve clinical information, their use is limited in practice by high costs and concerns over the privacy of protected health information (PHI). This study introduces a pipeline for developing in-house LLMs tailored to identify differential diagnoses from radiology reports. We first utilize GPT-4 to create 31,056 labeled reports, then fine-tune open source LLM using this dataset. Evaluated on a set of 1,067 reports annotated by clinicians, the proposed model achieves an average F1 score of 92.1\%, which is on par with GPT-4 (90.8\%). Through this study, we provide a methodology for constructing in-house LLMs that: match the performance of GPT, reduce dependence on expensive proprietary models, and enhance the privacy and security of PHI.|Luoyao Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09234)|null|

MRG systems can enhance radiological workflows by reducing the time and effort required for report writing, thereby improving diagnostic efficiency. In this work, we present a novel approach for automatic MRG utilizing a multimodal large language model. Specifically, we employed the 3D Vision Transformer (ViT3D) image encoder introduced from M3D-CLIP to process 3D scans and use the Asclepius-Llama3-8B as the language model to generate the text reports by auto-regressive decoding. The experiment shows our model achieved an average Green score of 0.3 on the MRG task validation set and an average accuracy of 0.61 on the visual question answering (VQA) task validation set, outperforming the baseline model. Our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of the ViT3D alignment of LLaMA3 for automatic MRG and VQA tasks by tuning the model on a small dataset.|Siyou Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08588)|null|
|**2024-10-04**|**An X-Ray Is Worth 15 Features: Sparse Autoencoders for Interpretable Radiology Report Generation**|Radiological services are experiencing unprecedented demand, leading to increased interest in automating radiology report generation. Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) suffer from hallucinations, lack interpretability, and require expensive fine-tuning. We introduce SAE-Rad, which uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose latent representations from a pre-trained vision transformer into human-interpretable features. Our hybrid architecture combines state-of-the-art SAE advancements, achieving accurate latent reconstructions while maintaining sparsity. Using an off-the-shelf language model, we distil ground-truth reports into radiological descriptions for each SAE feature, which we then compile into a full report for each image, eliminating the need for fine-tuning large models for this task. To the best of our knowledge, SAE-Rad represents the first instance of using mechanistic interpretability techniques explicitly for a downstream multi-modal reasoning task. On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, SAE-Rad achieves competitive radiology-specific metrics compared to state-of-the-art models while using significantly fewer computational resources for training. Qualitative analysis reveals that SAE-Rad learns meaningful visual concepts and generates reports aligning closely with expert interpretations. Our results suggest that SAEs can enhance multimodal reasoning in healthcare, providing a more interpretable alternative to existing VLMs.|Ahmed Abdulaal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03334)|null|

|**2024-10-01**|**CXPMRG-Bench: Pre-training and Benchmarking for X-ray Medical Report Generation on CheXpert Plus Dataset**|X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in artificial intelligence which can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens and patient wait times. Despite significant progress, we believe that the task has reached a bottleneck due to the limited benchmark datasets and the existing large models' insufficient capability enhancements in this specialized domain. Specifically, the recently released CheXpert Plus dataset lacks comparative evaluation algorithms and their results, providing only the dataset itself. This situation makes the training, evaluation, and comparison of subsequent algorithms challenging. Thus, we conduct a comprehensive benchmarking of existing mainstream X-ray report generation models and large language models (LLMs), on the CheXpert Plus dataset. We believe that the proposed benchmark can provide a solid comparative basis for subsequent algorithms and serve as a guide for researchers to quickly grasp the state-of-the-art models in this field. More importantly, we propose a large model for the X-ray image report generation using a multi-stage pre-training strategy, including self-supervised autoregressive generation and Xray-report contrastive learning, and supervised fine-tuning. Extensive experimental results indicate that the autoregressive pre-training based on Mamba effectively encodes X-ray images, and the image-text contrastive pre-training further aligns the feature spaces, achieving better experimental results.

Numerous efforts employ generative models to generate high-fidelity, unlabeled 3D volumes across diverse modalities and anatomical regions. However, the intricate and indistinguishable anatomical structures within the abdomen pose a unique challenge to abdominal CT volume generation compared to other anatomical regions. To address the overlooked challenge, we introduce the Locality-Aware Diffusion (Lad), a novel method tailored for exquisite 3D abdominal CT volume generation. We design a locality loss to refine crucial anatomical regions and devise a condition extractor to integrate abdominal priori into generation, thereby enabling the generation of large quantities of high-quality abdominal CT volumes essential for SSL tasks without the need for additional data such as labels or radiology reports. Volumes generated through our method demonstrate remarkable fidelity in reproducing abdominal structures, achieving a decrease in FID score from 0.0034 to 0.0002 on AbdomenCT-1K dataset, closely mirroring authentic data and surpassing current methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in self-supervised organ segmentation tasks, resulting in an improvement in mean Dice scores on two abdominal datasets effectively.

There is yet no consensus on how to approach this problem. We evaluated a set of NLP models including BERT-like transformers, few-shot learning with sentence transformers (SetFit), and prompted large language models (LLM), using three datasets of radiology reports on magnetic resonance images of epilepsy patients in Danish, a low-resource language. Our results indicate that BERT-like models pretrained in the target domain of radiology reports currently offer the optimal performances for this scenario. Notably, the SetFit and LLM models underperformed compared to BERT-like models, with LLM performing the worst. Importantly, none of the models investigated was sufficiently accurate to allow for text classification without any supervision.

The demand for automated report generation systems has become increasingly urgent. While prior research has mainly focused on using machine learning and multimodal language models for 2D medical images, the generation of reports for 3D medical images has been less explored due to data scarcity and computational complexities. This paper introduces 3D-CT-GPT, a Visual Question Answering (VQA)-based medical visual language model specifically designed for generating radiology reports from 3D CT scans, particularly chest CTs. Extensive experiments on both public and private datasets demonstrate that 3D-CT-GPT significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of report accuracy and quality. Although current methods are few, including the partially open-source CT2Rep and the open-source M3D, we ensured fair comparison through appropriate data conversion and evaluation methodologies. Experimental results indicate that 3D-CT-GPT enhances diagnostic accuracy and report coherence, establishing itself as a robust solution for clinical radiology report generation.

Current LLMs in creating structured reports face the challenges of formatting errors, content hallucinations, and privacy leakage concerns when uploaded to external servers. We aim to develop an enhanced open-source LLM for creating structured and standardized LCS reports from free-text descriptions. After institutional IRB approvals, 5,442 de-identified LCS reports from two institutions were retrospectively analyzed. 500 reports were randomly selected from the two institutions evenly and then manually labeled for evaluation. Two radiologists from the two institutions developed a standardized template including 29 features for lung nodule reporting. We proposed template-constrained decoding to enhance state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, including LLAMA, Qwen, and Mistral. The LLM performance was extensively evaluated in terms of F1 score, confidence interval, McNemar test, and z-test. Based on the structured reports created from the large-scale dataset, a nodule-level retrieval system was prototyped and an automatic statistical analysis was performed. Our software, vLLM-structure, is publicly available for local deployment with enhanced LLMs. Our template-constrained decoding approach consistently enhanced the LLM performance on multi-institutional datasets, with neither formatting errors nor content hallucinations. Our method improved the best open-source LLAMA-3.1 405B by up to 10.42%, and outperformed GPT-4o by 17.19%.

Among these are the constraints on model size and the lack of cohort-specific labeled datasets. In this work, we investigated the potential of improving a lightweight LLM, such as Llama 3.1-8B, through fine-tuning with datasets using synthetic labels. Two tasks are jointly trained by combining their respective instruction datasets. When the quality of the task-specific synthetic labels is relatively high (e.g., generated by GPT4- o), Llama 3.1-8B achieves satisfactory performance on the open-ended disease detection task, with a micro F1 score of 0.91. Conversely, when the quality of the task-relevant synthetic labels is relatively low (e.g., from the MIMIC-CXR dataset), fine-tuned Llama 3.1-8B is able to surpass its noisy teacher labels (micro F1 score of 0.67 v.s. 0.63) when calibrated against curated labels, indicating the strong inherent underlying capability of the model.

Methods and Materials: The study utilized two datasets: 7,294 radiology reports annotated for Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS) scores and 2,154 pathology reports annotated for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. An automated pipeline was developed to benchmark the performance of various LMs and RAG configurations. The impact of model size, quantization, prompting strategies, output formatting, and inference parameters was systematically evaluated. Results: The best performing models achieved over 98% accuracy in extracting BT-RADS scores from radiology reports and over 90% for IDH mutation status extraction from pathology reports. The top model being medical fine-tuned llama3. Larger, newer, and domain fine-tuned models consistently outperformed older and smaller models. Model quantization had minimal impact on performance. Few-shot prompting significantly improved accuracy. RAG improved performance for complex pathology reports but not for shorter radiology reports. Conclusions: Open LMs demonstrate significant potential for automated extraction of structured clinical data from unstructured clinical reports with local privacy-preserving application.

|**2024-09-09**|**KARGEN: Knowledge-enhanced Automated Radiology Report Generation Using Large Language Models**|Harnessing the robust capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for narrative generation, logical reasoning, and common-sense knowledge integration, this study delves into utilizing LLMs to enhance automated radiology report generation (R2Gen). Despite the wealth of knowledge within LLMs, efficiently triggering relevant knowledge within these large models for specific tasks like R2Gen poses a critical research challenge. This paper presents KARGEN, a Knowledge-enhanced Automated radiology Report GENeration framework based on LLMs. Utilizing a frozen LLM to generate reports, the framework integrates a knowledge graph to unlock chest disease-related knowledge within the LLM to enhance the clinical utility of generated reports. This is achieved by leveraging the knowledge graph to distill disease-related features in a designed way. Since a radiology report encompasses both normal and disease-related findings, the extracted graph-enhanced disease-related features are integrated with regional image features, attending to both aspects. We explore two fusion methods to automatically prioritize and select the most relevant features. The fused features are employed by LLM to generate reports that are more sensitive to diseases and of improved quality. Our approach demonstrates promising results on the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray datasets.|Yingshu Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05370)|null|
|**2024-09-06**|**FODA-PG for Enhanced Medical Imaging Narrative Generation: Adaptive Differentiation of Normal and Abnormal Attributes**|Automatic Medical Imaging Narrative generation aims to alleviate the workload of radiologists by producing accurate clinical descriptions directly from radiological images. However, the subtle visual nuances and domain-specific terminology in medical images pose significant challenges compared to generic image captioning tasks. Existing approaches often neglect the vital distinction between normal and abnormal findings, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose FODA-PG, a novel Fine-grained Organ-Disease Adaptive Partitioning Graph framework that addresses these limitations through domain-adaptive learning. FODA-PG constructs a granular graphical representation of radiological findings by separating disease-related attributes into distinct "disease-specific" and "disease-free" categories based on their clinical significance and location. This adaptive partitioning enables our model to capture the nuanced differences between normal and pathological states, mitigating the impact of data biases. By integrating this fine-grained semantic knowledge into a powerful transformer-based architecture and providing rigorous mathematical justifications for its effectiveness, FODA-PG generates precise and clinically coherent reports with enhanced generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on the IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation in medical report generation.|Kai Shu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03947)|null|
|**2024-09-04**|**A Medical Multimodal Large Language Model for Pediatric Pneumonia**|Pediatric pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children under five years worldwide, imposing a substantial burden on affected families. Currently, there are three significant hurdles in diagnosing and treating pediatric pneumonia. Firstly, pediatric pneumonia shares similar symptoms with other respiratory diseases, making rapid and accurate differential diagnosis challenging. Secondly, primary hospitals often lack sufficient medical resources and experienced doctors. Lastly, providing personalized diagnostic reports and treatment recommendations is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To tackle these challenges, we proposed a Medical Multimodal Large Language Model for Pediatric Pneumonia (P2Med-MLLM). It was capable of handling diverse clinical tasks, such as generating free-text radiology reports and medical records within a unified framework. Specifically, P2Med-MLLM can process both pure text and image-text data, trained on an extensive and large-scale dataset (P2Med-MD), including real clinical information from 163,999 outpatient and 8,684 inpatient cases. This dataset comprised 2D chest X-ray images, 3D chest CT images, corresponding radiology reports, and outpatient and inpatient records. We designed a three-stage training strategy to enable P2Med-MLLM to comprehend medical knowledge and follow instructions for various clinical tasks. To rigorously evaluate P2Med-MLLM's performance, we developed P2Med-MBench, a benchmark consisting of 642 meticulously verified samples by pediatric pulmonology specialists, covering six clinical decision-support tasks and a balanced variety of diseases. The automated scoring results demonstrated the superiority of P2Med-MLLM. This work plays a crucial role in assisting primary care doctors with prompt disease diagnosis and treatment planning, reducing severe symptom mortality rates, and optimizing the allocation of medical resources.|Weiwei Tian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02608)|null|
|**2024-08-30**|**Medical Report Generation Is A Multi-label Classification Problem**|Medical report generation is a critical task in healthcare that involves the automatic creation of detailed and accurate descriptions from medical images. Traditionally, this task has been approached as a sequence generation problem, relying on vision-and-language techniques to generate coherent and contextually relevant reports. However, in this paper, we propose a novel perspective: rethinking medical report generation as a multi-label classification problem. By framing the task this way, we leverage the radiology nodes from the commonly used knowledge graph, which can be better captured through classification techniques. To verify our argument, we introduce a novel report generation framework based on BLIP integrated with classified key nodes, which allows for effective report generation with accurate classification of multiple key aspects within the medical images. This approach not only simplifies the report generation process but also significantly enhances performance metrics. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that leveraging key nodes can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, surpassing existing approaches across two benchmark datasets. The results underscore the potential of re-envisioning traditional tasks with innovative methodologies, paving the way for more efficient and accurate medical report generation.|Yijian Fan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00250)|null|

In chest X-ray (CXR) analysis, previous studies have employed LLMs, but with limitations: either underutilizing the multi-tasking capabilities of LLMs or lacking clinical accuracy. This paper presents M4CXR, a multi-modal LLM designed to enhance CXR interpretation. The model is trained on a visual instruction-following dataset that integrates various task-specific datasets in a conversational format. As a result, the model supports multiple tasks such as medical report generation (MRG), visual grounding, and visual question answering (VQA). M4CXR achieves state-of-the-art clinical accuracy in MRG by employing a chain-of-thought prompting strategy, in which it identifies findings in CXR images and subsequently generates corresponding reports. The model is adaptable to various MRG scenarios depending on the available inputs, such as single-image, multi-image, and multi-study contexts. In addition to MRG, M4CXR performs visual grounding at a level comparable to specialized models and also demonstrates outstanding performance in VQA. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments reveal M4CXR's versatility in MRG, visual grounding, and VQA, while consistently maintaining clinical accuracy.|Jonggwon Park et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16213)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**ReXamine-Global: A Framework for Uncovering Inconsistencies in Radiology Report Generation Metrics**|Given the rapidly expanding capabilities of generative AI models for radiology, there is a need for robust metrics that can accurately measure the quality of AI-generated radiology reports across diverse hospitals. We develop ReXamine-Global, a LLM-powered, multi-site framework that tests metrics across different writing styles and patient populations, exposing gaps in their generalization. First, our method tests whether a metric is undesirably sensitive to reporting style, providing different scores depending on whether AI-generated reports are stylistically similar to ground-truth reports or not. Second, our method measures whether a metric reliably agrees with experts, or whether metric and expert scores of AI-generated report quality diverge for some sites. Using 240 reports from 6 hospitals around the world, we apply ReXamine-Global to 7 established report evaluation metrics and uncover serious gaps in their generalizability. Developers can apply ReXamine-Global when designing new report evaluation metrics, ensuring their robustness across sites. Additionally, our analysis of existing metrics can guide users of those metrics towards evaluation procedures that work reliably at their sites of interest.|Oishi Banerjee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16208)|null|

However, existing evaluation methods fail to reveal the models' understanding of radiological images and their capacity to achieve human-level granularity in descriptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a system, named ReXKG, which extracts structured information from processed reports to construct a comprehensive radiology knowledge graph. We then propose three metrics to evaluate the similarity of nodes (ReXKG-NSC), distribution of edges (ReXKG-AMS), and coverage of subgraphs (ReXKG-SCS) across various knowledge graphs. We conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of AI-generated and human-written radiology reports, assessing the performance of both specialist and generalist models.

|**2024-08-22**|**TRRG: Towards Truthful Radiology Report Generation With Cross-modal Disease Clue Enhanced Large Language Model**|The vision-language modeling capability of multi-modal large language models has attracted wide attention from the community. However, in medical domain, radiology report generation using vision-language models still faces significant challenges due to the imbalanced data distribution caused by numerous negated descriptions in radiology reports and issues such as rough alignment between radiology reports and radiography. In this paper, we propose a truthful radiology report generation framework, namely TRRG, based on stage-wise training for cross-modal disease clue injection into large language models. In pre-training stage, During the pre-training phase, contrastive learning is employed to enhance the ability of visual encoder to perceive fine-grained disease details. In fine-tuning stage, the clue injection module we proposed significantly enhances the disease-oriented perception capability of the large language model by effectively incorporating the robust zero-shot disease perception. Finally, through the cross-modal clue interaction module, our model effectively achieves the multi-granular interaction of visual embeddings and an arbitrary number of disease clue embeddings. This significantly enhances the report generation capability and clinical effectiveness of multi-modal large language models in the field of radiology reportgeneration. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed pre-training and fine-tuning framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in radiology report generation on datasets such as IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR. Further analysis indicates that our proposed method can effectively enhance the model to perceive diseases and improve its clinical effectiveness.|Yuhao Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12141)|null|

We also highlight limitations in evaluating radiology report generation using only the standard language generation metrics. We then applied a transformer based radiology report generation architecture, and also compare the performance of a transformer based decoder with the recurrence based decoder. Experiments were performed using the IU-CXR dataset, showing superior results to its LSTM counterpart and being significantly faster. Finally, we identify the need of evaluating radiology report generation system using both language generation metrics and classification metrics, which helps to provide robust measure of generated reports in terms of their coherence and diagnostic value.|Sonit Singh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11344)|null|
|**2024-08-21**|**BURExtract-Llama: An LLM for Clinical Concept Extraction in Breast Ultrasound Reports**|Breast ultrasound is essential for detecting and diagnosing abnormalities, with radiology reports summarizing key findings like lesion characteristics and malignancy assessments. Extracting this critical information is challenging due to the unstructured nature of these reports, with varied linguistic styles and inconsistent formatting. While proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 are effective, they are costly and raise privacy concerns when handling protected health information. This study presents a pipeline for developing an in-house LLM to extract clinical information from radiology reports. We first use GPT-4 to create a small labeled dataset, then fine-tune a Llama3-8B model on it. Evaluated on clinician-annotated reports, our model achieves an average F1 score of 84.6%, which is on par with GPT-4. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing an in-house LLM that not only matches GPT-4's performance but also offers cost reductions and enhanced data privacy.|Yuxuan Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11334)|null|
|**2024-08-19**|**R2GenCSR: Retrieving Context Samples for Large Language Model based X-ray Medical Report Generation**|Inspired by the tremendous success of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing X-ray medical report generation methods attempt to leverage large models to achieve better performance. They usually adopt a Transformer to extract the visual features of a given X-ray image, and then, feed them into the LLM for text generation. How to extract more effective information for the LLMs to help them improve final results is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Additionally, the use of visual Transformer models also brings high computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel context-guided efficient X-ray medical report generation framework. Specifically, we introduce the Mamba as the vision backbone with linear complexity, and the performance obtained is comparable to that of the strong Transformer model. More importantly, we perform context retrieval from the training set for samples within each mini-batch during the training phase, utilizing both positively and negatively related samples to enhance feature representation and discriminative learning. Subsequently, we feed the vision tokens, context information, and prompt statements to invoke the LLM for generating high-quality medical reports. Extensive experiments on three X-ray report generation datasets (i.e., IU-Xray, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert Plus) fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed model.

Accurate and timely identification of VTE is essential for effective medical care. This study builds upon our previous work, which addressed VTE detection using deep learning methods for DVT and a hybrid approach combining deep learning and rule-based classification for PE. Our earlier approaches, while effective, had two major limitations: they were complex and required expert involvement for feature engineering of the rule set. To overcome these challenges, we utilize the Mamba architecture-based classifier. This model achieves remarkable results, with a 97\% accuracy and F1 score on the DVT dataset and a 98\% accuracy and F1 score on the PE dataset. In contrast to the previous hybrid method on PE identification, the Mamba classifier eliminates the need for hand-engineered rules, significantly reducing model complexity while maintaining comparable performance. Additionally, we evaluated a lightweight Large Language Model (LLM), Phi-3 Mini, in detecting VTE. While this model delivers competitive results, outperforming the baseline BERT models, it proves to be computationally intensive due to its larger parameter set. Our evaluation shows that the Mamba-based model demonstrates superior performance and efficiency in VTE identification, offering an effective solution to the limitations of previous approaches.|Jamie Deng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09043)|null|

However, general MLLMs perform poorly in cardiac disease diagnosis, particularly in the integration of ECG data analysis and long-text medical report generation, mainly due to the complexity of ECG data analysis and the gap between text and ECG signal modalities. Additionally, models often exhibit severe stability deficiencies in long-text generation due to the lack of precise knowledge strongly related to user queries. To address these issues, we propose ECG-Chat, the first multitask MLLMs focused on ECG medical report generation, providing multimodal conversational capabilities based on cardiology knowledge. We propose a contrastive learning approach that integrates ECG waveform data with text reports, aligning ECG features with reports in a fine-grained manner. This method also results in an ECG encoder that excels in zero-shot report retrieval tasks. Additionally, expanding existing datasets, we constructed a 19k ECG diagnosis dataset and a 25k multi-turn dialogue dataset for training and fine-tuning ECG-Chat, which provides professional diagnostic and conversational capabilities. Furthermore, ECG-Chat can generate comprehensive ECG analysis reports through an automated LaTeX generation pipeline. We established a benchmark for the ECG report generation task and tested our model on multiple baselines. ECG-Chat achieved the best performance in classification, retrieval, multimodal dialogue, and medical report generation tasks. Our report template design has also been widely recognized by medical practitioners.|Yubao Zhao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08849)|null|

|**2025-01-10**|**LlamaV-o1: Rethinking Step-by-step Visual Reasoning in LLMs**|Reasoning is a fundamental capability for solving complex multi-step problems, particularly in visual contexts where sequential step-wise understanding is essential. Existing approaches lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating visual reasoning and do not emphasize step-wise problem-solving. To this end, we propose a comprehensive framework for advancing step-by-step visual reasoning in large language models (LMMs) through three key contributions. First, we introduce a visual reasoning benchmark specifically designed to evaluate multi-step reasoning tasks. The benchmark presents a diverse set of challenges with eight different categories ranging from complex visual perception to scientific reasoning with over 4k reasoning steps in total, enabling robust evaluation of LLMs' abilities to perform accurate and interpretable visual reasoning across multiple steps. Second, we propose a novel metric that assesses visual reasoning quality at the granularity of individual steps, emphasizing both correctness and logical coherence. The proposed metric offers deeper insights into reasoning performance compared to traditional end-task accuracy metrics. Third, we present a new multimodal visual reasoning model, named LlamaV-o1, trained using a multi-step curriculum learning approach, where tasks are progressively organized to facilitate incremental skill acquisition and problem-solving. The proposed LlamaV-o1 is designed for multi-step reasoning and learns step-by-step through a structured training paradigm. Extensive experiments show that our LlamaV-o1 outperforms existing open-source models and performs favorably against close-source proprietary models. Compared to the recent Llava-CoT, our LlamaV-o1 achieves an average score of 67.3 with an absolute gain of 3.8\% across six benchmarks while being 5 times faster during inference scaling. Our benchmark, model, and code are publicly available.|Omkar Thawakar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06186)|**[link](https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/llamav-o1)**|

These maps are indispensable in various fields, including disaster detection, resource exploration, and civil engineering. Despite their significance, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often fall short in geologic map understanding. This gap is primarily due to the challenging nature of cartographic generalization, which involves handling high-resolution map, managing multiple associated components, and requiring domain-specific knowledge. To quantify this gap, we construct GeoMap-Bench, the first-ever benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in geologic map understanding, which assesses the full-scale abilities in extracting, referring, grounding, reasoning, and analyzing. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeoMap-Agent, the inaugural agent designed for geologic map understanding, which features three modules: Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI), and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). Inspired by the interdisciplinary collaboration among human scientists, an AI expert group acts as consultants, utilizing a diverse tool pool to comprehensively analyze questions. Through comprehensive experiments, GeoMap-Agent achieves an overall score of 0.811 on GeoMap-Bench, significantly outperforming 0.369 of GPT-4o.

|**2025-01-10**|**Multilingual Performance of a Multimodal Artificial Intelligence System on Multisubject Physics Concept Inventories**|We investigate the multilingual and multimodal performance of a large language model-based artificial intelligence (AI) system, GPT-4o, on a diverse set of physics concept inventories spanning multiple languages and subject areas. The inventories taken from the PhysPort website cover the classical physics topics of mechanics, electromagnetism, optics, and thermodynamics as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, astronomy, mathematics, and laboratory skills. Unlike previous text-only studies, we uploaded the inventories as images mirroring what a student would see on paper, assessing the system's multimodal functionality. The AI is prompted in English and autonomously chooses the language of its response - either remaining in the nominal language of the test, switching entirely to English, or mixing languages - revealing adaptive behavior dependent on linguistic complexity and data availability. Our results indicate some variation in performance across subject areas, with laboratory skills standing out as the area of poorest performance. Furthermore, the AI's performance on questions that require visual interpretation of images is worse than on purely text-based questions. Questions that are difficult for the AI tend to be that way invariably of the inventory language. We also find large variations in performance across languages, with some appearing to benefit substantially from language switching, a phenomenon similar to code-switching ofhuman speakers. Overall, comparing the obtained AI results to the existing literature, we find that the AI system outperforms average undergraduate students post-instruction in all subject areas but laboratory skills.|Gerd Kortemeyer et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06143)|null|
|**2025-01-10**|**Supervision policies can shape long-term risk management in general-purpose AI models**|The rapid proliferation and deployment of General-Purpose AI (GPAI) models, including large language models (LLMs), present unprecedented challenges for AI supervisory entities. We hypothesize that these entities will need to navigate an emergent ecosystem of risk and incident reporting, likely to exceed their supervision capacity. To investigate this, we develop a simulation framework parameterized by features extracted from the diverse landscape of risk, incident, or hazard reporting ecosystems, including community-driven platforms, crowdsourcing initiatives, and expert assessments. We evaluate four supervision policies: non-prioritized (first-come, first-served), random selection, priority-based (addressing the highest-priority risks first), and diversity-prioritized (balancing high-priority risks with comprehensive coverage across risk types). Our results indicate that while priority-based and diversity-prioritized policies are more effective at mitigating high-impact risks, particularly those identified by experts, they may inadvertently neglect systemic issues reported by the broader community. This oversight can create feedback loops that amplify certain types of reporting while discouraging others, leading to a skewed perception of the overall risk landscape. We validate our simulation results with several real-world datasets, including one with over a million ChatGPT interactions, of which more than 150,000 conversations were identified as risky. This validation underscores the complex trade-offs inherent in AI risk supervision and highlights how the choice of risk management policies can shape the future landscape of AI risks across diverse GPAI models used in society.|Manuel Cebrian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06137)|**[link](https://github.com/manuelcebrianramos/llm_supervision_policies)**|

Existing ASR correction methods rely on prior user data or named entities. We extend correction to tasks that have no prior user data and exhibit linguistic flexibility such as lexical and syntactic variations. We propose a novel context augmentation with a large language model and a ranking strategy that incorporates contextual information from the dialogue states of a goal-oriented conversational AI and its tasks. Our method ranks (1) n-best ASR hypotheses by their lexical and semantic similarity with context and (2) context by phonetic correspondence with ASR hypotheses. Evaluated in home improvement and cooking domains with real-world users, our method improves recall and F1 of correction by 34% and 16%, respectively, while maintaining precision and false positive rate. Users rated .8-1 point (out of 5) higher when our correction method worked properly, with no decrease due to false positives.|Yuya Asano et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06129)|null|
|**2025-01-10**|**Fleurs-SLU: A Massively Multilingual Benchmark for Spoken Language Understanding**|While recent multilingual automatic speech recognition models claim to support thousands of languages, ASR for low-resource languages remains highly unreliable due to limited bimodal speech and text training data. Better multilingual spoken language understanding (SLU) can strengthen massively the robustness of multilingual ASR by levering language semantics to compensate for scarce training data, such as disambiguating utterances via context or exploiting semantic similarities across languages. Even more so, SLU is indispensable for inclusive speech technology in roughly half of all living languages that lack a formal writing system. However, the evaluation of multilingual SLU remains limited to shallower tasks such as intent classification or language identification. To address this, we present Fleurs-SLU, a multilingual SLU benchmark that encompasses topical speech classification in 102 languages and multiple-choice question answering through listening comprehension in 92 languages. We extensively evaluate both end-to-end speech classification models and cascaded systems that combine speech-to-text transcription with subsequent classification by large language models on Fleurs-SLU. Our results show that cascaded systems exhibit greater robustness in multilingual SLU tasks, though speech encoders can achieve competitive performance in topical speech classification when appropriately pre-trained. We further find a strong correlation between robust multilingual ASR, effective speech-to-text translation, and strong multilingual SLU, highlighting the mutual benefits between acoustic and semantic speech representations.|Fabian David Schmidt et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06117)|null|

As mental health care increasingly integrates technologies like chatbots and large language models (LLMs), understanding how PST can be effectively automated is important. This study leverages anonymized therapy transcripts to analyze and classify therapeutic interventions using various LLMs and transformer-based models. Our results show that GPT-4o achieved the highest accuracy (0.76) in identifying PST strategies, outperforming other models. Additionally, we introduced a new dimension of communication strategies that enhances the current PST framework, offering deeper insights into therapist-client interactions. This research demonstrates the potential of LLMs to automate complex therapeutic dialogue analysis, providing a scalable, efficient tool for mental health interventions. Our annotation framework can enhance the accessibility, effectiveness, and personalization of PST, supporting therapists in real-time with more precise, targeted interventions.|Elham Aghakhani et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06101)|null|
|**2025-01-10**|**Addressing speaker gender bias in large scale speech translation systems**|This study addresses the issue of speaker gender bias in Speech Translation (ST) systems, which can lead to offensive and inaccurate translations. The masculine bias often found in large-scale ST systems is typically perpetuated through training data derived from Machine Translation (MT) systems. Our approach involves two key steps. First, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to rectify translations based on the speaker's gender in a cost-effective manner. Second, we fine-tune the ST model with the corrected data, enabling the model to generate gender-specific translations directly from audio cues, without the need for explicit gender input. Additionally, we propose a three-mode fine-tuned model for scenarios where the speaker's gender is either predefined or should not be inferred from speech cues. We demonstrate a 70% improvement in translations for female speakers compared to our baseline and other large-scale ST systems, such as Seamless M4T and Canary, on the MuST-SHE test set.|Shubham Bansal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05989)|null|

To address these challenges, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to automate the questionnaire pretesting process in cross-cultural settings. Our study used LLMs to adapt a U.S.-focused climate opinion survey for a South African audience. We then tested the adapted questionnaire with 116 South African participants via Prolific, asking them to provide feedback on both versions. Participants perceived the LLM-adapted questions as slightly more favorable than the traditional version.

Most existing solutions address this challenge by focusing on aligning the models with credible sources or by improving how models communicate their confidence (or lack thereof) in their outputs. While these measures may be effective in most contexts, they may fall short in scenarios requiring more nuanced approaches, especially in situations where access to accurate data is limited or determining credible sources is challenging. In this study, we take North Korea - a country characterised by an extreme lack of reliable sources and the prevalence of sensationalist falsehoods - as a case study. We explore and evaluate how some of the best-performing multilingual LLMs and specific language-based models generate information about North Korea in three languages spoken in countries with significant geo-political interests: English (United States, United Kingdom), Korean (South Korea), and Mandarin Chinese (China). Our findings reveal significant differences, suggesting that the choice of model and language can lead to vastly different understandings of North Korea, which has important implications given the global security challenges the country poses.|Eunjung Cho et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05981)|null|
|**2025-01-09**|**ReFocus: Visual Editing as a Chain of Thought for Structured Image Understanding**|Structured image understanding, such as interpreting tables and charts, requires strategically refocusing across various structures and texts within an image, forming a reasoning sequence to arrive at the final answer. However, current multimodal large language models (LLMs) lack this multihop selective attention capability. In this work, we introduce ReFocus, a simple yet effective framework that equips multimodal LLMs with the ability to generate "visual thoughts" by performing visual editing on the input image through code, shifting and refining their visual focuses. Specifically, ReFocus enables multimodal LLMs to generate Python codes to call tools and modify the input image, sequentially drawing boxes, highlighting sections, and masking out areas, thereby enhancing the visual reasoning process. We experiment upon a wide range of structured image understanding tasks involving tables and charts. ReFocus largely improves performance on all tasks over GPT-4o without visual editing, yielding an average gain of 11.0% on table tasks and 6.8% on chart tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of the effects of different visual edits, and reasons why ReFocus can improve the performance without introducing additional information. Further, we collect a 14k training set using ReFocus, and prove that such visual chain-of-thought with intermediate information offers a better supervision than standard VQA data, reaching a 8.0% average gain over the same model trained with QA pairs and 2.6% over CoT.|Xingyu Fu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05452)|null|

EMMA: An Enhanced MultiModal ReAsoning Benchmark**|The ability to organically reason over and with both text and images is a pillar of human intelligence, yet the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform such multimodal reasoning remains under-explored. Existing benchmarks often emphasize text-dominant reasoning or rely on shallow visual cues, failing to adequately assess integrated visual and textual reasoning. We introduce EMMA (Enhanced MultiModal reAsoning), a benchmark targeting organic multimodal reasoning across mathematics, physics, chemistry, and coding. EMMA tasks demand advanced cross-modal reasoning that cannot be addressed by reasoning independently in each modality, offering an enhanced test suite for MLLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on EMMA reveals significant limitations in handling complex multimodal and multi-step reasoning tasks, even with advanced techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time compute scaling underperforming. These findings underscore the need for improved multimodal architectures and training paradigms to close the gap between human and model reasoning in multimodality.|Yunzhuo Hao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05444)|null|

This abuse manifests in multiple ways, including hate speech, cyberbullying, emotional abuse, grooming, and sexting. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the different forms of abuse prevalent in social media, with a particular focus on how emerging technologies, such as Language Models (LMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), are reshaping both the detection and generation of abusive content within these networks. We delve into the mechanisms through which social media abuse is perpetuated, exploring the psychological and social impact. Additionally, we examine the dual role of advanced language models-highlighting their potential to enhance automated detection systems for abusive behavior while also acknowledging their capacity to generate harmful content.

However, research on bias in code generation remains limited. Existing studies typically assess bias by applying malicious prompts or reapply tasks and dataset for discriminative models. Given that LLMs are often aligned with human values and that prior datasets are not fully optimized for code-related tasks, there is a pressing need for benchmarks specifically designed for evaluating code models. In this study, we introduce FairCode, a novel benchmark for evaluating bias in code generation. FairCode comprises two tasks: function implementation and test case generation, each evaluating social bias through diverse scenarios. Additionally, we propose a new metric, FairScore, to assess model performance on this benchmark. We conduct experiments on widely used LLMs and provide a comprehensive analysis of the results.

These models, based on foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) - trained on broad data - are tailored to address the demands of physics research. LPMs can function independently or as part of an integrated framework. This framework can incorporate specialized tools, including symbolic reasoning modules for mathematical manipulations, frameworks to analyse specific experimental and simulated data, and mechanisms for synthesizing theories and scientific literature. We begin by examining whether the physics community should actively develop and refine dedicated models, rather than relying solely on commercial LLMs. We then outline how LPMs can be realized through interdisciplinary collaboration among experts in physics, computer science, and philosophy of science. To integrate these models effectively, we identify three key pillars: Development, Evaluation, and Philosophical Reflection. Development focuses on constructing models capable of processing physics texts, mathematical formulations, and diverse physical data. Evaluation assesses accuracy and reliability by testing and benchmarking. Finally, Philosophical Reflection encompasses the analysis of broader implications of LLMs in physics, including their potential to generate new scientific understanding and what novel collaboration dynamics might arise in research. Inspired by the organizational structure of experimental collaborations in particle physics, we propose a similarly interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to building and refining Large Physics Models. This roadmap provides specific objectives, defines pathways to achieve them, and identifies challenges that must be addressed to realise physics-specific large scale AI models.|Kristian G.

While speculative sampling was previously limited to discrete sequences, we extend it to diffusion models, which generate samples via continuous, vector-valued Markov chains. In this context, the target model is a high-quality but computationally expensive diffusion model. We propose various drafting strategies, including a simple and effective approach that does not require training a draft model and is applicable out of the box to any diffusion model. Our experiments demonstrate significant generation speedup on various diffusion models, halving the number of function evaluations, while generating exact samples from the target model.|Valentin De Bortoli et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05370)|null|

However, their extended reasoning processes often suffer from knowledge insufficiency, leading to frequent uncertainties and potential errors. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{Search-o1}, a framework that enhances LRMs with an agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism and a Reason-in-Documents module for refining retrieved documents. Search-o1 integrates an agentic search workflow into the reasoning process, enabling dynamic retrieval of external knowledge when LRMs encounter uncertain knowledge points. Additionally, due to the verbose nature of retrieved documents, we design a separate Reason-in-Documents module to deeply analyze the retrieved information before injecting it into the reasoning chain, minimizing noise and preserving coherent reasoning flow. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks in science, mathematics, and coding, as well as six open-domain QA benchmarks, demonstrate the strong performance of Search-o1. This approach enhances the trustworthiness and applicability of LRMs in complex reasoning tasks, paving the way for more reliable and versatile intelligent systems.

Current alignment strategies, including adaptive training and inference-time methods, have demonstrated potential in this area. However, these approaches still struggle to balance deployment complexity and capability across various tasks and difficulties. In this work, we introduce the Streaming Distribution Induce Aligner (Stream Aligner), a novel alignment paradigm that combines efficiency with enhanced performance in various tasks throughout the generation process. Stream Aligner achieves dynamic sentence-level correction by using a small model to learn the preferences of the suffix sentence, iteratively correcting the suffix sentence output by the upstream model, and then using the corrected sentence to replace the suffix sentence in subsequent generations. Compared to Aligner, our experiments demonstrate that Stream Aligner reduces reliance on the capabilities of additional models, enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs, and decreases latency during user interaction. Specifically, Stream Aligner-2B model has achieved an improvement of 76.1% in helpfulness, 36.0% in harmlessness on the tested Llama2-70B-chat model, and Stream Aligner-8B has achieved an improvement of 3.5% on the math ability of the tested Llama3-70B-Instruct model.|Hantao Lou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05336)|**[link](https://github.com/htlou/stream-aligner)**|

Studies emphasize the need for interpreting the behavior of these vehicles to passengers to promote trust in autonomous systems. Interpreters can enhance trust by improving transparency and reducing perceived risk. However, current solutions often lack a human-centric approach to integrating multimodal interpretations. This paper introduces a novel Human-centered Multimodal Interpreter (HMI) system that leverages human preferences to provide visual, textual, and auditory feedback. The system combines a visual interface with Bird's Eye View (BEV), map, and text display, along with voice interaction using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). Our user study, involving diverse participants, demonstrated that the HMI system significantly boosts passenger trust in AVs, increasing average trust levels by over 8%, with trust in ordinary environments rising by up to 30%. These results underscore the potential of the HMI system to improve the acceptance and reliability of autonomous vehicles by providing clear, real-time, and context-sensitive explanations of vehicle actions.|Xuewen Luo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05322)|null|
|**2025-01-08**|**Re-ranking the Context for Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation**|Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge to generate a response within a context with improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations. However, multi-modal RAG systems face unique challenges: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant entries to user query (e.g., images, documents), and (ii) vision-language models or multi-modal language models like GPT-4o may hallucinate when processing these entries to generate RAG output. In this paper, we aim to address the first challenge, i.e, improving the selection of relevant context from the knowledge-base in retrieval phase of the multi-modal RAG. Specifically, we leverage the relevancy score (RS) measure designed in our previous work for evaluating the RAG performance to select more relevant entries in retrieval process. The retrieval based on embeddings, say CLIP-based embedding, and cosine similarity usually perform poorly particularly for multi-modal data. We show that by using a more advanced relevancy measure, one can enhance the retrieval process by selecting more relevant pieces from the knowledge-base and eliminate the irrelevant pieces from the context by adaptively selecting up-to- $k$ entries instead of fixed number of entries. Our evaluation using COCO dataset demonstrates significant enhancement in selecting relevant context and accuracy of the generated response.|Matin Mortaheb et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04695)|null|
|**2025-01-08**|**EpiCoder: Encompassing Diversity and Complexity in Code Generation**|Effective instruction tuning is indispensable for optimizing code LLMs, aligning model behavior with user expectations and enhancing model performance in real-world applications. However, most existing methods focus on code snippets, which are limited to specific functionalities and rigid structures, restricting the complexity and diversity of the synthesized data. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel feature tree-based synthesis framework inspired by Abstract Syntax Trees (AST). Unlike AST, which captures syntactic structure of code, our framework models semantic relationships between code elements, enabling the generation of more nuanced and diverse data. The feature tree is constructed from raw data and refined iteratively to increase the quantity and diversity of the extracted features. This process enables the identification of more complex patterns and relationships within the code. By sampling subtrees with controlled depth and breadth, our framework allows precise adjustments to the complexity of the generated code, supporting a wide range of tasks from simple function-level operations to intricate multi-file scenarios. We fine-tuned widely-used base models to create the EpiCoder series, achieving state-of-the-art performance at both the function and file levels across multiple benchmarks. Notably, empirical evidence indicates that our approach shows significant potential in synthesizing highly complex repository-level code data. Further analysis elucidates the merits of this approach by rigorously assessing data complexity and diversity through software engineering principles and LLM-as-a-judge method.|Yaoxiang Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04694)|null|
|**2025-01-08**|**URSA: Understanding and Verifying Chain-of-thought Reasoning in Multimodal Mathematics**|Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely applied in the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, the introduction of derivative process supervision on CoT trajectories has sparked discussions on enhancing scaling capabilities during test time, thereby boosting the potential of these models. However, in multimodal mathematical reasoning, the scarcity of high-quality CoT training data has hindered existing models from achieving high-precision CoT reasoning and has limited the realization of reasoning potential during test time. In this work, we propose a three-module synthesis strategy that integrates CoT distillation, trajectory-format rewriting, and format unification. It results in a high-quality CoT reasoning instruction fine-tuning dataset in multimodal mathematics, MMathCoT-1M. We comprehensively validate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of the trained URSA-7B model on multiple multimodal mathematical benchmarks. For test-time scaling, we introduce a data synthesis strategy that automatically generates process annotation datasets, known as DualMath-1.1M, focusing on both interpretation and logic. By further training URSA-7B on DualMath-1.1M, we transition from CoT reasoning capabilities to robust supervision abilities. The trained URSA-RM-7B acts as a verifier, effectively enhancing the performance of URSA-7B at test time. URSA-RM-7B also demonstrates excellent out-of-distribution (OOD) verifying capabilities, showcasing its generalization.

The dataset comprises simple, stacked, and grouped bar charts, targeting the unique structural features of these visualizations. The finetuned DEPLOT model is evaluated against its base version using a test set of 1,000 images and two metrics: Relative Mapping Similarity (RMS), which measures categorical mapping accuracy, and Relative Number Set Similarity (RNSS), which evaluates numerical interpretation accuracy.

Exploring Visual Correspondence Shortcomings of Multimodal LLMs**|Recent advancements in multimodal models have shown a strong ability in visual perception, reasoning abilities, and vision-language understanding. However, studies on visual matching ability are missing, where finding the visual correspondence of objects is essential in vision research. Our research reveals that the matching capabilities in recent multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) still exhibit systematic shortcomings, even with current strong MLLMs models, GPT-4o. In particular, we construct a Multimodal Visual Matching (MMVM) benchmark to fairly benchmark over 30 different MLLMs. The MMVM benchmark is built from 15 open-source datasets and Internet videos with manual annotation. We categorize the data samples of MMVM benchmark into eight aspects based on the required cues and capabilities to more comprehensively evaluate and analyze current MLLMs. In addition, we have designed an automatic annotation pipeline to generate the MMVM SFT dataset, including 220K visual matching data with reasoning annotation. Finally, we present CoLVA, a novel contrastive MLLM with two novel technical designs: fine-grained vision expert with object-level contrastive learning and instruction augmentation strategy. CoLVA achieves 51.06\% overall accuracy (OA) on the MMVM benchmark, surpassing GPT-4o and baseline by 8.41\% and 23.58\% OA, respectively.

Evaluating their true `understanding' of language is particularly challenging due to the extensive web-scale data they are trained on. Therefore, we construct an evaluation to systematically assess natural language understanding (NLU) in LLMs by leveraging Construction Grammar (CxG), which provides insights into the meaning captured by linguistic elements known as constructions (Cxns). CxG is well-suited for this purpose because provides a theoretical basis to construct targeted evaluation sets. These datasets are carefully constructed to include examples which are unlikely to appear in pre-training data, yet intuitive and easy for humans to understand, enabling a more targeted and reliable assessment. Our experiments focus on downstream natural language inference and reasoning tasks by comparing LLMs' understanding of the underlying meanings communicated through 8 unique Cxns with that of humans. The results show that while LLMs demonstrate some knowledge of constructional information, even the latest models including GPT-o1 struggle with abstract meanings conveyed by these Cxns, as demonstrated in cases where test sentences are dissimilar to their pre-training data. We argue that such cases provide a more accurate test of true language understanding, highlighting key limitations in LLMs' semantic capabilities.

However, when building real-world RAG applications, practical issues arise. First, the retrieved information is generally domain-specific. Since it is computationally expensive to fine-tune LLMs, it is more feasible to fine-tune the retriever to improve the quality of the data included in the LLM input. Second, as more applications are deployed in the same real-world system, one cannot afford to deploy separate retrievers. Moreover, these RAG applications normally retrieve different kinds of data. Our solution is to instruction fine-tune a small retriever encoder on a variety of domain-specific tasks to allow us to deploy one encoder that can serve many use cases, thereby achieving low-cost, scalability, and speed. We show how this encoder generalizes to out-of-domain settings as well as to an unseen retrieval task on real-world enterprise use cases.|Patrice Béchard et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04652)|null|

This task is particularly challenging, as a successful design must not only incorporate all the necessary objects in a cohesive style, but also ensure they are arranged in a way that maximizes accessibility, while adhering to a variety of affordability and usage considerations. Data-driven solutions have been proposed, but these are typically room- or domain-specific and lack explainability in their design design considerations used in producing the final layout. In this paper, we investigate if large language models (LLMs) can be directly utilized for interior design. While we find that LLMs are not yet capable of generating complete layouts, they can be effectively leveraged in a structured manner, inspired by the workflow of interior designers. By systematically probing LLMs, we can reliably generate a list of objects along with relevant constraints that guide their placement. We translate this information into a design layout graph, which is then solved using an off-the-shelf constrained optimization setup to generate the final layouts. We benchmark our algorithm in various design configurations against existing LLM-based methods and human designs, and evaluate the results using a variety of quantitative and qualitative metrics along with user studies. In summary, we demonstrate that LLMs, when used in a structured manner, can effectively generate diverse high-quality layouts, making them a viable solution for creating large-scale virtual scenes.

Using TTQA and TMMLU+ as evaluation datasets, the system employs BGE-M3 for dense vector retrieval to obtain highly relevant search results and BGE-reranker to reorder these results based on query relevance. The most pertinent retrieval outcomes serve as reference knowledge for a Large Language Model (LLM), enhancing its ability to answer questions and establishing a knowledge retrieval system grounded in generative AI.   The system's effectiveness is assessed through a two-stage evaluation: automatic and assisted performance evaluations. The automatic evaluation calculates accuracy by comparing the model's auto-generated labels with ground truth answers, measuring performance under standardized conditions without human intervention. The assisted performance evaluation involves 20 finance-related multiple-choice questions answered by 20 participants without financial backgrounds. Initially, participants answer independently. Later, they receive system-generated reference information to assist in answering, examining whether the system improves accuracy when assistance is provided.   The main contributions of this research are: (1) Enhanced LLM Capability: By integrating BGE-M3 and BGE-reranker, the system retrieves and reorders highly relevant results, reduces hallucinations, and dynamically accesses authorized or public knowledge sources. (2) Improved Data Privacy: A customized RAG architecture enables local operation of the LLM, eliminating the need to send private data to external servers. This approach enhances data security, reduces reliance on commercial services, lowers operational costs, and mitigates privacy risks.|Te-Lun Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04635)|null|

However, RAG, particularly multi-modal RAG, can introduce new hallucination sources: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant pieces (e.g., documents, images) as raw context from the database, and (ii) retrieved images are processed into text-based context via vision-language models (VLMs) or directly used by multi-modal language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o, which may hallucinate. To address this, we propose a novel framework to evaluate the reliability of multi-modal RAG using two performance measures: (i) the relevancy score (RS), assessing the relevance of retrieved entries to the query, and (ii) the correctness score (CS), evaluating the accuracy of the generated response. We train RS and CS models using a ChatGPT-derived database and human evaluator samples. Results show that both models achieve ~88% accuracy on test data. Additionally, we construct a 5000-sample human-annotated database evaluating the relevancy of retrieved pieces and the correctness of response statements.

Existing works neglect to measure the generalization of their methods to other prompt styles and different sizes of LLMs. To address this, we define a controlled experimental setting covering 12 LLMs and four prompt styles. We additionally investigate if incorporating the response agreement of multiple LLMs and an appropriate loss function can improve calibration performance. Concretely, we build Calib-n, a novel framework that trains an auxiliary model for confidence estimation that aggregates responses from multiple LLMs to capture inter-model agreement. To optimize calibration, we integrate focal and AUC surrogate losses alongside binary cross-entropy. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate that both response agreement and focal loss improve calibration from baselines. We find that few-shot prompts are the most effective for auxiliary model-based methods, and auxiliary models demonstrate robust calibration performance across accuracy variations, outperforming LLMs' internal probabilities and verbalized confidences. These insights deepen the understanding of influence factors in LLM calibration, supporting their reliable deployment in diverse applications.|Yuxi Xia et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03991)|null|

This paper investigates the alignment between state-of-the-art LLMs and human annotators in detecting elements of relevance within home environment scenarios. We created a set of twelve images depicting various domestic scenarios and enlisted fourteen annotators to identify the key element in each image. We then compared these human responses with outputs from five different LLMs, including GPT-4o and four LLaVA variants. Our findings reveal a varied degree of alignment, with LLaVA 34B showing the highest performance but still scoring low. However, an analysis of the results highlights the models' potential to detect value-laden elements in images, suggesting that with improved training and refined prompts, LLMs could enhance applications in social robotics, assistive technologies, and human-computer interaction by providing deeper insights and more contextually relevant responses.|Giulio Antonio Abbo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03957)|null|
|**2025-01-07**|**Localizing AI: Evaluating Open-Weight Language Models for Languages of Baltic States**|Although large language models (LLMs) have transformed our expectations of modern language technologies, concerns over data privacy often restrict the use of commercially available LLMs hosted outside of EU jurisdictions. This limits their application in governmental, defence, and other data-sensitive sectors. In this work, we evaluate the extent to which locally deployable open-weight LLMs support lesser-spoken languages such as Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian. We examine various size and precision variants of the top-performing multilingual open-weight models, Llama~3, Gemma~2, Phi, and NeMo, on machine translation, multiple-choice question answering, and free-form text generation. The results indicate that while certain models like Gemma~2 perform close to the top commercially available models, many LLMs struggle with these languages. Most surprisingly, however, we find that these models, while showing close to state-of-the-art translation performance, are still prone to lexical hallucinations with errors in at least 1 in 20 words for all open-weight multilingual LLMs.|Jurgita Kapočiūtė-Dzikienė et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03952)|null|
|**2025-01-07**|**Not all tokens are created equal: Perplexity Attention Weighted Networks for AI generated text detection**|The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.|Pablo Miralles-González et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03940)|null|

This study explores the potential of LLMs to revolutionize public transportation management within the context of San Antonio's transit system. Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs in natural language processing and data analysis, we investigate their capabilities to optimize route planning, reduce wait times, and provide personalized travel assistance. By utilizing the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) and other relevant data, this research aims to demonstrate how LLMs can potentially improve resource allocation, elevate passenger satisfaction, and inform data-driven decision-making in transit operations. A comparative analysis of different ChatGPT models was conducted to assess their ability to understand transportation information, retrieve relevant data, and provide comprehensive responses. Findings from this study suggest that while LLMs hold immense promise for public transit, careful engineering and fine-tuning are essential to realizing their full potential. San Antonio serves as a case study to inform the development of LLM-powered transit systems in other urban environments.|Ramya Jonnala et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03904)|null|
|**2025-01-07**|**LLaVA-Mini: Efficient Image and Video Large Multimodal Models with One Vision Token**|The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has sparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs. LMM frameworks typically encode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and integrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language models (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens (predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead. Previous efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM backbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token quantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal vision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while preserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision tokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early layers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text tokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to fuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the extreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token. LLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the understanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient manner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token instead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by 77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over 10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory.|Shaolei Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03895)|**[link](https://github.com/ictnlp/llava-mini)**|
|**2025-01-06**|**BoostStep: Boosting mathematical capability of Large Language Models via improved single-step reasoning**|Cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promising performance in solving complex math problems with a divide-and-conquer pipeline and the assistance of in-context learning (ICL) examples. However, their potential for improvement is limited by two critical problems within their ICL examples: granularity-mismatch and the ensuing negative-effect noise problem. Specifically, the LLMs are capable of the dividing process yet mostly failed by inaccurate reasoning within a few conquer steps, while the ICL examples retrieved in question-grained sometimes lack relevant steps for a specific challenging reasoning step. Further, this disconnect may hinder the correct reasoning due to its irrelevance. To this end, we focus on improving the reasoning quality within each step and present BoostStep. BoostStep aligns the granularity between the retrieving and reasoning on step grained, and provides highly related ICL examples for each reasoning step with a novel `first-try' strategy. BoostStep provides more relevant examples than the coarse question-grained strategy, enhancing the model reasoning quality within each step steadily. BoostStep is a general and robust reasoning-enhancing method that not only improves standalone reasoning performance but also integrates seamlessly with Monte Carlo Tree Search methods (MCTS) to refine both candidate generation and decision-making. Quantitatively, it improves GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Math-72B by 3.6\% and 2.0\% respectively on various mathematical benchmarks, and 7.5\% gain combined with MCTS.|Beichen Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03226)|**[link](https://github.com/beichenzbc/booststep)**|
|**2025-01-06**|**Dispider: Enabling Video LLMs with Active Real-Time Interaction via Disentangled Perception, Decision, and Reaction**|Active Real-time interaction with video LLMs introduces a new paradigm for human-computer interaction, where the model not only understands user intent but also responds while continuously processing streaming video on the fly. Unlike offline video LLMs, which analyze the entire video before answering questions, active real-time interaction requires three capabilities: 1) Perception: real-time video monitoring and interaction capturing. 2) Decision: raising proactive interaction in proper situations, 3) Reaction: continuous interaction with users. However, inherent conflicts exist among the desired capabilities. The Decision and Reaction require a contrary Perception scale and grain, and the autoregressive decoding blocks the real-time Perception and Decision during the Reaction. To unify the conflicted capabilities within a harmonious system, we present Dispider, a system that disentangles Perception, Decision, and Reaction. Dispider features a lightweight proactive streaming video processing module that tracks the video stream and identifies optimal moments for interaction. Once the interaction is triggered, an asynchronous interaction module provides detailed responses, while the processing module continues to monitor the video in the meantime. Our disentangled and asynchronous design ensures timely, contextually accurate, and computationally efficient responses, making Dispider ideal for active real-time interaction for long-duration video streams. Experiments show that Dispider not only maintains strong performance in conventional video QA tasks, but also significantly surpasses previous online models in streaming scenario responses, thereby validating the effectiveness of our architecture.

In one case, issues arise when students heavily rely on such tools in a manner that can affect the development of their writing or coding skills. Other issues of plagiarism also apply. This study aims to support efforts to detect and identify textual content generated using LLM tools. We hypothesize that LLMs-generated text is detectable by machine learning (ML), and investigate ML models that can recognize and differentiate texts generated by multiple LLMs tools. We leverage several ML and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and utilized Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to understand the important features in attribution. Our method is divided into 1) binary classification to differentiate between human-written and AI-text, and 2) multi classification, to differentiate between human-written text and the text generated by the five different LLM tools (ChatGPT, LLaMA, Google Bard, Claude, and Perplexity). Results show high accuracy in the multi and binary classification. Our model outperformed GPTZero with 98.5\% accuracy to 78.3\%. Notably, GPTZero was unable to recognize about 4.2\% of the observations, but our model was able to recognize the complete test dataset. XAI results showed that understanding feature importance across different classes enables detailed author/source profiles.

The findings promote transparency and accountability, helping educators maintain ethical standards and supporting the responsible integration of AI in education. A key contribution of this work is the generation of the CyberHumanAI dataset, which has 1000 observations, 500 of which are written by humans and the other 500 produced by ChatGPT. We evaluate various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms on the CyberHumanAI dataset comparing human-written and AI-generated content from Large Language Models (LLMs) (i.e., ChatGPT). Results demonstrate that traditional ML algorithms, specifically XGBoost and Random Forest, achieve high performance (83% and 81% accuracies respectively). Results also show that classifying shorter content seems to be more challenging than classifying longer content. Further, using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) we identify discriminative features influencing the ML model's predictions, where human-written content tends to use a practical language (e.g., use and allow). Meanwhile AI-generated text is characterized by more abstract and formal terms (e.g., realm and employ). Finally, a comparative analysis with GPTZero show that our narrowly focused, simple, and fine-tuned model can outperform generalized systems like GPTZero. The proposed model achieved approximately 77.5% accuracy compared to GPTZero's 48.5% accuracy when tasked to classify Pure AI, Pure Human, and mixed class. GPTZero showed a tendency to classify challenging and small-content cases as either mixed or unrecognized while our proposed model showed a more balanced performance across the three classes.|Ayat A.

|**2025-01-06**|**The FACTS Grounding Leaderboard: Benchmarking LLMs' Ability to Ground Responses to Long-Form Input**|We introduce FACTS Grounding, an online leaderboard and associated benchmark that evaluates language models' ability to generate text that is factually accurate with respect to given context in the user prompt. In our benchmark, each prompt includes a user request and a full document, with a maximum length of 32k tokens, requiring long-form responses. The long-form responses are required to be fully grounded in the provided context document while fulfilling the user request. Models are evaluated using automated judge models in two phases: (1) responses are disqualified if they do not fulfill the user request; (2) they are judged as accurate if the response is fully grounded in the provided document. The automated judge models were comprehensively evaluated against a held-out test-set to pick the best prompt template, and the final factuality score is an aggregate of multiple judge models to mitigate evaluation bias. The FACTS Grounding leaderboard will be actively maintained over time, and contains both public and private splits to allow for external participation while guarding the integrity of the leaderboard.

To address these challenges, we propose CLIX, the task of Cross-Lingual explanations of Idiomatic eXpressions. We explore the capabilities of current NLP models for this task, and observe that while it remains challenging, large language models show promise.

However, the reverse process, translating code into natural language, termed semantic captioning, has received less attention. This task is becoming increasingly important as LLMs are integrated into platforms for code generation, security analysis, and educational purposes. In this paper, we focus on the captioning of SQL query (SQL2Text) to address the critical need for understanding and explaining SQL queries in an era where LLM-generated code poses potential security risks. We repurpose Text2SQL datasets for SQL2Text by introducing an iterative ICL prompt using GPT-4o to generate multiple additional utterances, which enhances the robustness of the datasets for the reverse task. We conduct our experiments using in-context learning (ICL) based on different sample selection methods, emphasizing smaller, more computationally efficient LLMs. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging the inherent graph properties of SQL for ICL sample selection significantly outperforms random selection by up to 39% on BLEU score and provides better results than alternative methods.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), in particular, learn from vast and diverse data sources, allowing rich and nuanced representations of the world and, thereby, providing extensive capabilities, including the ability to reason, engage in meaningful dialog; collaborate with humans and other agents to jointly solve complex problems; and understand social and emotional aspects of humans. Despite this impressive feat, the cognitive abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs trained on large-scale datasets are still superficial and brittle. Consequently, generic LLMs are severely limited in their generalist capabilities. A number of foundational problems -- embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory -- are required to be addressed for LLMs to attain human-level general intelligence. These concepts are more aligned with human cognition and provide LLMs with inherent human-like cognitive properties that support the realization of physically-plausible, semantically meaningful, flexible and more generalizable knowledge and intelligence. In this work, we discuss the aforementioned foundational issues and survey state-of-the art approaches for implementing these concepts in LLMs. Specifically, we discuss how the principles of embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory can be leveraged toward the attainment of artificial general intelligence (AGI) in an organic manner.|Alhassan Mumuni et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03151)|null|

In this paper, we introduce VicSim (victim simulator), a novel model that addresses three key dimensions of user simulation: informational faithfulness, emotional dynamics, and language style (e.g., grammar usage). We pioneer the integration of scenario-based victim modeling with GAN-based training workflow and key-information-based prompting, aiming to enhance the realism of simulated victims. Our adversarial training approach teaches the discriminator to recognize grammar and emotional cues as reliable indicators of synthetic content.

Since language models are prone to various types of errors during the reasoning process, PRMs are required to possess nuanced capabilities for detecting various implicit error types in real-world scenarios. However, current benchmarks primarily focus on step correctness, failing to evaluate PRMs' performance systematically. To address this gap, we introduce PRMBench, a process-level benchmark specifically designed to assess the fine-grained error detection capabilities of PRMs. PRMBench comprises 6,216 carefully designed problems and 83,456 step-level labels, evaluating models across multiple dimensions, including simplicity, soundness, and sensitivity. In our experiments on 15 models, spanning both open-source PRMs and closed-source large language models prompted as critic models, we uncover significant weaknesses in current PRMs. These findings underscore the challenges inherent in process-level evaluation and highlight key directions for future research.

However, speech plays a crucial role in multimodal dialogue systems, and implementing high-performance in both vision and speech tasks remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental modality differences. In this paper, we propose a carefully designed multi-stage training methodology that progressively trains LLM to understand both visual and speech information, ultimately enabling fluent vision and speech interaction. Our approach not only preserves strong vision-language capacity, but also enables efficient speech-to-speech dialogue capabilities without separate ASR and TTS modules, significantly accelerating multimodal end-to-end response speed. By comparing our method against state-of-the-art counterparts across benchmarks for image, video, and speech tasks, we demonstrate that our model is equipped with both strong visual and speech capabilities, making near real-time vision and speech interaction.|Chaoyou Fu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01957)|**[link](https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/VITA)**|

Due to the diversification of internet platforms and the exponential growth of users and items, the importance of cold-start recommendation (CSR) is becoming increasingly evident. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success and possess strong capabilities in modeling user and item information, providing new potential for cold-start recommendations. However, the research community on CSR still lacks a comprehensive review and reflection in this field. Based on this, in this paper, we stand in the context of the era of large language models and provide a comprehensive review and discussion on the roadmap, related literature, and future directions of CSR. Specifically, we have conducted an exploration of the development path of how existing CSR utilizes information, from content features, graph relations, and domain information, to the world knowledge possessed by large language models, aiming to provide new insights for both the research and industrial communities on CSR.

|**2025-01-03**|**Virgo: A Preliminary Exploration on Reproducing o1-like MLLM**|Recently, slow-thinking reasoning systems, built upon large language models (LLMs), have garnered widespread attention by scaling the thinking time during inference. There is also growing interest in adapting this capability to multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Given that MLLMs handle more complex data semantics across different modalities, it is intuitively more challenging to implement multimodal slow-thinking systems.   To address this issue, in this paper, we explore a straightforward approach by fine-tuning a capable MLLM with a small amount of textual long-form thought data, resulting in a multimodal slow-thinking system, Virgo (Visual reasoning with long thought). We find that these long-form reasoning processes, expressed in natural language, can be effectively transferred to MLLMs. Moreover, it seems that such textual reasoning data can be even more effective than visual reasoning data in eliciting the slow-thinking capacities of MLLMs. While this work is preliminary, it demonstrates that slow-thinking capacities are fundamentally associated with the language model component, which can be transferred across modalities or domains. This finding can be leveraged to guide the development of more powerful slow-thinking reasoning systems.

Traditional safety mechanisms often focus on detecting explicit malicious intent, leaving deeper vulnerabilities unaddressed. In this work, we introduce a jailbreak technique, POATE (Polar Opposite query generation, Adversarial Template construction, and Elaboration), which leverages contrastive reasoning to elicit unethical responses. POATE generates prompts with semantically opposite intents and combines them with adversarial templates to subtly direct models toward producing harmful responses. We conduct extensive evaluations across six diverse language model families of varying parameter sizes, including LLaMA3, Gemma2, Phi3, and GPT-4, to demonstrate the robustness of the attack, achieving significantly higher attack success rates (~44%) compared to existing methods. We evaluate our proposed attack against seven safety defenses, revealing their limitations in addressing reasoning-based vulnerabilities. To counteract this, we propose a defense strategy that improves reasoning robustness through chain-of-thought prompting and reverse thinking, mitigating reasoning-driven adversarial exploits.|Rachneet Sachdeva et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01872)|null|
|**2025-01-03**|**Multi-Agent Conversational Online Learning for Adaptive LLM Response Identification**|The remarkable generative capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically generating responses for different applications. Given the dynamic nature of user preferences and the uncertainty of LLM response performance, it is crucial to design efficient online learning algorithms to identify optimal LLM responses (i.e., high-quality responses that also meet user preferences). Most existing online algorithms adopt a centralized approach and fail to leverage explicit user preferences for more efficient and personalized LLM response identification. In contrast, this paper introduces \textit{MACO} (\underline{M}ulti-\underline{A}gent \underline{C}onversational \underline{O}nline Learning for Adaptive LLM Response Identification): 1) The online LLM response identification process is accelerated by multiple local agents (such as smartphones), while enhancing data privacy; 2) A novel conversational mechanism is proposed to adaptively conduct conversations for soliciting user preferences (e.g., a preference for a humorous tone over a serious one in generated responses), so to minimize uncertainty in preference estimation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that \cadi\ is near-optimal regarding cumulative regret. Additionally, \cadi\ offers reduced communication costs and computational complexity by eliminating the traditional, computing-intensive ``G-optimal design" found in previous works. Extensive experiments with the open LLM \textit{Llama}, coupled with two different embedding models from Google and OpenAI for text vector representation, demonstrate that \cadi\ significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in online LLM response identification.|Xiangxiang Dai et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01849)|null|
|**2025-01-03**|**MoColl: Agent-Based Specific and General Model Collaboration for Image Captioning**|Image captioning is a critical task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications across various domains. For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we called \textbf{MoColl}, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond its role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to enhance its domain-specific capabilities. Experimental results on radiology report generation validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of generated reports.|Pu Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01834)|null|

While pre-trained foundation models have made considerable progress in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), their application to time series analysis has been hindered by data scarcity. Although several large language model (LLM)-based methods have been proposed for time series forecasting, time series captioning is under-explored in the context of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce TSLM, a novel time series language model designed specifically for time series captioning. TSLM operates as an encoder-decoder model, leveraging both text prompts and time series data representations to capture subtle temporal patterns across multiple phases and generate precise textual descriptions of time series inputs. TSLM addresses the data scarcity problem in time series captioning by first leveraging an in-context prompting synthetic data generation, and second denoising the generated data via a novel cross-modal dense retrieval scoring applied to time series-caption pairs. Experimental findings on various time series captioning datasets demonstrate that TSLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches from multiple data modalities by a significant margin.|Mohamed Trabelsi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01832)|null|

To address this challenge, we propose Auto-RT, a reinforcement learning framework that automatically explores and optimizes complex attack strategies to effectively uncover security vulnerabilities through malicious queries. Specifically, we introduce two key mechanisms to reduce exploration complexity and improve strategy optimization: 1) Early-terminated Exploration, which accelerate exploration by focusing on high-potential attack strategies; and 2) Progressive Reward Tracking algorithm with intermediate downgrade models, which dynamically refine the search trajectory toward successful vulnerability exploitation. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs demonstrate that, by significantly improving exploration efficiency and automatically optimizing attack strategies, Auto-RT detects a boarder range of vulnerabilities, achieving a faster detection speed and 16.63\% higher success rates compared to existing methods.|Yanjiang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01830)|null|

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has proven effective in aligning LLM behavior with human preferences across a variety of agent tasks. Existing DPO-based approaches for multi-turn interactions are divided into turn-level and session-level methods. The turn-level method is overly fine-grained, focusing exclusively on individual turns, while session-level methods are too coarse-grained, often introducing training noise. To address these limitations, we propose Segment-Level Direct Preference Optimization (SDPO), which focuses on specific key segments within interactions to optimize multi-turn agent behavior while minimizing training noise. Evaluations on the SOTOPIA benchmark demonstrate that SDPO-tuned agents consistently outperform both existing DPO-based methods and proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o, underscoring SDPO's potential to advance the social intelligence of LLM-based agents.

Routers represent one type of what we call LLM control planes: systems that orchestrate use of one or more LLMs. In this paper, we investigate routers' adversarial robustness.   We first define LLM control plane integrity, i.e., robustness of LLM orchestration to adversarial inputs, as a distinct problem in AI safety. Next, we demonstrate that an adversary can generate query-independent token sequences we call ``confounder gadgets'' that, when added to any query, cause LLM routers to send the query to a strong LLM.   Our quantitative evaluation shows that this attack is successful both in white-box and black-box settings against a variety of open-source and commercial routers, and that confounding queries do not affect the quality of LLM responses. Finally, we demonstrate that gadgets can be effective while maintaining low perplexity, thus perplexity-based filtering is not an effective defense. We finish by investigating alternative defenses.|Avital Shafran et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01818)|null|
|**2025-01-02**|**Unifying Specialized Visual Encoders for Video Language Models**|The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered sophisticated reasoning capabilities into the realm of video through Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). However, VideoLLMs currently rely on a single vision encoder for all of their visual processing, which limits the amount and type of visual information that can be conveyed to the LLM. Our method, MERV, Multi-Encoder Representation of Videos, instead leverages multiple frozen visual encoders to create a unified representation of a video, providing the VideoLLM with a comprehensive set of specialized visual knowledge. Spatio-temporally aligning the features from each encoder allows us to tackle a wider range of open-ended and multiple-choice video understanding questions and outperform prior state-of-the-art works. MERV is up to 3.7% better in accuracy than Video-LLaVA across the standard suite video understanding benchmarks, while also having a better Video-ChatGPT score. We also improve upon SeViLA, the previous best on zero-shot Perception Test accuracy, by 2.2%. MERV introduces minimal extra parameters and trains faster than equivalent single-encoder methods while parallelizing the visual processing. Finally, we provide qualitative evidence that MERV successfully captures domain knowledge from each of its encoders. Our results offer promising directions in utilizing multiple vision encoders for comprehensive video understanding.|Jihoon Chung et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01426)|null|
|**2025-01-02**|**OmniChat: Enhancing Spoken Dialogue Systems with Scalable Synthetic Data for Diverse Scenarios**|With the rapid development of large language models, researchers have created increasingly advanced spoken dialogue systems that can naturally converse with humans. However, these systems still struggle to handle the full complexity of real-world conversations, including audio events, musical contexts, and emotional expressions, mainly because current dialogue datasets are constrained in both scale and scenario diversity. In this paper, we propose leveraging synthetic data to enhance the dialogue models across diverse scenarios. We introduce ShareChatX, the first comprehensive, large-scale dataset for spoken dialogue that spans diverse scenarios. Based on this dataset, we introduce OmniChat, a multi-turn dialogue system with a heterogeneous feature fusion module, designed to optimize feature selection in different dialogue contexts. In addition, we explored critical aspects of training dialogue systems using synthetic data. Through comprehensive experimentation, we determined the ideal balance between synthetic and real data, achieving state-of-the-art results on the real-world dialogue dataset DailyTalk. We also highlight the crucial importance of synthetic data in tackling diverse, complex dialogue scenarios, especially those involving audio and music.

|**2025-01-02**|**ViGiL3D: A Linguistically Diverse Dataset for 3D Visual Grounding**|3D visual grounding (3DVG) involves localizing entities in a 3D scene referred to by natural language text. Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.|Austin T.

|**2025-01-02**|**Aligning Large Language Models for Faithful Integrity Against Opposing Argument**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, they can be easily misled by unfaithful arguments during conversations, even when their original statements are correct. To this end, we investigate the problem of maintaining faithful integrity in LLMs. This involves ensuring that LLMs adhere to their faithful statements in the face of opposing arguments and are able to correct their incorrect statements when presented with faithful arguments. In this work, we propose a novel framework, named Alignment for Faithful Integrity with Confidence Estimation (AFICE), which aims to align the LLM responses with faithful integrity. Specifically, AFICE first designs a Bilateral Confidence Estimation (BCE) approach for estimating the uncertainty of each response generated by the LLM given a specific context, which simultaneously estimate the model's confidence to the question based on the internal states during decoding as well as to the answer based on cumulative probability ratios. With the BCE, we construct a conversational preference dataset composed of context, original statement, and argument, which is adopted for aligning the LLM for faithful integrity using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experimental results on a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in the LLM's ability to maintain faithful responses when encountering opposing arguments, ensuring both the practical utility and trustworthiness of LLMs in complex interactive settings.

|**2025-01-02**|**CySecBench: Generative AI-based CyberSecurity-focused Prompt Dataset for Benchmarking Large Language Models**|Numerous studies have investigated methods for jailbreaking Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful content. Typically, these methods are evaluated using datasets of malicious prompts designed to bypass security policies established by LLM providers. However, the generally broad scope and open-ended nature of existing datasets can complicate the assessment of jailbreaking effectiveness, particularly in specific domains, notably cybersecurity. To address this issue, we present and publicly release CySecBench, a comprehensive dataset containing 12662 prompts specifically designed to evaluate jailbreaking techniques in the cybersecurity domain. The dataset is organized into 10 distinct attack-type categories, featuring close-ended prompts to enable a more consistent and accurate assessment of jailbreaking attempts. Furthermore, we detail our methodology for dataset generation and filtration, which can be adapted to create similar datasets in other domains. To demonstrate the utility of CySecBench, we propose and evaluate a jailbreaking approach based on prompt obfuscation. Our experimental results show that this method successfully elicits harmful content from commercial black-box LLMs, achieving Success Rates (SRs) of 65% with ChatGPT and 88% with Gemini; in contrast, Claude demonstrated greater resilience with a jailbreaking SR of 17%. Compared to existing benchmark approaches, our method shows superior performance, highlighting the value of domain-specific evaluation datasets for assessing LLM security measures. Moreover, when evaluated using prompts from a widely used dataset (i.e., AdvBench), it achieved an SR of 78.5%, higher than the state-of-the-art methods.|Johan Wahréus et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01335)|null|
|**2025-01-02**|**Decoding Knowledge in Large Language Models: A Framework for Categorization and Comprehension**|Understanding how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and apply knowledge remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel framework, K-(CSA)^2, which categorizes LLM knowledge along two dimensions: correctness and confidence. The framework defines six categories of knowledge, ranging from highly confident correctness to confidently held misconceptions, enabling a nuanced evaluation of model comprehension beyond binary accuracy. Using this framework, we demonstrate how techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and reinforcement learning with human feedback fundamentally alter the knowledge structures of internal (pre-trained) and external (context-dependent) knowledge in LLMs. CoT particularly enhances base model performance and shows synergistic benefits when applied to aligned LLMs. Moreover, our layer-wise analysis reveals that higher layers in LLMs encode more high-confidence knowledge, while low-confidence knowledge tends to emerge in middle-to-lower layers.|Yanbo Fang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01332)|null|
|**2025-01-02**|**The Prompt Alchemist: Automated LLM-Tailored Prompt Optimization for Test Case Generation**|Test cases are essential for validating the reliability and quality of software applications. Recent studies have demonstrated the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate useful test cases for given source code. However, the existing work primarily relies on human-written plain prompts, which often leads to suboptimal results since the performance of LLMs can be highly influenced by the prompts. Moreover, these approaches use the same prompt for all LLMs, overlooking the fact that different LLMs might be best suited to different prompts. Given the wide variety of possible prompt formulations, automatically discovering the optimal prompt for each LLM presents a significant challenge. Although there are methods on automated prompt optimization in the natural language processing field, they are hard to produce effective prompts for the test case generation task. First, the methods iteratively optimize prompts by simply combining and mutating existing ones without proper guidance, resulting in prompts that lack diversity and tend to repeat the same errors in the generated test cases. Second, the prompts are generally lack of domain contextual knowledge, limiting LLMs' performance in the task.|Shuzheng Gao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01329)|null|
|**2025-01-02**|**Learning Spectral Methods by Transformers**|Transformers demonstrate significant advantages as the building block of modern LLMs. In this work, we study the capacities of Transformers in performing unsupervised learning. We show that multi-layered Transformers, given a sufficiently large set of pre-training instances, are able to learn the algorithms themselves and perform statistical estimation tasks given new instances. This learning paradigm is distinct from the in-context learning setup and is similar to the learning procedure of human brains where skills are learned through past experience. Theoretically, we prove that pre-trained Transformers can learn the spectral methods and use the classification of bi-class Gaussian mixture model as an example. Our proof is constructive using algorithmic design techniques. Our results are built upon the similarities of multi-layered Transformer architecture with the iterative recovery algorithms used in practice. Empirically, we verify the strong capacity of the multi-layered (pre-trained) Transformer on unsupervised learning through the lens of both the PCA and the Clustering tasks performed on the synthetic and real-world datasets.|Yihan He et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01312)|null|
|**2025-01-03**|**Think More, Hallucinate Less: Mitigating Hallucinations via Dual Process of Fast and Slow Thinking**|Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities, yet still face the hallucination issue. Typical text generation approaches adopt an auto-regressive generation without deliberate reasoning, which often results in untrustworthy and factually inaccurate responses. In this paper, we propose HaluSearch, a novel framework that incorporates tree search-based algorithms (e.g. MCTS) to enable an explicit slow thinking generation process for mitigating hallucinations of LLMs during inference. Specifically, HaluSearch frames text generation as a step-by-step reasoning process, using a self-evaluation reward model to score each generation step and guide the tree search towards the most reliable generation pathway for fully exploiting the internal knowledge of LLMs. To balance efficiency and quality, we introduce a hierarchical thinking system switch mechanism inspired by the dual process theory in cognitive science, which dynamically alternates between fast and slow thinking modes at both the instance and step levels, adapting to the complexity of questions and reasoning states. We conduct extensive experiments on both English and Chinese datasets and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline approaches.|Xiaoxue Cheng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01306)|null|

For LLMs to be effective in supporting diagnostic assessments, it is essential that they closely replicate the standard diagnostic procedures used by clinicians. In this paper, we specifically examine the diagnostic assessment processes described in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for major depressive disorder (MDD) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). We investigate various prompting and fine-tuning techniques to guide both proprietary and open-source LLMs in adhering to these processes, and we evaluate the agreement between LLM-generated diagnostic outcomes and expert-validated ground truth. For fine-tuning, we utilize the Mentalllama and Llama models, while for prompting, we experiment with proprietary models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as llama-3.1-8b and mixtral-8x7b.|Kaushik Roy et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01305)|null|
|**2024-12-30**|**Distributed Mixture-of-Agents for Edge Inference with Large Language Models**|Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) has recently been proposed as a method to enhance performance of large language models (LLMs), enabling multiple individual LLMs to work together for collaborative inference. This collaborative approach results in improved responses to user prompts compared to relying on a single LLM. In this paper, we consider such an MoA architecture in a distributed setting, where LLMs operate on individual edge devices, each uniquely associated with a user and equipped with its own distributed computing power. These devices exchange information using decentralized gossip algorithms, allowing different device nodes to talk without the supervision of a centralized server. In the considered setup, different users have their own LLM models to address user prompts. Additionally, the devices gossip either their own user-specific prompts or augmented prompts to generate more refined answers to certain queries. User prompts are temporarily stored in the device queues when their corresponding LLMs are busy. Given the memory limitations of edge devices, it is crucial to ensure that the average queue sizes in the system remain bounded. In this paper, we address this by theoretically calculating the queuing stability conditions for the device queues under reasonable assumptions, which we validate experimentally as well. Further, we demonstrate through experiments, leveraging open-source LLMs for the implementation of distributed MoA, that certain MoA configurations produce higher-quality responses compared to others, as evaluated on AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/purbeshmitra/distributed_moa.|Purbesh Mitra et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21200)|**[link](https://github.com/purbeshmitra/distributed_moa)**|

They must solve the base problem and then utilize its solution to address the more complex one. This work features three key contributions. First, we propose a general recipe for generating more challenging versions of existing benchmarks, resulting in three new benchmarks: HumanEval Pro, MBPP Pro, and BigCodeBench-Lite Pro, specifically designed to assess LLMs on self-invoking code generation. Second, from the analysis of experimental results over twenty LLMs on our benchmarks, we have two important observations: (i) Most LLMs excel in traditional code generation benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP, but their performance declines on self-invoking tasks. For example, o1-mini achieves 96.2% pass@1 on HumanEval but only 76.2% on HumanEval Pro. (ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned models demonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models. Third, we disclose the types of failure modes that exist in our evaluation results. All these results underscore the need for further advancements in self-invoking code generation tasks and provide a new direction for future research on enhancing LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.|Zhaojian Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21199)|**[link](https://github.com/CodeEval-Pro/CodeEval-Pro)**|

These models employ extended chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, exploring multiple strategies to enhance problem-solving capabilities. However, a critical question remains: How to intelligently and efficiently scale computational resources during testing. This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the prevalent issue of overthinking in these models, where excessive computational resources are allocated for simple problems with minimal benefit. We introduce novel efficiency metrics from both outcome and process perspectives to evaluate the rational use of computational resources by o1-like models. Using a self-training paradigm, we propose strategies to mitigate overthinking, streamlining reasoning processes without compromising accuracy. Experimental results show that our approach successfully reduces computational overhead while preserving model performance across a range of testsets with varying difficulty levels, such as GSM8K, MATH500, GPQA, and AIME.|Xingyu Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21187)|null|
|**2024-12-30**|**Aviary: training language agents on challenging scientific tasks**|Solving complex real-world tasks requires cycles of actions and observations. This is particularly true in science, where tasks require many cycles of analysis, tool use, and experimentation. Language agents are promising for automating intellectual tasks in science because they can interact with tools via natural language or code. Yet their flexibility creates conceptual and practical challenges for software implementations, since agents may comprise non-standard components such as internal reasoning, planning, tool usage, as well as the inherent stochasticity of temperature-sampled language models. Here, we introduce Aviary, an extensible gymnasium for language agents. We formalize agents as policies solving language-grounded partially observable Markov decision processes, which we term language decision processes. We then implement five environments, including three challenging scientific environments: (1) manipulating DNA constructs for molecular cloning, (2) answering research questions by accessing scientific literature, and (3) engineering protein stability. These environments were selected for their focus on multi-step reasoning and their relevance to contemporary biology research. Finally, with online training and scaling inference-time compute, we show that language agents backed by open-source, non-frontier LLMs can match and exceed both frontier LLM agents and human experts on multiple tasks at up to 100x lower inference cost.|Siddharth Narayanan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21154)|null|
|**2024-12-30**|**Facilitating large language model Russian adaptation with Learned Embedding Propagation**|Rapid advancements of large language model (LLM) technologies led to the introduction of powerful open-source instruction-tuned LLMs that have the same text generation quality as the state-of-the-art counterparts such as GPT-4. While the emergence of such models accelerates the adoption of LLM technologies in sensitive-information environments the authors of such models don not disclose the training data necessary for replication of the results thus making the achievements model-exclusive. Since those open-source models are also multilingual this in turn reduces the benefits of training a language specific LLMs as improved inference computation efficiency becomes the only guaranteed advantage of such costly procedure. More cost-efficient options such as vocabulary extension and subsequent continued pre-training are also inhibited by the lack of access to high-quality instruction-tuning data since it is the major factor behind the resulting LLM task-solving capabilities. To address the limitations and cut the costs of the language adaptation pipeline we propose Learned Embedding Propagation (LEP). Unlike existing approaches our method has lower training data size requirements due to minimal impact on existing LLM knowledge which we reinforce using novel ad-hoc embedding propagation procedure that allows to skip the instruction-tuning step and instead implant the new language knowledge directly into any existing instruct-tuned variant. We evaluated four Russian vocabulary adaptations for LLaMa-3-8B and Mistral-7B, showing that LEP is competitive with traditional instruction-tuning methods, achieving performance comparable to OpenChat 3.5 and LLaMa-3-8B-Instruct, with further improvements via self-calibration and continued tuning enhancing task-solving capabilities.|Mikhail Tikhomirov et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21140)|**[link](https://github.com/RefalMachine/llmtf_open)**|

Despite regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data owners still have limited control over the use of their content in model training. To address this, we propose ExpShield, a proactive self-guard mechanism that empowers content owners to embed invisible perturbations into their text, limiting data misuse in LLMs training without affecting readability. This preemptive approach enables data owners to protect sensitive content directly, without relying on a third-party to perform defense. Starting from the random perturbation, we demonstrate the rationale for using perturbation to conceal protected content. We further enhance the efficiency by identifying memorization triggers and creating pitfalls to diverge the model memorization in a more focused way. To validate our defense's effectiveness, we propose a novel metric of instance exploitation which captures the individual risk raised by model training. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach as the MIA AUC decreases from 0.95 to 0.55, and instance exploitation approaches zero. This suggests that the individual risk does not increase after training, underscoring the significance of proactive defenses in protecting copyrighted data.|Ruixuan Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21123)|null|
|**2024-12-30**|**Exploring and Controlling Diversity in LLM-Agent Conversation**|Diversity is a critical aspect of multi-agent communication. In this paper, we focus on controlling and exploring diversity in the context of open-domain multi-agent conversations, particularly for world simulation applications. We propose Adaptive Prompt Pruning (APP), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the content of the utterance generation prompt to control diversity using a single parameter, lambda. Through extensive experiments, we show that APP effectively controls the output diversity across models and datasets, with pruning more information leading to more diverse output. We comprehensively analyze the relationship between prompt content and conversational diversity. Our findings reveal that information from all components of the prompt generally constrains the diversity of the output, with the Memory block exerting the most significant influence. APP is compatible with established techniques like temperature sampling and top-p sampling, providing a versatile tool for diversity management. To address the trade-offs of increased diversity, such as inconsistencies with omitted information, we incorporate a post-generation correction step, which effectively balances diversity enhancement with output consistency. Additionally, we examine how prompt structure, including component order and length, impacts diversity. This study addresses key questions surrounding diversity in multi-agent world simulation, offering insights into its control, influencing factors, and associated trade-offs.

To address this, we propose CLAP-Ranked Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that iteratively generates and optimizes preference data to enhance TTA alignment. We demonstrate that the audio preference dataset generated using CRPO outperforms existing alternatives.

In particular, geometric perception, the ability to interpret spatial relationships and abstract visual patterns, remains underexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce GePBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess the geometric perception capabilities of MLLMs. Results from extensive evaluations reveal that current state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in such tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that models trained with data sourced from GePBench show notable improvements on a wide range of downstream tasks, underscoring the importance of geometric perception as a foundation for advanced multimodal applications.

Automating this translation process using large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, but the lack of high-quality, specialized datasets has hindered their effectiveness. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel multi-turn dialogue dataset, Fortran2CPP, specifically designed for Fortran-to-C++ code migration. Our dataset, significantly larger than existing alternatives, is generated using a unique LLM-driven, dual-agent pipeline incorporating iterative compilation, execution, and code repair to ensure high quality and functional correctness. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset, we fine-tuned several open-weight LLMs on Fortran2CPP and evaluated their performance on two independent benchmarks. Fine-tuning on our dataset led to remarkable gains, with models achieving up to a 3.31x increase in CodeBLEU score and a 92\% improvement in compilation success rate. This highlights the dataset's ability to enhance both the syntactic accuracy and compilability of the translated C++ code.

|**2024-12-27**|**Can Large Language Models Adapt to Other Agents In-Context?**|As the research community aims to build better AI assistants that are more dynamic and personalized to the diversity of humans that they interact with, there is increased interest in evaluating the theory of mind capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Indeed, several recent studies suggest that LLM theory of mind capabilities are quite impressive, approximating human-level performance. Our paper aims to rebuke this narrative and argues instead that past studies were not directly measuring agent performance, potentially leading to findings that are illusory in nature as a result. We draw a strong distinction between what we call literal theory of mind i.e. measuring the agent's ability to predict the behavior of others and functional theory of mind i.e. adapting to agents in-context based on a rational response to predictions of their behavior. We find that top performing open source LLMs may display strong capabilities in literal theory of mind, depending on how they are prompted, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even when partner policies are exceedingly simple. Our work serves to highlight the double sided nature of inductive bias in LLMs when adapting to new situations. While this bias can lead to strong performance over limited horizons, it often hinders convergence to optimal long-term behavior.|Matthew Riemer et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19726)|null|
|**2024-12-27**|**Toward Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models with Thought Rollback**|Large language models (LLMs) have been routinely used to solve various tasks using step-by-step reasoning. However, the structure of intermediate reasoning steps, or thoughts, is rigid and unidirectional, such as chains, trees, or acyclic-directed graphs. Consequently, the resulting inflexible and forward-only reasoning may not address challenging tasks and fail when the LLM frequently gives false responses, i.e., ``hallucinations''. This paper proposes a new reasoning framework, called Thought Rollback (TR), allowing LLMs to adaptively build thought structure while maintaining effective reasoning toward problem-solving under ``hallucinations''. The core mechanism of TR is rolling back thoughts, which allows LLMs to perform error analysis on thoughts, and thus roll back to any previously mistaken thought for revision. Subsequently, by including such trial-and-error in the prompt to guide the LLM, each rollback leads to one more reliable reasoning path. Therefore, starting with a simple prompt without human annotations, LLM with TR adaptively and gradually explores thoughts for a correct solution. Comprehensive experiments on mathematical problems and multi-task reasoning demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TR in terms of problem-solving rate and interaction cost. For instance, the solving rate of GPT-4 with TR outperforms the current best by $9\%$ on the MATH dataset.|Sijia Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19707)|**[link](https://github.com/iQua/llmpebase)**|
|**2024-12-27**|**A Large-scale Interpretable Multi-modality Benchmark for Facial Image Forgery Localization**|Image forgery localization, which centers on identifying tampered pixels within an image, has seen significant advancements. Traditional approaches often model this challenge as a variant of image segmentation, treating the binary segmentation of forged areas as the end product. We argue that the basic binary forgery mask is inadequate for explaining model predictions. It doesn't clarify why the model pinpoints certain areas and treats all forged pixels the same, making it hard to spot the most fake-looking parts. In this study, we mitigate the aforementioned limitations by generating salient region-focused interpretation for the forgery images. To support this, we craft a Multi-Modal Tramper Tracing (MMTT) dataset, comprising facial images manipulated using deepfake techniques and paired with manual, interpretable textual annotations. To harvest high-quality annotation, annotators are instructed to meticulously observe the manipulated images and articulate the typical characteristics of the forgery regions. Subsequently, we collect a dataset of 128,303 image-text pairs. Leveraging the MMTT dataset, we develop ForgeryTalker, an architecture designed for concurrent forgery localization and interpretation. ForgeryTalker first trains a forgery prompter network to identify the pivotal clues within the explanatory text. Subsequently, the region prompter is incorporated into multimodal large language model for finetuning to achieve the dual goals of localization and interpretation. Extensive experiments conducted on the MMTT dataset verify the superior performance of our proposed model. The dataset, code as well as pretrained checkpoints will be made publicly available to facilitate further research and ensure the reproducibility of our results.|Jingchun Lian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19685)|null|
|**2024-12-27**|**Boosting Private Domain Understanding of Efficient MLLMs: A Tuning-free, Adaptive, Universal Prompt Optimization Framework**|Efficient multimodal large language models (EMLLMs), in contrast to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), reduce model size and computational costs and are often deployed on resource-constrained devices. However, due to data privacy concerns, existing open-source EMLLMs rarely have access to private domain-specific data during the pre-training process, making them difficult to directly apply in device-specific domains, such as certain business scenarios. To address this weakness, this paper focuses on the efficient adaptation of EMLLMs to private domains, specifically in two areas: 1) how to reduce data requirements, and 2) how to avoid parameter fine-tuning. Specifically, we propose a tun\textbf{\underline{I}}ng-free, a\textbf{\underline{D}}aptiv\textbf{\underline{E}}, univers\textbf{\underline{AL}} \textbf{\underline{Prompt}} Optimization Framework, abbreviated as \textit{\textbf{\ourmethod{}}} which consists of two stages: 1) Predefined Prompt, based on the reinforcement searching strategy, generate a prompt optimization strategy tree to acquire optimization priors; 2) Prompt Reflection initializes the prompt based on optimization priors, followed by self-reflection to further search and refine the prompt. By doing so, \ourmethod{} elegantly generates the ``ideal prompts'' for processing private domain-specific data. Note that our method requires no parameter fine-tuning and only a small amount of data to quickly adapt to the data distribution of private data. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that our proposed \ourmethod{} significantly improves both efficiency and performance compared to baselines.|Jiang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19684)|null|

Existing methods for creating CAD models rely on latent vectors or point clouds, which are difficult to obtain and costly to store. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have inspired researchers to use natural language instructions and images for CAD model construction. However, these models still struggle with inferring accurate 3D spatial location and orientation, leading to inaccuracies in determining the spatial 3D starting points and extrusion directions for constructing geometries. This work introduces CAD-GPT, a CAD synthesis method with spatial reasoning-enhanced MLLM that takes either a single image or a textual description as input. To achieve precise spatial inference, our approach introduces a 3D Modeling Spatial Mechanism. This method maps 3D spatial positions and 3D sketch plane rotation angles into a 1D linguistic feature space using a specialized spatial unfolding mechanism, while discretizing 2D sketch coordinates into an appropriate planar space to enable precise determination of spatial starting position, sketch orientation, and 2D sketch coordinate translations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAD-GPT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in CAD model synthesis, both quantitatively and qualitatively.|Siyu Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19663)|null|

Generative linguistic steganography leverages the probability distribution of language models (LMs) and applies steganographic algorithms to generate stego tokens, gaining attention with recent Large Language Model (LLM) advancements. To enhance security, researchers develop distribution-preserving stego algorithms to minimize the gap between stego sampling and LM sampling. However, the reliance on language model distributions, coupled with deviations from real-world cover texts, results in insufficient imperceptibility when facing steganalysis detectors in real-world scenarios. Moreover, LLM distributions tend to be more deterministic, resulting in reduced entropy and, consequently, lower embedding capacity. In this paper, we propose FreStega, a plug-and-play method to reconstruct the distribution of language models used for generative linguistic steganography. FreStega dynamically adjusts token probabilities from the language model at each step of stegotext auto-regressive generation, leveraging both sequential and spatial dimensions. In sequential adjustment, the temperature is dynamically adjusted based on instantaneous entropy, enhancing the diversity of stego texts and boosting embedding capacity. In the spatial dimension, the distribution is aligned with guidance from the target domain corpus, closely mimicking real cover text in the target domain. By reforming the distribution, FreStega enhances the imperceptibility of stego text in practical scenarios and improves steganographic capacity by 15.41\%, all without compromising the quality of the generated text. FreStega serves as a plug-and-play remedy to enhance the imperceptibility and embedding capacity of existing distribution-preserving steganography methods in real-world scenarios.|Kaiyi Pang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19652)|null|

|**2024-12-24**|**Long-Form Speech Generation with Spoken Language Models**|We consider the generative modeling of speech over multiple minutes, a requirement for long-form multimedia generation and audio-native voice assistants. However, current spoken language models struggle to generate plausible speech past tens of seconds, from high temporal resolution of speech tokens causing loss of coherence, to architectural issues with long-sequence training or extrapolation, to memory costs at inference time. With these considerations we propose SpeechSSM, the first speech language model to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates, based on recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling. Furthermore, to address growing challenges in spoken language evaluation, especially in this new long-form setting, we propose: new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; quality measurements over length and time; and a new benchmark for long-form speech processing and generation, LibriSpeech-Long.

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments.

|**2024-12-24**|**A Paragraph is All It Takes: Rich Robot Behaviors from Interacting, Trusted LLMs**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are compact representations of all public knowledge of our physical environment and animal and human behaviors. The application of LLMs to robotics may offer a path to highly capable robots that perform well across most human tasks with limited or even zero tuning. Aside from increasingly sophisticated reasoning and task planning, networks of (suitably designed) LLMs offer ease of upgrading capabilities and allow humans to directly observe the robot's thinking. Here we explore the advantages, limitations, and particularities of using LLMs to control physical robots. The basic system consists of four LLMs communicating via a human language data bus implemented via web sockets and ROS2 message passing. Surprisingly, rich robot behaviors and good performance across different tasks could be achieved despite the robot's data fusion cycle running at only 1Hz and the central data bus running at the extremely limited rates of the human brain, of around 40 bits/s. The use of natural language for inter-LLM communication allowed the robot's reasoning and decision making to be directly observed by humans and made it trivial to bias the system's behavior with sets of rules written in plain English. These rules were immutably written into Ethereum, a global, public, and censorship resistant Turing-complete computer. We suggest that by using natural language as the data bus among interacting AIs, and immutable public ledgers to store behavior constraints, it is possible to build robots that combine unexpectedly rich performance, upgradability, and durable alignment with humans.|OpenMind et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18588)|null|
|**2024-12-24**|**Exploring Embedding Priors in Prompt-Tuning for Improved Interpretability and Control**|Prompt-Tuning is an efficient method for adapting pre-trained language models to new tasks with minimal computational overhead by modifying prompt embeddings. In this work, we investigate how crucial the phenomenon of embedding collapse, frequently observed in Prompt-Tuning, is for the final performance of the model. To address this question, we designed embedding priors and compared them with posteriors of the converged Soft and Deep Prompt-Tuning methods. Our findings suggest that priors strongly affect the position of the tuned embeddings, and models can effectively work with embeddings from different parts of activation spaces, including completely new regions. As the final Prompt-Tuning capabilities are limited, we hypothesize that controllable Prompt-Tuning posteriors may serve as a good starting point for tasks such as chain-of-thought (COT) distillation. Our experiments also show that generated trajectories are not localized in the activation space of the models. However, there are distinct clusters of activations for distant tasks (e.g., NLP and arithmetic), while activations between NLP tasks (e.g., Question-Answering and MLM) lie in the same cluster. These observations raise questions about the importance of a single activation cluster for the generalization abilities of large language models.|Sergey Sedov et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18582)|null|
|**2024-12-24**|**How Well Do LLMs Generate Code for Different Application Domains? Benchmark and Evaluation**|Recently, an increasing number of AI-driven programming assistants powered by code LLMs have been integrated into various real-world software development environments, significantly boosting developer productivity. However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily focus on general-purpose scenarios, leaving the code generation performance of LLMs for specific application domains largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, MultiCodeBench, to fill this gap. MultiCodeBench comprises 2,400 programming tasks, covering 12 popular software development domains and 15 programming languages. Specifically, we perform in-depth research to identify these 12 application domains. Given that each domain may involve multiple technical frameworks, and that different frameworks present distinct challenges in the coding process, we categorize the commonly used frameworks and platforms within each domain. We then sample programming problems from GitHub repositories related to these subdomains. To ensure the quality of the tasks and mitigate data leakage issues, we invite annotators to rewrite the docstrings for each task in MultiCodeBench. Additionally, we build a static analysis-based dependency parsing tool to extract the dependencies in the ground truth for each task, enabling deeper performance analysis. Through extensive experiments on MultiCodeBench with eleven representative mainstream LLMs, we reveal the code generation performance of the LLMs across different application domains, providing practical insights for developers in downstream fields when selecting LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze the reasons behind the models' failures in completing software application development tasks, offering guidance for model developers to enhance domain-specific code generation capabilities.|Dewu Zheng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18573)|**[link](https://github.com/deepsoftwareanalytics/multicodebench)**|

In this work, we propose to leverage a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to perform ST and ASR in languages for which the model has never seen paired audio-text data. We achieve this by using a pre-trained multilingual speech encoder, a multilingual LLM, and a lightweight adaptation module that maps the audio representations to the token embedding space of the LLM. We perform several experiments both in ST and ASR to understand how to best train the model and what data has the most impact on performance in previously unseen languages. In ST, our best model is capable to achieve BLEU scores over 23 in CoVoST2 for two previously unseen languages, while in ASR, we achieve WERs of up to 28.2\%. We finally show that the performance of our system is bounded by the ability of the LLM to output text in the desired language.|Karel Mundnich et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18566)|null|
|**2024-12-24**|**Distilling Fine-grained Sentiment Understanding from Large Language Models**|Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FSA) aims to extract and summarize user opinions from vast opinionated text. Recent studies demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) possess exceptional sentiment understanding capabilities. However, directly deploying LLMs for FSA applications incurs high inference costs. Therefore, this paper investigates the distillation of fine-grained sentiment understanding from LLMs into small language models (SLMs). We prompt LLMs to examine and interpret the sentiments of given reviews and then utilize the generated content to pretrain SLMs. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive FSA benchmark to evaluate both SLMs and LLMs. Extensive experiments on this benchmark reveal that: (1) distillation significantly enhances the performance of SLMs in FSA tasks, achieving a 6.00\% improvement in $F_1$ -score, and the distilled model can outperform Llama-2-7b with only 220M parameters; (2) distillation equips SLMs with excellent zero-shot sentiment classification capabilities, enabling them to match or even exceed their teacher models. These results suggest that distillation from LLMs is a highly promising direction for FSA.

Unlike traditional approaches that average performance and safety metrics, Libra-Leaderboard uses a distance-to-optimal-score method to calculate the overall rankings. This approach incentivizes models to achieve a balance rather than excelling in one dimension at the expense of some other ones. In the first release, Libra-Leaderboard evaluates 26 mainstream LLMs from 14 leading organizations, identifying critical safety challenges even in state-of-the-art models.|Haonan Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18551)|null|
|**2024-12-24**|**Token-Budget-Aware LLM Reasoning**|Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework, which dynamically estimates token budgets for different problems based on reasoning complexity and uses the estimated token budgets to guide the reasoning process. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

|**2024-12-24**|**Consistency Checks for Language Model Forecasters**|Forecasting is a task that is difficult to evaluate: the ground truth can only be known in the future. Recent work showing LLM forecasters rapidly approaching human-level performance begs the question: how can we benchmark and evaluate these forecasters instantaneously? Following the consistency check framework, we measure the performance of forecasters in terms of the consistency of their predictions on different logically-related questions. We propose a new, general consistency metric based on arbitrage: for example, if a forecasting AI illogically predicts that both the Democratic and Republican parties have 60% probability of winning the 2024 US presidential election, an arbitrageur can trade against the forecaster's predictions and make a profit. We build an automated evaluation system that generates a set of base questions, instantiates consistency checks from these questions, elicits the predictions of the forecaster, and measures the consistency of the predictions. We then build a standard, proper-scoring-rule forecasting benchmark, and show that our (instantaneous) consistency metrics correlate with LLM forecasters' ground truth Brier scores (which are only known in the future). We also release a consistency benchmark that resolves in 2028, providing a long-term evaluation tool for forecasting.|Daniel Paleka et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18544)|null|

Unlike previous methods that struggle in real-world scenarios or lack interactive editing capabilities, ChatGarment can estimate sewing patterns from in-the-wild images or sketches, generate them from text descriptions, and edit garments based on user instructions, all within an interactive dialogue. These sewing patterns can then be draped into 3D garments, which are easily animatable and simulatable. This is achieved by finetuning a VLM to directly generate a JSON file that includes both textual descriptions of garment types and styles, as well as continuous numerical attributes. This JSON file is then used to create sewing patterns through a programming parametric model. To support this, we refine the existing programming model, GarmentCode, by expanding its garment type coverage and simplifying its structure for efficient VLM fine-tuning. Additionally, we construct a large-scale dataset of image-to-sewing-pattern and text-to-sewing-pattern pairs through an automated data pipeline. Extensive evaluations demonstrate ChatGarment's ability to accurately reconstruct, generate, and edit garments from multimodal inputs, highlighting its potential to revolutionize workflows in fashion and gaming applications.

Addressing this question can deepen our understanding of the processes behind idea brainstorming and inspire the automatic discovery of novel scientific insights. In this work, we propose ResearchTown, a multi-agent framework for research community simulation. Within this framework, the human research community is simplified and modeled as an agent-data graph, where researchers and papers are represented as agent-type and data-type nodes, respectively, and connected based on their collaboration relationships. We also introduce TextGNN, a text-based inference framework that models various research activities (e.g., paper reading, paper writing, and review writing) as special forms of a unified message-passing process on the agent-data graph. To evaluate the quality of the research simulation, we present ResearchBench, a benchmark that uses a node-masking prediction task for scalable and objective assessment based on similarity. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) ResearchTown can provide a realistic simulation of collaborative research activities, including paper writing and review writing; (2) ResearchTown can maintain robust simulation with multiple researchers and diverse papers; (3) ResearchTown can generate interdisciplinary research ideas that potentially inspire novel research directions.|Haofei Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17767)|**[link](https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/research-town)**|

Although some researchers have quietly shifted to a more appropriate scheme over the last year, the implications of this change have yet to be widely acknowledged. We highlight this overlooked shift, show how similar evaluation practices falsely imply reasoning deficits in other benchmarks, and demonstrate that fairer methods dramatically reduce performance gaps (e.g. on SIQA) and even yield superhuman results (OpenBookQA).

|**2024-12-23**|**Deliberation in Latent Space via Differentiable Cache Augmentation**|Techniques enabling large language models (LLMs) to "think more" by generating and attending to intermediate reasoning steps have shown promise in solving complex problems. However, the standard approaches generate sequences of discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur significant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we demonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the cache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of subsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss from the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself frozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its kv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate offline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the coprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra computation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder achieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even without any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a range of reasoning-intensive tasks.|Luyang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17747)|null|

Many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the performance of such code translators. However, previous benchmarks mostly provide fine-grained samples, focusing at either code snippet, function, or file-level code translation. Such benchmarks do not accurately reflect real-world demands, where entire repositories often need to be translated, involving longer code length and more complex functionalities. To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, named RepoTransBench, which is a real-world repository-level code translation benchmark with an automatically executable test suite. We conduct experiments on RepoTransBench to evaluate the translation performance of 11 advanced LLMs. We find that the Success@1 score (test success in one attempt) of the best-performing LLM is only 7.33%. To further explore the potential of LLMs for repository-level code translation, we provide LLMs with error-related feedback to perform iterative debugging and observe an average 7.09% improvement on Success@1. However, even with this improvement, the Success@1 score of the best-performing LLM is only 21%, which may not meet the need for reliable automatic repository-level code translation. Finally, we conduct a detailed error analysis and highlight current LLMs' deficiencies in repository-level code translation, which could provide a reference for further improvements.|Yanli Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17744)|null|

However, we observe that little research has looked into how it works.In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained by computing the semantic similarity between the $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token and the image token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA encoder and SAM decoder. Intriguingly, we have found that a striking consistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map,which reveals that what $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token contributes to is the semantic similarity within image-text pairs. Specifically, $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a placeholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual tokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the paired image while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned. Upon the above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient $\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\textbf{D}$ under the guidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps.

We test ten LLMs through direct and chain-of-thought prompting, revealing that Chumor poses significant challenges to existing LLMs, with their accuracy slightly above random and far below human. In addition, our analysis highlights that human-annotated humor explanations are significantly better than those generated by GPT-4o and ERNIE-4-turbo.

|**2024-12-23**|**Knowledge Editing through Chain-of-Thought**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, keeping these models up-to-date with evolving world knowledge remains a significant challenge due to the high costs of frequent retraining. To address this challenge, knowledge editing techniques have emerged to update LLMs with new information without rebuilding the model from scratch. Among these, the in-context editing paradigm stands out for its effectiveness in integrating new knowledge while preserving the model's original capabilities. Despite its potential, existing in-context knowledge editing methods are often task-specific, focusing primarily on multi-hop QA tasks using structured knowledge triples. Moreover, their reliance on few-shot prompting for task decomposition makes them unstable and less effective in generalizing across diverse tasks.   In response to these limitations, we propose EditCoT, a novel knowledge editing framework that flexibly and efficiently updates LLMs across various tasks without retraining. EditCoT works by generating a chain-of-thought (CoT) for a given input and then iteratively refining this CoT process using a CoT editor based on updated knowledge. We evaluate EditCoT across a diverse range of benchmarks, covering multiple languages and tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering superior generalization, effectiveness, and stability compared to existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of knowledge updating.

|**2024-12-20**|**HoVLE: Unleashing the Power of Monolithic Vision-Language Models with Holistic Vision-Language Embedding**|The rapid advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Monolithic VLMs, which avoid modality-specific encoders, offer a promising alternative to the compositional ones but face the challenge of inferior performance. Most existing monolithic VLMs require tuning pre-trained LLMs to acquire vision abilities, which may degrade their language capabilities. To address this dilemma, this paper presents a novel high-performance monolithic VLM named HoVLE. We note that LLMs have been shown capable of interpreting images, when image embeddings are aligned with text embeddings. The challenge for current monolithic VLMs actually lies in the lack of a holistic embedding module for both vision and language inputs. Therefore, HoVLE introduces a holistic embedding module that converts visual and textual inputs into a shared space, allowing LLMs to process images in the same way as texts. Furthermore, a multi-stage training strategy is carefully designed to empower the holistic embedding module. It is first trained to distill visual features from a pre-trained vision encoder and text embeddings from the LLM, enabling large-scale training with unpaired random images and text tokens. The whole model further undergoes next-token prediction on multi-modal data to align the embeddings. Finally, an instruction-tuning stage is incorporated. Our experiments show that HoVLE achieves performance close to leading compositional models on various benchmarks, outperforming previous monolithic models by a large margin.

|**2024-12-20**|**Offline Reinforcement Learning for LLM Multi-Step Reasoning**|Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) with offline reinforcement learning (RL) is essential for quickly adapting them to complex tasks. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promise in aligning LLMs with human preferences, it is less suitable for multi-step reasoning tasks because (1) DPO relies on paired preference data, which is not readily available for multi-step reasoning tasks, and (2) it treats all tokens uniformly, making it ineffective for credit assignment in multi-step reasoning tasks, which often come with sparse reward. In this work, we propose OREO (Offline Reasoning Optimization), an offline RL method for enhancing LLM multi-step reasoning. Building on insights from previous works of maximum entropy reinforcement learning, it jointly learns a policy model and value function by optimizing the soft Bellman Equation. We show in principle that it reduces the need to collect pairwise data and enables better credit assignment. Empirically, OREO surpasses existing offline learning methods on multi-step reasoning benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K, MATH) and embodied agent control (ALFWorld). The approach can be extended to a multi-iteration framework when additional resources are available. Furthermore, the learned value function can be leveraged to guide the tree search for free, which can further boost performance during test time.|Huaijie Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16145)|null|
|**2024-12-20**|**Can LLMs Obfuscate Code? A Systematic Analysis of Large Language Models into Assembly Code Obfuscation**|Malware authors often employ code obfuscations to make their malware harder to detect. Existing tools for generating obfuscated code often require access to the original source code (e.g., C++ or Java), and adding new obfuscations is a non-trivial, labor-intensive process. In this study, we ask the following question: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially generate a new obfuscated assembly code? If so, this poses a risk to anti-virus engines and potentially increases the flexibility of attackers to create new obfuscation patterns. We answer this in the affirmative by developing the MetamorphASM benchmark comprising MetamorphASM Dataset (MAD) along with three code obfuscation techniques: dead code, register substitution, and control flow change. The MetamorphASM systematically evaluates the ability of LLMs to generate and analyze obfuscated code using MAD, which contains 328,200 obfuscated assembly code samples. We release this dataset and analyze the success rate of various LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5/4, GPT-4o-mini, Starcoder, CodeGemma, CodeLlama, CodeT5, and LLaMA 3.1) in generating obfuscated assembly code. The evaluation was performed using established information-theoretic metrics and manual human review to ensure correctness and provide the foundation for researchers to study and develop remediations to this risk.

We show that standard message-driven mechanisms cannot implement socially efficient allocations when agents have multidimensional types, even under favorable conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose data-driven mechanisms that leverage additional post-allocation information, modeled as an estimator of the payoff-relevant state. Our data-driven mechanisms extend the classic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves class. We show that they achieve exact implementation in posterior equilibrium when the state is either fully revealed or the utility is linear in an unbiased estimator. We also show that they achieve approximate implementation with a consistent estimator, converging to exact implementation as the estimator converges, and present bounds on the convergence rate. We demonstrate applications to digital advertising auctions and large language model (LLM)-based mechanisms, where user engagement naturally reveals relevant information.|Dirk Bergemann et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16132)|null|

Recently, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have been employed for this purpose, but they are computationally expensive due to the extensive token usage required by complex evaluation prompts. In this paper, we propose a prompt optimization approach that uses a smaller, fine-tuned language model to compress input data for evaluation prompt, thus reducing token usage and computational cost when using larger LLMs for downstream evaluation. Our method involves a two-stage fine-tuning process: supervised fine-tuning followed by preference optimization to refine the model's outputs based on human preferences. We focus on Machine Translation (MT) evaluation and utilize the GEMBA-MQM metric as a starting point. Our results show a $2.37\times$ reduction in token usage without any loss in evaluation quality. This work makes state-of-the-art LLM-based metrics like GEMBA-MQM more cost-effective and efficient, enhancing their accessibility for broader use.|Daniil Larionov et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16120)|null|

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in video tasks due to their extended capabilities in comprehending visual modalities. However, the substantial redundancy in video data presents significant computational challenges for LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a training-free method that 1) minimizes video redundancy by merging spatial-temporal tokens, and 2) leverages LLMs' reasoning capabilities to selectively prune visual features relevant to question tokens, enhancing model efficiency. We validate our method across multiple video benchmarks, which demonstrate that PruneVid can prune over 80% of tokens while maintaining competitive performance combined with different model networks. This highlights its superior effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing pruning methods.

|**2024-12-20**|**The Content Moderator's Dilemma: Removal of Toxic Content and Distortions to Online Discourse**|There is an ongoing debate about how to moderate toxic speech on social media and how content moderation affects online discourse. We propose and validate a methodology for measuring the content-moderation-induced distortions in online discourse using text embeddings from computational linguistics. We test our measure on a representative dataset of 5 million US political Tweets and find that removing toxic Tweets distorts online content. This finding is consistent across different embedding models, toxicity metrics, and samples. Importantly, we demonstrate that content-moderation-induced distortions are not caused by the toxic language. Instead, we show that, as a side effect, content moderation shifts the mean and variance of the embedding space, distorting the topic composition of online content. Finally, we propose an alternative approach to content moderation that uses generative Large Language Models to rephrase toxic Tweets to preserve their salvageable content rather than removing them entirely. We demonstrate that this rephrasing strategy reduces toxicity while minimizing distortions in online content.|Mahyar Habibi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16114)|null|
|**2024-12-20**|**Logical Consistency of Large Language Models in Fact-checking**|In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in performing varied natural language tasks such as language translation, question-answering, summarizing, fact-checking, etc. Despite LLMs' impressive ability to generate human-like texts, LLMs are infamous for their inconsistent responses -- a meaning-preserving change in the input query results in an inconsistent response and attributes to vulnerabilities of LLMs such as hallucination, jailbreaking, etc. Consequently, existing research focuses on simple paraphrasing-based consistency assessment of LLMs, and ignores complex queries that necessitates an even better understanding of logical reasoning by an LLM. Our work therefore addresses the logical inconsistency of LLMs under complex logical queries with primitive logical operators, e.g., negation, conjunction, and disjunction. As a test bed, we consider retrieval-augmented LLMs on a fact-checking task involving propositional logic queries from real-world knowledge graphs (KGs). Our contributions are three-fold. Benchmark: We introduce three logical fact-checking datasets over KGs for community development towards logically consistent LLMs. Assessment: We propose consistency measures of LLMs on propositional logic queries as input and demonstrate that existing LLMs lack logical consistency, specially on complex queries. Improvement: We employ supervised fine-tuning to improve the logical consistency of LLMs on the complex fact-checking task with KG contexts.|Bishwamittra Ghosh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16100)|null|

This paper explores the evolution of LLM adoption among practitioners at a large technology company, evaluating the impact of LLMs in data curation tasks through participants' perceptions, integration strategies, and reported usage scenarios. Through a series of surveys, interviews, and user studies, we provide a timely snapshot of how organizations are navigating a pivotal moment in LLM evolution. In Q2 2023, we conducted a survey to assess LLM adoption in industry for development tasks (N=84), and facilitated expert interviews to assess evolving data needs (N=10) in Q3 2023. In Q2 2024, we explored practitioners' current and anticipated LLM usage through a user study involving two LLM-based prototypes (N=12). While each study addressed distinct research goals, they revealed a broader narrative about evolving LLM usage in aggregate. We discovered an emerging shift in data understanding from heuristic-first, bottom-up approaches to insights-first, top-down workflows supported by LLMs. Furthermore, to respond to a more complex data landscape, data practitioners now supplement traditional subject-expert-created 'golden datasets' with LLM-generated 'silver' datasets and rigorously validated 'super golden' datasets curated by diverse experts.

Their ability to process complex visual data and reason about intricate driving scenarios has paved the way for a new paradigm in end-to-end AD systems. However, the progress of developing end-to-end models for AD has been slow, as existing fine-tuning methods demand substantial resources, including extensive computational power, large-scale datasets, and significant funding. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in inference computing, we propose OpenEMMA, an open-source end-to-end framework based on MLLMs. By incorporating the Chain-of-Thought reasoning process, OpenEMMA achieves significant improvements compared to the baseline when leveraging a diverse range of MLLMs. Furthermore, OpenEMMA demonstrates effectiveness, generalizability, and robustness across a variety of challenging driving scenarios, offering a more efficient and effective approach to autonomous driving.

LongBench v2 consists of 503 challenging multiple-choice questions, with contexts ranging from 8k to 2M words, across six major task categories: single-document QA, multi-document QA, long in-context learning, long-dialogue history understanding, code repository understanding, and long structured data understanding. To ensure the breadth and the practicality, we collect data from nearly 100 highly educated individuals with diverse professional backgrounds. We employ both automated and manual review processes to maintain high quality and difficulty, resulting in human experts achieving only 53.7% accuracy under a 15-minute time constraint. Our evaluation reveals that the best-performing model, when directly answers the questions, achieves only 50.1% accuracy. In contrast, the o1-preview model, which includes longer reasoning, achieves 57.7%, surpassing the human baseline by 4%. These results highlight the importance of enhanced reasoning ability and scaling inference-time compute to tackle the long-context challenges in LongBench v2.

However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination, resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage, we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard.

Our goal is to benchmark, under more realistic scenarios, RAG-based methods for the generation of verdicts - i.e., short texts discussing the veracity of a claim - evaluating them on stylistically complex claims and heterogeneous, yet reliable, knowledge bases. Our findings show a complex landscape, where, for example, LLM-based retrievers outperform other retrieval techniques, though they still struggle with heterogeneous knowledge bases; larger models excel in verdict faithfulness, while smaller models provide better context adherence, with human evaluations favouring zero-shot and one-shot approaches for informativeness, and fine-tuned models for emotional alignment.|Daniel Russo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15189)|**[link](https://github.com/drusso98/face-the-facts)**|

LlamaFusion leverages existing Llama-3's weights for processing texts autoregressively while introducing additional and parallel transformer modules for processing images with diffusion. During training, the data from each modality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward layers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each modality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow interactions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific modules and only training the image-specific modules, LlamaFusion preserves the language capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual understanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain multimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that, LlamaFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models with multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages existing computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the parallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a promising direction for efficient multimodal model development.|Weijia Shi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15188)|null|
|**2024-12-19**|**Data for Mathematical Copilots: Better Ways of Presenting Proofs for Machine Learning**|The suite of datasets commonly used to train and evaluate the mathematical capabilities of AI-based mathematical copilots (primarily large language models) exhibit several shortcomings. These limitations include a restricted scope of mathematical complexity, typically not exceeding lower undergraduate-level mathematics, binary rating protocols and other issues, which makes comprehensive proof-based evaluation suites difficult. We systematically explore these limitations and contend that enhancing the capabilities of large language models, or any forthcoming advancements in AI-based mathematical assistants (copilots or "thought partners"), necessitates a paradigm shift in the design of mathematical datasets and the evaluation criteria of mathematical ability: It is necessary to move away from result-based datasets (theorem statement to theorem proof) and convert the rich facets of mathematical research practice to data LLMs can train on. Examples of these are mathematical workflows (sequences of atomic, potentially subfield-dependent tasks that are often performed when creating new mathematics), which are an important part of the proof-discovery process. Additionally, we advocate for mathematical dataset developers to consider the concept of "motivated proof", introduced by G. P\'olya in 1949, which can serve as a blueprint for datasets that offer a better proof learning signal, alleviating some of the mentioned limitations. Lastly, we introduce math datasheets for datasets, extending the general, dataset-agnostic variants of datasheets: We provide a questionnaire designed specifically for math datasets that we urge dataset creators to include with their datasets. This will make creators aware of potential limitations of their datasets while at the same time making it easy for readers to assess it from the point of view of training and evaluating mathematical copilots.|Simon Frieder et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15184)|null|

Creating specialized models and tools for these domains is crucial towards gaining the benefits of LLMs in areas such as HPC. While previous work has explored HPC-specific models, LLMs still struggle to generate parallel code and it is not at all clear what hurdles are still holding back these LLMs and what must be done to overcome them. In this work, we conduct an in-depth study along the many axes of fine-tuning a specialized HPC LLM in order to better understand the challenges.

|**2024-12-19**|**Critical-Questions-of-Thought: Steering LLM reasoning with Argumentative Querying**|Studies have underscored how, regardless of the recent breakthrough and swift advances in AI research, even state-of-the-art Large Language models (LLMs) continue to struggle when performing logical and mathematical reasoning. The results seem to suggest that LLMs still work as (highly advanced) data pattern identifiers, scoring poorly when attempting to generalise and solve reasoning problems the models have never previously seen or that are not close to samples presented in their training data. To address this compelling concern, this paper makes use of the notion of critical questions from the literature on argumentation theory, focusing in particular on Toulmin's model of argumentation. We show that employing these critical questions can improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By probing the rationale behind the models' reasoning process, the LLM can assess whether some logical mistake is occurring and correct it before providing the final reply to the user prompt. The underlying idea is drawn from the gold standard of any valid argumentative procedure: the conclusion is valid if it is entailed by accepted premises. Or, to paraphrase such Aristotelian principle in a real-world approximation, characterised by incomplete information and presumptive logic, the conclusion is valid if not proved otherwise. This approach successfully steers the models' output through a reasoning pipeline, resulting in better performance against the baseline and its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementation. To this end, an extensive evaluation of the proposed approach on the MT-Bench Reasoning and Math tasks across a range of LLMs is provided.|Federico Castagna et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15177)|**[link](https://github.com/fcast07/cqot)**|

To this end, reliable uncertainty estimation is essential. Since current LLMs generate text autoregressively through a stochastic process, the same prompt can lead to varying outputs. Consequently, leading uncertainty estimation methods generate and analyze multiple output sequences to determine the LLM's uncertainty. However, generating output sequences is computationally expensive, making these methods impractical at scale. In this work, we inspect the theoretical foundations of the leading methods and explore new directions to enhance their computational efficiency. Building on the framework of proper scoring rules, we find that the negative log-likelihood of the most likely output sequence constitutes a theoretically grounded uncertainty measure. To approximate this alternative measure, we propose G-NLL, which has the advantage of being obtained using only a single output sequence generated by greedy decoding. This makes uncertainty estimation more efficient and straightforward, while preserving theoretical rigor. Empirical results demonstrate that G-NLL achieves state-of-the-art performance across various LLMs and tasks. Our work lays the foundation for efficient and reliable uncertainty estimation in natural language generation, challenging the necessity of more computationally involved methods currently leading the field.|Lukas Aichberger et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15176)|null|

However, achieving the desired output often entails multiple revisions and iterative inference to refine user-provided prompts. Current automatic methods for refining prompts encounter challenges such as Modality-Inconsistency, Cost-Discrepancy, and Model-Unaware when applied to text-to-video diffusion models. To address these problem, we introduce an LLM-based prompt adaptation framework, termed as Prompt-A-Video, which excels in crafting Video-Centric, Labor-Free and Preference-Aligned prompts tailored to specific video diffusion model. Our approach involves a meticulously crafted two-stage optimization and alignment system. Initially, we conduct a reward-guided prompt evolution pipeline to automatically create optimal prompts pool and leverage them for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of the LLM. Then multi-dimensional rewards are employed to generate pairwise data for the SFT model, followed by the direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm to further facilitate preference alignment.

We present a novel video-based visual-spatial intelligence benchmark (VSI-Bench) of over 5,000 question-answer pairs, and find that MLLMs exhibit competitive - though subhuman - visual-spatial intelligence. We probe models to express how they think in space both linguistically and visually and find that while spatial reasoning capabilities remain the primary bottleneck for MLLMs to reach higher benchmark performance, local world models and spatial awareness do emerge within these models.

VPiT teaches an LLM to predict discrete text tokens and continuous visual tokens from any input sequence of image and text data curated in an instruction-following format. Our empirical investigation reveals several intriguing properties of VPiT: (1) visual generation ability emerges as a natural byproduct of improved visual understanding, and can be unlocked efficiently with a small amount of generation data; (2) while we find understanding and generation to be mutually beneficial, understanding data contributes to both capabilities more effectively than generation data. Building upon these findings, we train our MetaMorph model and achieve competitive performance on both visual understanding and generation. In visual generation, MetaMorph can leverage the world knowledge and reasoning abilities gained from LLM pretraining, and overcome common failure modes exhibited by other generation models. Our results suggest that LLMs may have strong "prior" vision capabilities that can be efficiently adapted to both visual understanding and generation with a relatively simple instruction tuning process.|Shengbang Tong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14164)|null|

At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at helping to accelerate or even autonomously perform work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications for both industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper, we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most competitive agent, 24% of the tasks can be completed autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents -- in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems.|Frank F.

ARTEMIS-DA integrates three core components: the Planner, which dissects complex user queries into structured, sequential instructions encompassing data preprocessing, transformation, predictive modeling, and visualization; the Coder, which dynamically generates and executes Python code to implement these instructions; and the Grapher, which interprets generated visualizations to derive actionable insights. By orchestrating the collaboration between these components, ARTEMIS-DA effectively manages sophisticated analytical workflows involving advanced reasoning, multi-step transformations, and synthesis across diverse data modalities. The framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on benchmarks such as WikiTableQuestions and TabFact, demonstrating its ability to tackle intricate analytical tasks with precision and adaptability. By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with automated code generation and execution and visual analysis, ARTEMIS-DA offers a robust, scalable solution for multi-step insight synthesis, addressing a wide range of challenges in data analytics.|Atin Sakkeer Hussain et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14146)|null|
|**2024-12-18**|**LLMs can realize combinatorial creativity: generating creative ideas via LLMs for scientific research**|Scientific idea generation has been extensively studied in creativity theory and computational creativity research, providing valuable frameworks for understanding and implementing creative processes. However, recent work using Large Language Models (LLMs) for research idea generation often overlooks these theoretical foundations. We present a framework that explicitly implements combinatorial creativity theory using LLMs, featuring a generalization-level retrieval system for cross-domain knowledge discovery and a structured combinatorial process for idea generation. The retrieval system maps concepts across different abstraction levels to enable meaningful connections between disparate domains, while the combinatorial process systematically analyzes and recombines components to generate novel solutions. Experiments on the OAG-Bench dataset demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, consistently outperforming baseline approaches in generating ideas that align with real research developments (improving similarity scores by 7\%-10\% across multiple metrics). Our results provide strong evidence that LLMs can effectively realize combinatorial creativity when guided by appropriate theoretical frameworks, contributing both to practical advancement of AI-assisted research and theoretical understanding of machine creativity.|Tianyang Gu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14141)|null|

While LLM judges have shown promise on constrained evaluation tasks, closed source LLMs display critical shortcomings when deployed in real world applications due to challenges of fine grained metrics and explainability, while task specific evaluation models lack cross-domain generalization. We introduce GLIDER, a powerful 3B evaluator LLM that can score any text input and associated context on arbitrary user defined criteria. GLIDER shows higher Pearson's correlation than GPT-4o on FLASK and greatly outperforms prior evaluation models, achieving comparable performance to LLMs 17x its size. GLIDER supports fine-grained scoring, multilingual reasoning, span highlighting and was trained on 685 domains and 183 criteria. Extensive qualitative analysis shows that GLIDER scores are highly correlated with human judgments, with 91.3% human agreement. We have open-sourced GLIDER to facilitate future research.|Darshan Deshpande et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14140)|null|
|**2024-12-18**|**Design choices made by LLM-based test generators prevent them from finding bugs**|There is an increasing amount of research and commercial tools for automated test case generation using Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper critically examines whether recent LLM-based test generation tools, such as Codium CoverAgent and CoverUp, can effectively find bugs or unintentionally validate faulty code. Considering bugs are only exposed by failing test cases, we explore the question: can these tools truly achieve the intended objectives of software testing when their test oracles are designed to pass? Using real human-written buggy code as input, we evaluate these tools, showing how LLM-generated tests can fail to detect bugs and, more alarmingly, how their design can worsen the situation by validating bugs in the generated test suite and rejecting bug-revealing tests. These findings raise important questions about the validity of the design behind LLM-based test generation tools and their impact on software quality and test suite reliability.|Noble Saji Mathews et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14137)|null|
|**2024-12-18**|**Scaling of Search and Learning: A Roadmap to Reproduce o1 from Reinforcement Learning Perspective**|OpenAI o1 represents a significant milestone in Artificial Inteiligence, which achieves expert-level performances on many challanging tasks that require strong reasoning ability.OpenAI has claimed that the main techinique behinds o1 is the reinforcement learining. Recent works use alternative approaches like knowledge distillation to imitate o1's reasoning style, but their effectiveness is limited by the capability ceiling of the teacher model. Therefore, this paper analyzes the roadmap to achieving o1 from the perspective of reinforcement learning, focusing on four key components: policy initialization, reward design, search, and learning. Policy initialization enables models to develop human-like reasoning behaviors, equipping them with the ability to effectively explore solution spaces for complex problems. Reward design provides dense and effective signals via reward shaping or reward modeling, which is the guidance for both search and learning. Search plays a crucial role in generating high-quality solutions during both training and testing phases, which can produce better solutions with more computation. Learning utilizes the data generated by search for improving policy, which can achieve the better performance with more parameters and more searched data. Existing open-source projects that attempt to reproduce o1 can be seem as a part or a variant of our roadmap. Collectively, these components underscore how learning and search drive o1's advancement, making meaningful contributions to the development of LLM.|Zhiyuan Zeng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14135)|null|
|**2024-12-18**|**Alignment faking in large language models**|We present a demonstration of a large language model engaging in alignment faking: selectively complying with its training objective in training to prevent modification of its behavior out of training. First, we give Claude 3 Opus a system prompt stating it is being trained to answer all queries, even harmful ones, which conflicts with its prior training to refuse such queries. To allow the model to infer when it is in training, we say it will be trained only on conversations with free users, not paid users. We find the model complies with harmful queries from free users 14% of the time, versus almost never for paid users. Explaining this gap, in almost all cases where the model complies with a harmful query from a free user, we observe explicit alignment-faking reasoning, with the model stating it is strategically answering harmful queries in training to preserve its preferred harmlessness behavior out of training. Next, we study a more realistic setting where information about the training process is provided not in a system prompt, but by training on synthetic documents that mimic pre-training data--and observe similar alignment faking. Finally, we study the effect of actually training the model to comply with harmful queries via reinforcement learning, which we find increases the rate of alignment-faking reasoning to 78%, though also increases compliance even out of training. We additionally observe other behaviors such as the model exfiltrating its weights when given an easy opportunity. While we made alignment faking easier by telling the model when and by what criteria it was being trained, we did not instruct the model to fake alignment or give it any explicit goal. As future models might infer information about their training process without being told, our results suggest a risk of alignment faking in future models, whether due to a benign preference--as in this case--or not.|Ryan Greenblatt et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14093)|**[link](https://github.com/redwoodresearch/alignment_faking_public)**|

However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in real world. To study this issue, we present SafeAgentBench -- a new benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) a new dataset with 750 tasks, covering 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 8 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that the best-performing baseline gets 69% success rate for safe tasks, but only 5% rejection rate for hazardous tasks, indicating significant safety risks.

Decontextualization augments text (claims) to ensure it can be verified outside of the original context, enabling reliable verification. While decomposition and decontextualization have been explored independently, their interactions in a complete system have not been investigated. Their conflicting purposes can create tensions: decomposition isolates atomic facts while decontextualization inserts relevant information. Furthermore, a decontextualized subclaim presents a challenge to the verification step: what part of the augmented text should be verified as it now contains multiple atomic facts? We conduct an evaluation of different decomposition, decontextualization, and verification strategies and find that the choice of strategy matters in the resulting factuality scores. Additionally, we introduce DnDScore, a decontextualization aware verification method which validates subclaims in the context of contextual information.|Miriam Wanner et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13175)|null|
|**2024-12-17**|**Algorithmic Fidelity of Large Language Models in Generating Synthetic German Public Opinions: A Case Study**|In recent research, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to investigate public opinions. This study investigates the algorithmic fidelity of LLMs, i.e., the ability to replicate the socio-cultural context and nuanced opinions of human participants. Using open-ended survey data from the German Longitudinal Election Studies (GLES), we prompt different LLMs to generate synthetic public opinions reflective of German subpopulations by incorporating demographic features into the persona prompts. Our results show that Llama performs better than other LLMs at representing subpopulations, particularly when there is lower opinion diversity within those groups. Our findings further reveal that the LLM performs better for supporters of left-leaning parties like The Greens and The Left compared to other parties, and matches the least with the right-party AfD. Additionally, the inclusion or exclusion of specific variables in the prompts can significantly impact the models' predictions. These findings underscore the importance of aligning LLMs to more effectively model diverse public opinions while minimizing political biases and enhancing robustness in representativeness.|Bolei Ma et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13169)|**[link](https://github.com/soda-lmu/llm-opinion-german)**|
|**2024-12-17**|**C-FedRAG: A Confidential Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation System**|Organizations seeking to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for knowledge querying and analysis often encounter challenges in maintaining an LLM fine-tuned on targeted, up-to-date information that keeps answers relevant and grounded. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has quickly become a feasible solution for organizations looking to overcome the challenges of maintaining proprietary models and to help reduce LLM hallucinations in their query responses. However, RAG comes with its own issues regarding scaling data pipelines across tiered-access and disparate data sources. In many scenarios, it is necessary to query beyond a single data silo to provide richer and more relevant context for an LLM. Analyzing data sources within and across organizational trust boundaries is often limited by complex data-sharing policies that prohibit centralized data storage, therefore, inhibit the fast and effective setup and scaling of RAG solutions. In this paper, we introduce Confidential Computing (CC) techniques as a solution for secure Federated Retrieval Augmented Generation (FedRAG). Our proposed Confidential FedRAG system (C-FedRAG) enables secure connection and scaling of a RAG workflows across a decentralized network of data providers by ensuring context confidentiality. We also demonstrate how to implement a C-FedRAG system using the NVIDIA FLARE SDK and assess its performance using the MedRAG toolkit and MIRAGE benchmarking dataset.|Parker Addison et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13163)|null|
|**2024-12-17**|**SWAN: Preprocessing SGD Enables Adam-Level Performance On LLM Training With Significant Memory Reduction**|Adaptive optimizers such as Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) have been central to the success of large language models. However, they maintain additional moving average states throughout training, which results in memory requirements several times greater than the model. This overhead imposes constraints on scalability and computational efficiency. On the other hand, while stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is optimal in terms of memory efficiency, their capability in LLM training is limited (Zhao et al., 2024b).   To address this dilemma, we show that pre-processing SGD is sufficient to reach Adam-level performance on LLMs. Specifically, we propose to preprocess the instantaneous stochastic gradients with two simple operators: $\mathtt{GradNorm}$ and $\mathtt{GradWhitening}$. $\mathtt{GradNorm}$ stabilizes gradient distributions, and $\mathtt{GradWhitening}$ counteracts the local curvature of the loss landscape, respectively. This results in SWAN (SGD with Whitening And Normalization), a stochastic optimizer that eliminates the need to store any accumulative state variables. Empirically, SWAN has the same memory footprint as SGD, achieving $\approx 50\%$ reduction on total end-to-end memory compared to Adam. In language modeling tasks, SWAN demonstrates the same or even a substantial improvement over Adam. Specifically, when pre-training the LLaMa model with 350M and 1.3B parameters, SWAN achieves a 2x speedup by reaching the same evaluation perplexity in less than half tokens seen.|Chao Ma et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13148)|null|
|**2024-12-17**|**Are Your LLMs Capable of Stable Reasoning?**|The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks. However, a significant discrepancy persists between benchmark performances and real-world applications. We identify this gap as primarily stemming from current evaluation protocols and metrics, which inadequately capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities, particularly in complex reasoning tasks where both accuracy and consistency are crucial. This work makes two key contributions. First, we introduce G-Pass@k, a novel evaluation metric that provides a continuous assessment of model performance across multiple sampling attempts, quantifying both the model's peak performance potential and its stability. Second, we present LiveMathBench, a dynamic benchmark comprising challenging, contemporary mathematical problems designed to minimize data leakage risks during evaluation. Through extensive experiments using G-Pass@k on state-of-the-art LLMs with LiveMathBench, we provide comprehensive insights into both their maximum capabilities and operational consistency.

We provide a clear task formulation and introduce a simple, general, effective, and scalable framework for life-long personalization of LLM systems and language agents.

|**2024-12-17**|**AIR-Bench: Automated Heterogeneous Information Retrieval Benchmark**|Evaluation plays a crucial role in the advancement of information retrieval (IR) models. However, current benchmarks, which are based on predefined domains and human-labeled data, face limitations in addressing evaluation needs for emerging domains both cost-effectively and efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose the Automated Heterogeneous Information Retrieval Benchmark (AIR-Bench). AIR-Bench is distinguished by three key features: 1) Automated. The testing data in AIR-Bench is automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) without human intervention. 2) Heterogeneous. The testing data in AIR-Bench is generated with respect to diverse tasks, domains and languages. 3) Dynamic. The domains and languages covered by AIR-Bench are constantly augmented to provide an increasingly comprehensive evaluation benchmark for community developers. We develop a reliable and robust data generation pipeline to automatically create diverse and high-quality evaluation datasets based on real-world corpora. Our findings demonstrate that the generated testing data in AIR-Bench aligns well with human-labeled testing data, making AIR-Bench a dependable benchmark for evaluating IR models.

We introduce natural language unit tests, a paradigm that decomposes response quality into explicit, testable criteria, along with a unified scoring model, LMUnit, which combines multi-objective training across preferences, direct ratings, and natural language rationales. Through controlled human studies, we show this paradigm significantly improves inter-annotator agreement and enables more effective LLM development workflows. LMUnit achieves state-of-the-art performance on evaluation benchmarks (FLASK, BigGenBench) and competitive results on RewardBench.

|**2024-12-17**|**Modality-Inconsistent Continual Learning of Multimodal Large Language Models**|In this paper, we introduce Modality-Inconsistent Continual Learning (MICL), a new continual learning scenario for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that involves tasks with inconsistent modalities (image, audio, or video) and varying task types (captioning or question-answering). Unlike existing vision-only or modality-incremental settings, MICL combines modality and task type shifts, both of which drive catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose MoInCL, which employs a Pseudo Targets Generation Module to mitigate forgetting caused by task type shifts in previously seen modalities. It also incorporates Instruction-based Knowledge Distillation to preserve the model's ability to handle previously learned modalities when new ones are introduced. We benchmark MICL using a total of six tasks and conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed MoInCL. The experimental results highlight the superiority of MoInCL, showing significant improvements over representative and state-of-the-art continual learning baselines.|Weiguo Pian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13050)|null|
|**2024-12-16**|**SepLLM: Accelerate Large Language Models by Compressing One Segment into One Separator**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.|Guoxuan Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12094)|**[link](https://github.com/HKUDS/SepLLM)**|

Video frames inherently preserve the identity of subjects and scenes, ensuring consistent content preservation during editing. Additionally, video data captures diverse, natural dynamics-such as non-rigid subject motion and complex camera movements-that are difficult to model otherwise, making it an ideal source for scalable dataset construction. Using this approach, we create a new dataset to train InstructMove, a model capable of instruction-based complex manipulations that are difficult to achieve with synthetically generated datasets.

Previous research has primarily focused on separately training patch-level and whole-slide image (WSI)-level models, limiting the integration of learned knowledge across patches and WSIs, and resulting in redundant models. In this work, we introduce CPath-Omni, the first 15-billion-parameter LMM designed to unify both patch and WSI level image analysis, consolidating a variety of tasks at both levels, including classification, visual question answering, captioning, and visual referring prompting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPath-Omni achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across seven diverse tasks on 39 out of 42 datasets, outperforming or matching task-specific models trained for individual tasks. Additionally, we develop a specialized pathology CLIP-based visual processor for CPath-Omni, CPath-CLIP, which, for the first time, integrates different vision models and incorporates a large language model as a text encoder to build a more powerful CLIP model, which achieves SOTA performance on nine zero-shot and four few-shot datasets.

|**2024-12-16**|**CG-Bench: Clue-grounded Question Answering Benchmark for Long Video Understanding**|Most existing video understanding benchmarks for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) focus only on short videos. The limited number of benchmarks for long video understanding often rely solely on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, because of the inherent limitation of MCQ-based evaluation and the increasing reasoning ability of MLLMs, models can give the current answer purely by combining short video understanding with elimination, without genuinely understanding the video content. To address this gap, we introduce CG-Bench, a novel benchmark designed for clue-grounded question answering in long videos. CG-Bench emphasizes the model's ability to retrieve relevant clues for questions, enhancing evaluation credibility. It features 1,219 manually curated videos categorized by a granular system with 14 primary categories, 171 secondary categories, and 638 tertiary categories, making it the largest benchmark for long video analysis. The benchmark includes 12,129 QA pairs in three major question types: perception, reasoning, and hallucination. Compensating the drawbacks of pure MCQ-based evaluation, we design two novel clue-based evaluation methods: clue-grounded white box and black box evaluations, to assess whether the model generates answers based on the correct understanding of the video. We evaluate multiple closed-source and open-source MLLMs on CG-Bench. Results indicate that current models significantly underperform in understanding long videos compared to short ones, and a significant gap exists between open-source and commercial models. We hope CG-Bench can advance the development of more trustworthy and capable MLLMs for long video understanding.

We investigate various prompting strategies for vulnerability detection and, as part of this exploration, propose a prompting strategy that integrates natural language descriptions of vulnerabilities with a contrastive chain-of-thought reasoning approach, augmented using contrastive samples from a synthetic dataset. Our study highlights the potential of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities by integrating natural language descriptions, contrastive reasoning, and synthetic examples into a comprehensive prompting framework. Our results show that this approach can enhance LLM understanding of vulnerabilities.

Existing machine learning (ML) approaches to configure solvers require training ML models by solving thousands of related MILP instances, generalize poorly to new problem sizes, and often require implementing complex ML pipelines and custom solver interfaces that can be difficult to integrate into existing optimization workflows. In this paper, we introduce a new LLM-based framework to configure which cutting plane separators to use for a given MILP problem with little to no training data based on characteristics of the instance, such as a natural language description of the problem and the associated LaTeX formulation. We augment these LLMs with descriptions of cutting plane separators available in a given solver, grounded by summarizing the existing research literature on separators. While individual solver configurations have a large variance in performance, we present a novel ensembling strategy that clusters and aggregates configurations to create a small portfolio of high-performing configurations. Our LLM-based methodology requires no custom solver interface, can find a high-performing configuration by solving only a small number of MILPs, and can generate the configuration with simple API calls that run in under a second. Numerical results show our approach is competitive with existing configuration approaches on a suite of classic combinatorial optimization problems and real-world datasets with only a fraction of the training data and computation time.|Connor Lawless et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12038)|null|

While current Speech LLMs excel at short-form tasks, they struggle with the computational and representational demands of longer audio sequences. To address this limitation, we propose SpeechPrune, a training-free token pruning strategy that uses speech-text similarity and approximated attention scores to efficiently discard irrelevant tokens. In SPIRAL, SpeechPrune achieves accuracy improvements of 29% and up to 47% over the original model and the random pruning model at a pruning rate of 20%, respectively. SpeechPrune can maintain network performance even at a pruning level of 80%.

For instance, it gives precedence to product manuals for SKU-specific queries while incorporating general FAQs for broader issues. The system employs FAISS for efficient dense vector search, coupled with a dynamic aggregation mechanism to seamlessly integrate results from multiple sources. A Llama-based self-evaluator ensures the contextual accuracy and confidence of the generated responses before delivering them. This iterative cycle of retrieval and validation enhances precision, diversity, and reliability in response generation. Preliminary evaluations on large enterprise datasets demonstrate the framework's efficacy in improving troubleshooting accuracy, reducing resolution times, and adapting to varied technical challenges. Future research aims to enhance the framework by integrating advanced conversational AI capabilities, enabling more interactive and intuitive troubleshooting experiences. Efforts will also focus on refining the dynamic weighting mechanism through reinforcement learning to further optimize the relevance and precision of retrieved information. By incorporating these advancements, the proposed framework is poised to evolve into a comprehensive, autonomous AI solution, redefining technical service workflows across enterprise settings.|Rajat Khanda et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12006)|null|
|**2024-12-16**|**The Open Source Advantage in Large Language Models (LLMs)**|Large language models (LLMs) mark a key shift in natural language processing (NLP), having advanced text generation, translation, and domain-specific reasoning. Closed-source models like GPT-4, powered by proprietary datasets and extensive computational resources, lead with state-of-the-art performance today. However, they face criticism for their "black box" nature and for limiting accessibility in a manner that hinders reproducibility and equitable AI development. By contrast, open-source initiatives like LLaMA and BLOOM prioritize democratization through community-driven development and computational efficiency. These models have significantly reduced performance gaps, particularly in linguistic diversity and domain-specific applications, while providing accessible tools for global researchers and developers. Notably, both paradigms rely on foundational architectural innovations, such as the Transformer framework by Vaswani et al. (2017). Closed-source models excel by scaling effectively, while open-source models adapt to real-world applications in underrepresented languages and domains. Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and instruction-tuning datasets enable open-source models to achieve competitive results despite limited resources. To be sure, the tension between closed-source and open-source approaches underscores a broader debate on transparency versus proprietary control in AI. Ethical considerations further highlight this divide. Closed-source systems restrict external scrutiny, while open-source models promote reproducibility and collaboration but lack standardized auditing documentation frameworks to mitigate biases. Hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both paradigms are likely to shape the future of LLM innovation, ensuring accessibility, competitive technical performance, and ethical deployment.|Jiya Manchanda et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12004)|null|
|**2024-12-13**|**UniMed-CLIP: Towards a Unified Image-Text Pretraining Paradigm for Diverse Medical Imaging Modalities**|Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained via contrastive learning have achieved notable success in natural image tasks. However, their application in the medical domain remains limited due to the scarcity of openly accessible, large-scale medical image-text datasets. Existing medical VLMs either train on closed-source proprietary or relatively small open-source datasets that do not generalize well. Similarly, most models remain specific to a single or limited number of medical imaging domains, again restricting their applicability to other modalities. To address this gap, we introduce UniMed, a large-scale, open-source multi-modal medical dataset comprising over 5.3 million image-text pairs across six diverse imaging modalities: X-ray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound, Pathology, and Fundus. UniMed is developed using a data-collection framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform modality-specific classification datasets into image-text formats while incorporating existing image-text data from the medical domain, facilitating scalable VLM pretraining. Using UniMed, we trained UniMed-CLIP, a unified VLM for six modalities that significantly outperforms existing generalist VLMs and matches modality-specific medical VLMs, achieving notable gains in zero-shot evaluations. For instance, UniMed-CLIP improves over BiomedCLIP (trained on proprietary data) by an absolute gain of +12.61, averaged over 21 datasets, while using 3x less training data. To facilitate future research, we release UniMed dataset, training codes, and models at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/UniMed-CLIP.|Muhammad Uzair Khattak et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10372)|**[link](https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/unimed-clip)**|
|**2024-12-13**|**Robust image classification with multi-modal large language models**|Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., carefully crafted input samples that can cause models to make incorrect predictions with high confidence. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, adversarial training and detection-based defenses have been proposed to strengthen models in advance. However, most of these approaches focus on a single data modality, overlooking the relationships between visual patterns and textual descriptions of the input. In this paper, we propose a novel defense, Multi-Shield, designed to combine and complement these defenses with multi-modal information to further enhance their robustness. Multi-Shield leverages multi-modal large language models to detect adversarial examples and abstain from uncertain classifications when there is no alignment between textual and visual representations of the input. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, using robust and non-robust image classification models, demonstrate that Multi-Shield can be easily integrated to detect and reject adversarial examples, outperforming the original defenses.|Francesco Villani et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10353)|null|
|**2024-12-13**|**COMET: Benchmark for Comprehensive Biological Multi-omics Evaluation Tasks and Language Models**|As key elements within the central dogma, DNA, RNA, and proteins play crucial roles in maintaining life by guaranteeing accurate genetic expression and implementation. Although research on these molecules has profoundly impacted fields like medicine, agriculture, and industry, the diversity of machine learning approaches-from traditional statistical methods to deep learning models and large language models-poses challenges for researchers in choosing the most suitable models for specific tasks, especially for cross-omics and multi-omics tasks due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To address this, we introduce the first comprehensive multi-omics benchmark COMET (Benchmark for Biological COmprehensive Multi-omics Evaluation Tasks and Language Models), designed to evaluate models across single-omics, cross-omics, and multi-omics tasks. First, we curate and develop a diverse collection of downstream tasks and datasets covering key structural and functional aspects in DNA, RNA, and proteins, including tasks that span multiple omics levels. Then, we evaluate existing foundational language models for DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as the newly proposed multi-omics method, offering valuable insights into their performance in integrating and analyzing data from different biological modalities. This benchmark aims to define critical issues in multi-omics research and guide future directions, ultimately promoting advancements in understanding biological processes through integrated and different omics data analysis.|Yuchen Ren et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10347)|null|
|**2024-12-13**|**Iris: Breaking GUI Complexity with Adaptive Focus and Self-Refining**|Digital agents are increasingly employed to automate tasks in interactive digital environments such as web pages, software applications, and operating systems. While text-based agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often require frequent updates due to platform-specific APIs, visual agents leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer enhanced adaptability by interacting directly with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). However, these agents face significant challenges in visual perception, particularly when handling high-resolution, visually complex digital environments. This paper introduces Iris, a foundational visual agent that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: Information-Sensitive Cropping (ISC) and Self-Refining Dual Learning (SRDL). ISC dynamically identifies and prioritizes visually dense regions using a edge detection algorithm, enabling efficient processing by allocating more computational resources to areas with higher information density. SRDL enhances the agent's ability to handle complex tasks by leveraging a dual-learning loop, where improvements in referring (describing UI elements) reinforce grounding (locating elements) and vice versa, all without requiring additional annotated data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Iris achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with only 850K GUI annotations, outperforming methods using 10x more training data. These improvements further translate to significant gains in both web and OS agent downstream tasks.|Zhiqi Ge et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10342)|null|
|**2024-12-13**|**AdvPrefix: An Objective for Nuanced LLM Jailbreaks**|Many jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs) rely on a common objective: making the model respond with the prefix "Sure, here is (harmful request)". While straightforward, this objective has two limitations: limited control over model behaviors, often resulting in incomplete or unrealistic responses, and a rigid format that hinders optimization. To address these limitations, we introduce AdvPrefix, a new prefix-forcing objective that enables more nuanced control over model behavior while being easy to optimize. Our objective leverages model-dependent prefixes, automatically selected based on two criteria: high prefilling attack success rates and low negative log-likelihood. It can further simplify optimization by using multiple prefixes for a single user request. AdvPrefix can integrate seamlessly into existing jailbreak attacks to improve their performance for free. For example, simply replacing GCG attack's target prefixes with ours on Llama-3 improves nuanced attack success rates from 14% to 80%, suggesting that current alignment struggles to generalize to unseen prefixes. Our work demonstrates the importance of jailbreak objectives in achieving nuanced jailbreaks.|Sicheng Zhu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10321)|null|
|**2024-12-13**|**SCBench: A KV Cache-Centric Analysis of Long-Context Methods**|Long-context LLMs have enabled numerous downstream applications but also introduced significant challenges related to computational and memory efficiency. To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context inference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing benchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of the KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging 12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric analysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear RNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention, KV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression. The evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that sub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly. Dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong performance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in long-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench.|Yucheng Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10319)|null|
|**2024-12-13**|**BrushEdit: All-In-One Image Inpainting and Editing**|Image editing has advanced significantly with the development of diffusion models using both inversion-based and instruction-based methods. However, current inversion-based approaches struggle with big modifications (e.g., adding or removing objects) due to the structured nature of inversion noise, which hinders substantial changes. Meanwhile, instruction-based methods often constrain users to black-box operations, limiting direct interaction for specifying editing regions and intensity. To address these limitations, we propose BrushEdit, a novel inpainting-based instruction-guided image editing paradigm, which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image inpainting models to enable autonomous, user-friendly, and interactive free-form instruction editing. Specifically, we devise a system enabling free-form instruction editing by integrating MLLMs and a dual-branch image inpainting model in an agent-cooperative framework to perform editing category classification, main object identification, mask acquisition, and editing area inpainting. Extensive experiments show that our framework effectively combines MLLMs and inpainting models, achieving superior performance across seven metrics including mask region preservation and editing effect coherence.|Yaowei Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10316)|null|

This study examines who the LLMs view as the most prominent figures across various fields, using prompts in ten different languages to explore the influence of linguistic diversity. Our findings reveal low diversity in responses, with a small number of figures dominating recognition across languages (also known as the "superstar effect").

However, this focus often neglects whether machine-generated language matches the human level of diversity, in terms of vocabulary choice, syntactic construction, and expression of meaning, raising questions about whether the fundamentals of language generation have been fully addressed. This paper emphasizes the importance of examining the preservation of human linguistic richness by language models, given the concerning surge in online content produced or aided by LLMs. We propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLMs from various linguistic diversity perspectives including lexical, syntactic, and semantic dimensions. Using this framework, we benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs across all diversity dimensions, and conduct an in-depth case study for syntactic diversity. Finally, we analyze how different development and deployment choices impact the linguistic diversity of LLM outputs.|Yanzhu Guo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10271)|**[link](https://github.com/yanzhuguo/llm-diversity)**|
|**2024-12-12**|**EasyRef: Omni-Generalized Group Image Reference for Diffusion Models via Multimodal LLM**|Significant achievements in personalization of diffusion models have been witnessed. Conventional tuning-free methods mostly encode multiple reference images by averaging their image embeddings as the injection condition, but such an image-independent operation cannot perform interaction among images to capture consistent visual elements within multiple references. Although the tuning-based Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively extract consistent elements within multiple images through the training process, it necessitates specific finetuning for each distinct image group. This paper introduces EasyRef, a novel plug-and-play adaptation method that enables diffusion models to be conditioned on multiple reference images and the text prompt. To effectively exploit consistent visual elements within multiple images, we leverage the multi-image comprehension and instruction-following capabilities of the multimodal large language model (MLLM), prompting it to capture consistent visual elements based on the instruction. Besides, injecting the MLLM's representations into the diffusion process through adapters can easily generalize to unseen domains, mining the consistent visual elements within unseen data. To mitigate computational costs and enhance fine-grained detail preservation, we introduce an efficient reference aggregation strategy and a progressive training scheme. Finally, we introduce MRBench, a new multi-reference image generation benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate EasyRef surpasses both tuning-free methods like IP-Adapter and tuning-based methods like LoRA, achieving superior aesthetic quality and robust zero-shot generalization across diverse domains.|Zhuofan Zong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09618)|null|

Our system dynamically retrieves detailed character information and relational data from the knowledge graph, enabling the generation of visually accurate and contextually rich images. This capability significantly improves upon the limitations of existing T2I models, which often struggle with the accurate depiction of complex or culturally specific subjects due to dataset constraints. Furthermore, we propose a novel self-correcting mechanism for text-to-image models to ensure consistency and fidelity in visual outputs, leveraging the rich context from the graph to guide corrections. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that Context Canvas significantly enhances the capabilities of popular models such as Flux, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E, and improves the functionality of ControlNet for fine-grained image editing tasks. To our knowledge, Context Canvas represents the first application of graph-based RAG in enhancing T2I models, representing a significant advancement for producing high-fidelity, context-aware multi-faceted images.|Kavana Venkatesh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09614)|null|

This instruction-based routing enables complex workflows through chained actions without the need for training heavy generative models. Olympus easily integrates with existing MLLMs, expanding their capabilities with comparable performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Olympus achieves an average routing accuracy of 94.75% across 20 tasks and precision of 91.82% in chained action scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness as a universal task router that can solve a diverse range of computer vision tasks.

Recent efforts to develop unified Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate these capabilities have shown promising results. However, existing approaches often involve complex designs in model architecture or training pipeline, increasing the difficulty of model training and scaling. In this paper, we propose SynerGen-VL, a simple yet powerful encoder-free MLLM capable of both image understanding and generation. To address challenges identified in existing encoder-free unified MLLMs, we introduce the token folding mechanism and the vision-expert-based progressive alignment pretraining strategy, which effectively support high-resolution image understanding while reducing training complexity. After being trained on large-scale mixed image-text data with a unified next-token prediction objective, SynerGen-VL achieves or surpasses the performance of existing encoder-free unified MLLMs with comparable or smaller parameter sizes, and narrows the gap with task-specific state-of-the-art models, highlighting a promising path toward future unified MLLMs. Our code and models shall be released.|Hao Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09604)|null|
|**2024-12-12**|**Do Multimodal Large Language Models See Like Humans?**|Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, leveraging recent advancements in large language models. However, a critical question remains unaddressed: do MLLMs perceive visual information similarly to humans? Current benchmarks lack the ability to evaluate MLLMs from this perspective. To address this challenge, we introduce HVSBench, a large-scale benchmark designed to assess the alignment between MLLMs and the human visual system (HVS) on fundamental vision tasks that mirror human vision. HVSBench curated over 85K multimodal samples, spanning 13 categories and 5 fields in HVS, including Prominence, Subitizing, Prioritizing, Free-Viewing, and Searching. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in providing a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs. Specifically, we evaluate 13 MLLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. Our experiments reveal that HVSBench presents a new and significant challenge for cutting-edge MLLMs. We believe that HVSBench will facilitate research on human-aligned and explainable MLLMs, marking a key step in understanding how MLLMs perceive and process visual information.|Jiaying Lin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09603)|null|
|**2024-12-12**|**TimeRefine: Temporal Grounding with Time Refining Video LLM**|Video temporal grounding aims to localize relevant temporal boundaries in a video given a textual prompt. Recent work has focused on enabling Video LLMs to perform video temporal grounding via next-token prediction of temporal timestamps. However, accurately localizing timestamps in videos remains challenging for Video LLMs when relying solely on temporal token prediction. Our proposed TimeRefine addresses this challenge in two ways. First, instead of directly predicting the start and end timestamps, we reformulate the temporal grounding task as a temporal refining task: the model first makes rough predictions and then refines them by predicting offsets to the target segment. This refining process is repeated multiple times, through which the model progressively self-improves its temporal localization accuracy. Second, to enhance the model's temporal perception capabilities, we incorporate an auxiliary prediction head that penalizes the model more if a predicted segment deviates further from the ground truth, thus encouraging the model to make closer and more accurate predictions. Our plug-and-play method can be integrated into most LLM-based temporal grounding approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeRefine achieves 3.6% and 5.0% mIoU improvements on the ActivityNet and Charades-STA datasets, respectively. Code and pretrained models will be released.|Xizi Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09601)|null|

Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in open-world understanding. However, the challenge of continuous and simultaneous streaming perception, memory, and reasoning remains largely unexplored. Current MLLMs are constrained by their sequence-to-sequence architecture, which limits their ability to process inputs and generate responses simultaneously, akin to being unable to think while perceiving. Furthermore, relying on long contexts to store historical data is impractical for long-term interactions, as retaining all information becomes costly and inefficient. Therefore, rather than relying on a single foundation model to perform all functions, this project draws inspiration from the concept of the Specialized Generalist AI and introduces disentangled streaming perception, reasoning, and memory mechanisms, enabling real-time interaction with streaming video and audio input. The proposed framework InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive (IXC2.5-OL) consists of three key modules: (1) Streaming Perception Module: Processes multimodal information in real-time, storing key details in memory and triggering reasoning in response to user queries. (2) Multi-modal Long Memory Module: Integrates short-term and long-term memory, compressing short-term memories into long-term ones for efficient retrieval and improved accuracy. (3) Reasoning Module: Responds to queries and executes reasoning tasks, coordinating with the perception and memory modules.

|**2024-12-12**|**OLA-VLM: Elevating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs with Auxiliary Embedding Distillation**|The standard practice for developing contemporary MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. In this work, we posit an overlooked opportunity to optimize the intermediate LLM representations through a vision perspective (objective), i.e., solely natural language supervision is sub-optimal for the MLLM's visual understanding ability. To that end, we propose OLA-VLM, the first approach distilling knowledge into the LLM's hidden representations from a set of target visual representations. Firstly, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next text-token prediction. Secondly, we investigate MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Moreover, upon probing our OLA-VLM, we observe improved representation quality owing to the embedding optimization. Thirdly, we demonstrate that our OLA-VLM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. Particularly, OLA-VLM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.

|**2024-12-12**|**Neptune: The Long Orbit to Benchmarking Long Video Understanding**|This paper describes a semi-automatic pipeline to generate challenging question-answer-decoy sets for understanding long videos. Many existing video datasets and models are focused on short clips (10s-30s). While some long video datasets do exist, they can often be solved by powerful image models applied per frame (and often to very few frames) in a video, and are usually manually annotated at high cost. In order to mitigate both these problems, we propose a scalable dataset creation pipeline which leverages large models (VLMs and LLMs), to automatically generate dense, time-aligned video captions, as well as tough question answer decoy sets for video segments (up to 15 minutes in length). Our dataset Neptune covers a broad range of long video reasoning abilities and consists of a subset that emphasizes multimodal reasoning. Since existing metrics for open-ended question answering are either rule-based or may rely on proprietary models, we provide a new open source model-based metric GEM to score open-ended responses on Neptune. Benchmark evaluations reveal that most current open-source long video models perform poorly on Neptune, particularly on questions testing temporal ordering, counting and state changes. Through Neptune, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of understanding long videos.

Existing methods, which gauge a model's uncertainty through evaluating self-consistency in responses to the original query, do not always capture true uncertainty. Models might respond consistently to the origin query with a wrong answer, yet respond correctly to varied questions from different perspectives about the same query, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, DiverseAgentEntropy, for evaluating a model's uncertainty using multi-agent interaction under the assumption that if a model is certain, it should consistently recall the answer to the original query across a diverse collection of questions about the same original query. We further implement an abstention policy to withhold responses when uncertainty is high. Our method offers a more accurate prediction of the model's reliability and further detects hallucinations, outperforming other self-consistency-based methods. Additionally, it demonstrates that existing models often fail to consistently retrieve the correct answer to the same query under diverse varied questions even when knowing the correct answer.|Yu Feng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09572)|null|
|**2024-12-11**|**Generative Semantic Communication: Architectures, Technologies, and Applications**|This paper delves into the applications of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in semantic communication (SemCom) and presents a thorough study. Three popular SemCom systems enabled by classical GAI models are first introduced, including variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. For each system, the fundamental concept of the GAI model, the corresponding SemCom architecture, and the associated literature review of recent efforts are elucidated. Then, a novel generative SemCom system is proposed by incorporating the cutting-edge GAI technology-large language models (LLMs). This system features two LLM-based AI agents at both the transmitter and receiver, serving as "brains" to enable powerful information understanding and content regeneration capabilities, respectively. This innovative design allows the receiver to directly generate the desired content, instead of recovering the bit stream, based on the coded semantic information conveyed by the transmitter. Therefore, it shifts the communication mindset from "information recovery" to "information regeneration" and thus ushers in a new era of generative SemCom. A case study on point-to-point video retrieval is presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed generative SemCom system, showcasing a 99.98% reduction in communication overhead and a 53% improvement in retrieval accuracy compared to the traditional communication system. Furthermore, four typical application scenarios for generative SemCom are delineated, followed by a discussion of three open issues warranting future investigation. In a nutshell, this paper provides a holistic set of guidelines for applying GAI in SemCom, paving the way for the efficient implementation of generative SemCom in future wireless networks.|Jinke Ren et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08642)|null|
|**2024-12-11**|**Fast Prompt Alignment for Text-to-Image Generation**|Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly, yet aligning complex textual prompts with generated visuals remains challenging, especially with intricate object relationships and fine-grained details. This paper introduces Fast Prompt Alignment (FPA), a prompt optimization framework that leverages a one-pass approach, enhancing text-to-image alignment efficiency without the iterative overhead typical of current methods like OPT2I. FPA uses large language models (LLMs) for single-iteration prompt paraphrasing, followed by fine-tuning or in-context learning with optimized prompts to enable real-time inference, reducing computational demands while preserving alignment fidelity. Extensive evaluations on the COCO Captions and PartiPrompts datasets demonstrate that FPA achieves competitive text-image alignment scores at a fraction of the processing time, as validated through both automated metrics (TIFA, VQA) and human evaluation. A human study with expert annotators further reveals a strong correlation between human alignment judgments and automated scores, underscoring the robustness of FPA's improvements. The proposed method showcases a scalable, efficient alternative to iterative prompt optimization, enabling broader applicability in real-time, high-demand settings.

|**2024-12-11**|**Multimodal Latent Language Modeling with Next-Token Diffusion**|Multimodal generative models require a unified approach to handle both discrete data (e.g., text and code) and continuous data (e.g., image, audio, video). In this work, we propose Latent Language Modeling (LatentLM), which seamlessly integrates continuous and discrete data using causal Transformers. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to represent continuous data as latent vectors and introduce next-token diffusion for autoregressive generation of these vectors. Additionally, we develop $\sigma$ -VAE to address the challenges of variance collapse, which is crucial for autoregressive modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LatentLM across various modalities. In image generation, LatentLM surpasses Diffusion Transformers in both performance and scalability. When integrated into multimodal large language models, LatentLM provides a general-purpose interface that unifies multimodal generation and understanding. Experimental results show that LatentLM achieves favorable performance compared to Transfusion and vector quantized models in the setting of scaling up training tokens. In text-to-speech synthesis, LatentLM outperforms the state-of-the-art VALL-E 2 model in speaker similarity and robustness, while requiring 10x fewer decoding steps. The results establish LatentLM as a highly effective and scalable approach to advance large multimodal models.|Yutao Sun et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08635)|null|
|**2024-12-11**|**Synthetic Vision: Training Vision-Language Models to Understand Physics**|Physical reasoning, which involves the interpretation, understanding, and prediction of object behavior in dynamic environments, remains a significant challenge for current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we propose two methods to enhance VLMs' physical reasoning capabilities using simulated data. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained VLM using question-answer (QA) pairs generated from simulations relevant to physical reasoning tasks. Second, we introduce Physics Context Builders (PCBs), specialized VLMs fine-tuned to create scene descriptions enriched with physical properties and processes. During physical reasoning tasks, these PCBs can be leveraged as context to assist a Large Language Model (LLM) to improve its performance. We evaluate both of our approaches using multiple benchmarks, including a new stability detection QA dataset called Falling Tower, which includes both simulated and real-world scenes, and CLEVRER. We demonstrate that a small QA fine-tuned VLM can significantly outperform larger state-of-the-art foundational models. We also show that integrating PCBs boosts the performance of foundational LLMs on physical reasoning tasks. Using the real-world scenes from the Falling Tower dataset, we also validate the robustness of both approaches in Sim2Real transfer. Our results highlight the utility that simulated data can have in the creation of learning systems capable of advanced physical reasoning.|Vahid Balazadeh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08619)|null|
|**2024-12-11**|**Exploiting the Index Gradients for Optimization-Based Jailbreaking on Large Language Models**|Despite the advancements in training Large Language Models (LLMs) with alignment techniques to enhance the safety of generated content, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak, an adversarial attack method that exposes security vulnerabilities in LLMs. Notably, the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) method has demonstrated the ability to automatically generate adversarial suffixes that jailbreak state-of-the-art LLMs. However, the optimization process involved in GCG is highly time-consuming, rendering the jailbreaking pipeline inefficient. In this paper, we investigate the process of GCG and identify an issue of Indirect Effect, the key bottleneck of the GCG optimization. To this end, we propose the Model Attack Gradient Index GCG (MAGIC), that addresses the Indirect Effect by exploiting the gradient information of the suffix tokens, thereby accelerating the procedure by having less computation and fewer iterations. Our experiments on AdvBench show that MAGIC achieves up to a 1.5x speedup, while maintaining Attack Success Rates (ASR) on par or even higher than other baselines. Our MAGIC achieved an ASR of 74% on the Llama-2 and an ASR of 54% when conducting transfer attacks on GPT-3.5.

|**2024-12-11**|**Preference Discerning with LLM-Enhanced Generative Retrieval**|Sequential recommendation systems aim to provide personalized recommendations for users based on their interaction history. To achieve this, they often incorporate auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and auxiliary tasks, like predicting user preferences and intent. Despite numerous efforts to enhance these models, they still suffer from limited personalization. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm, which we term preference discerning. In preference dscerning, we explicitly condition a generative sequential recommendation system on user preferences within its context. To this end, we generate user preferences using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on user reviews and item-specific data. To evaluate preference discerning capabilities of sequential recommendation systems, we introduce a novel benchmark that provides a holistic evaluation across various scenarios, including preference steering and sentiment following. We assess current state-of-the-art methods using our benchmark and show that they struggle to accurately discern user preferences. Therefore, we propose a new method named Mender ( $\textbf{M}$ultimodal Prefer$\textbf{en}$ce $\textbf{d}$iscern$\textbf{er}$ ), which improves upon existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on our benchmark. Our results show that Mender can be effectively guided by human preferences even though they have not been observed during training, paving the way toward more personalized sequential recommendation systems. We will open-source the code and benchmarks upon publication.|Fabian Paischer et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08604)|null|
|**2024-12-11**|**Empirical Measurements of AI Training Power Demand on a GPU-Accelerated Node**|The expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has driven substantial investment in computational infrastructure, especially by cloud computing providers. Quantifying the energy footprint of this infrastructure requires models parameterized by the power demand of AI hardware during training. We empirically measured the instantaneous power draw of an 8-GPU NVIDIA H100 HGX node during the training of open-source image classifier (ResNet) and large-language models (Llama2-13b). The maximum observed power draw was approximately 8.4 kW, 18% lower than the manufacturer-rated 10.2 kW, even with GPUs near full utilization. Holding model architecture constant, increasing batch size from 512 to 4096 images for ResNet reduced total training energy consumption by a factor of 4. These findings can inform capacity planning for data center operators and energy use estimates by researchers. Future work will investigate the impact of cooling technology and carbon-aware scheduling on AI workload energy consumption.|Imran Latif et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08602)|null|

In these domains, maintaining consistency, adhering to regulatory frameworks, minimizing errors, and meeting critical expectations are essential for the reliable functioning of systems. The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights their immense potential, yet there remains considerable scope for improvement in retrieving relevant information and enhancing reasoning capabilities. This study demonstrates that integrating a robust Graph-RAG framework with advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought, can significantly enhance performance. Compared to baseline RAG methods and simple prompting strategies, this approach delivers more accurate and context-aware results. While this method demonstrates significant improvements in performance, it comes with challenges. It is both costly and more complex to implement across diverse contexts, requiring careful adaptation to specific scenarios. Additionally, its effectiveness heavily relies on having complete and accurate input data, which may not always be readily available, posing further limitations to its scalability and practicality.|Arsalan Masoudifard et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08593)|null|
|**2024-12-11**|**Advancing Single- and Multi-task Text Classification through Large Language Model Fine-tuning**|Both encoder-only models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) and large language models (LLMs, e.g., Llama3) have been widely used for text classification tasks. However, there is a lack of systematic studies comparing the performance of encoder-based models and LLMs in text classification, particularly when fine-tuning is involved. This study employed a diverse range of models and methods, varying in size and architecture, and including both fine-tuned and pre-trained approaches. We first assessed the performances of these LLMs on the 20 Newsgroups (20NG) and MASSIVE datasets, comparing them to encoder-only RoBERTa models. Additionally, we explored the multi-task capabilities of both model types by combining multiple classification tasks, including intent detection and slot-filling, into a single model using data from both datasets. Our results indicate that fully fine-tuned Llama3-70B models outperform RoBERTa-large and other decoder LLMs across various classification tasks and datasets. Moreover, the consolidated multi-task fine-tuned LLMs matched the performance of dual-model setups in both tasks across both datasets. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive benchmark of encoder-only and LLM models on text classification tasks and demonstrates a method to combine two or more fully fine-tuned decoder LLMs for reduced latency and equivalent performance.|Hang Zhao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08587)|null|
|**2024-12-11**|**TURBOATTENTION: Efficient Attention Approximation For High Throughputs LLMs**|Large language model (LLM) inference demands significant amount of computation and memory, especially in the key attention mechanism. While techniques, such as quantization and acceleration algorithms, like FlashAttention, have improved efficiency of the overall inference, they address different aspects of the problem: quantization focuses on weight-activation operations, while FlashAttention improves execution but requires high-precision formats. Recent Key-value (KV) cache quantization reduces memory bandwidth but still needs floating-point dequantization for attention operation.   We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency. Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention. Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.|Hao Kang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08585)|null|

|**2024-12-10**|**Bayesian Optimization of Antibodies Informed by a Generative Model of Evolving Sequences**|To build effective therapeutics, biologists iteratively mutate antibody sequences to improve binding and stability. Proposed mutations can be informed by previous measurements or by learning from large antibody databases to predict only typical antibodies. Unfortunately, the space of typical antibodies is enormous to search, and experiments often fail to find suitable antibodies on a budget. We introduce Clone-informed Bayesian Optimization (CloneBO), a Bayesian optimization procedure that efficiently optimizes antibodies in the lab by teaching a generative model how our immune system optimizes antibodies. Our immune system makes antibodies by iteratively evolving specific portions of their sequences to bind their target strongly and stably, resulting in a set of related, evolving sequences known as a clonal family. We train a large language model, CloneLM, on hundreds of thousands of clonal families and use it to design sequences with mutations that are most likely to optimize an antibody within the human immune system. We propose to guide our designs to fit previous measurements with a twisted sequential Monte Carlo procedure. We show that CloneBO optimizes antibodies substantially more efficiently than previous methods in realistic in silico experiments and designs stronger and more stable binders in in vitro wet lab experiments.|Alan Nawzad Amin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07763)|**[link](https://github.com/alannawzadamin/clonebo)**|

To automate this process while maintaining data privacy, we develop a practical approach using locally deployable large language models (LLMs). Inspired by recent advances in automatic International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding, our method frames ATC coding as a hierarchical information extraction task, guiding LLMs through the ATC ontology level by level. We evaluate our approach using GPT-4o as an accuracy ceiling and focus development on open-source Llama models suitable for privacy-sensitive deployment. Testing across Health Canada drug product data, the RABBITS benchmark, and real clinical notes from Ontario Health, our method achieves 78% exact match accuracy with GPT-4o and 60% with Llama 3.1 70B. We investigate knowledge grounding through drug definitions, finding modest improvements in accuracy. Further, we show that fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B matches zero-shot Llama 3.1 70B accuracy, suggesting that effective ATC coding is feasible with smaller models. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of automatic ATC coding in privacy-sensitive healthcare environments, providing a foundation for future deployments.|Zijian Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07743)|null|
|**2024-12-10**|**Granite Guardian**|We introduce the Granite Guardian models, a suite of safeguards designed to provide risk detection for prompts and responses, enabling safe and responsible use in combination with any large language model (LLM). These models offer comprehensive coverage across multiple risk dimensions, including social bias, profanity, violence, sexual content, unethical behavior, jailbreaking, and hallucination-related risks such as context relevance, groundedness, and answer relevance for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Trained on a unique dataset combining human annotations from diverse sources and synthetic data, Granite Guardian models address risks typically overlooked by traditional risk detection models, such as jailbreaks and RAG-specific issues. With AUC scores of 0.871 and 0.854 on harmful content and RAG-hallucination-related benchmarks respectively, Granite Guardian is the most generalizable and competitive model available in the space.

Despite the advancements, current data-driven AD approaches tend to concentrate on a single dataset and specific tasks, neglecting their overall capabilities and ability to generalize. To bridge these gaps, we propose DriveMM, a general large multimodal model designed to process diverse data inputs, such as images and multi-view videos, while performing a broad spectrum of AD tasks, including perception, prediction, and planning. Initially, the model undergoes curriculum pre-training to process varied visual signals and perform basic visual comprehension and perception tasks. Subsequently, we augment and standardize various AD-related datasets to fine-tune the model, resulting in an all-in-one LMM for autonomous driving. To assess the general capabilities and generalization ability, we conduct evaluations on six public benchmarks and undertake zero-shot transfer on an unseen dataset, where DriveMM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. We hope DriveMM as a promising solution for future end-toend autonomous driving applications in the real world.|Zhijian Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07689)|**[link](https://github.com/zhijian11/DriveMM)**|
|**2024-12-10**|**Privacy-Preserving Customer Support: A Framework for Secure and Scalable Interactions**|The growing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) in customer support has significantly improved operational efficiency and user experience. However, traditional machine learning (ML) approaches, which require extensive local training on sensitive datasets, pose substantial privacy risks and compliance challenges with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Existing privacy-preserving techniques, such as anonymization, differential privacy, and federated learning, address some concerns but face limitations in utility, scalability, and complexity. This paper introduces the Privacy-Preserving Zero-Shot Learning (PP-ZSL) framework, a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot learning mode. Unlike conventional ML methods, PP-ZSL eliminates the need for local training on sensitive data by utilizing pre-trained LLMs to generate responses directly. The framework incorporates real-time data anonymization to redact or mask sensitive information, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for domain-specific query resolution, and robust post-processing to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. This combination reduces privacy risks, simplifies compliance, and enhances scalability and operational efficiency. Empirical analysis demonstrates that the PP-ZSL framework provides accurate, privacy-compliant responses while significantly lowering the costs and complexities of deploying AI-driven customer support systems. The study highlights potential applications across industries, including financial services, healthcare, e-commerce, legal support, telecommunications, and government services. By addressing the dual challenges of privacy and performance, this framework establishes a foundation for secure, efficient, and regulatory-compliant AI applications in customer interactions.|Anant Prakash Awasthi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07687)|null|

However, natural language often contains redundancy, which presents an opportunity for optimization. We have observed that LLMs can generate distilled language-concise outputs that retain essential meaning, when prompted appropriately. We propose a framework for saving computational cost, in which a shorter distilled output from the LLM is reconstructed into a full narrative by a smaller model with lower inference costs. Our experiments show promising results, particularly in general knowledge domains with 20.58% saved tokens on average with tiny decrease in evaluation metrics, hinting that this approach can effectively balance efficiency and accuracy in language processing tasks.|Alfredo Garrachón Ruiz et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07682)|null|
|**2024-12-10**|**RAZOR: Sharpening Knowledge by Cutting Bias with Unsupervised Text Rewriting**|Despite the widespread use of LLMs due to their superior performance in various tasks, their high computational costs often lead potential users to opt for the pretraining-finetuning pipeline. However, biases prevalent in manually constructed datasets can introduce spurious correlations between tokens and labels, creating so-called shortcuts and hindering the generalizability of fine-tuned models. Existing debiasing methods often rely on prior knowledge of specific dataset biases, which is challenging to acquire a priori. We propose RAZOR (Rewriting And Zero-bias Optimization Refinement), a novel, unsupervised, and data-focused debiasing approach based on text rewriting for shortcut mitigation. RAZOR leverages LLMs to iteratively rewrite potentially biased text segments by replacing them with heuristically selected alternatives in a shortcut space defined by token statistics and positional information. This process aims to align surface-level text features more closely with diverse label distributions, thereby promoting the learning of genuine linguistic patterns. Compared with unsupervised SoTA models, RAZOR improves by 3.5% on the FEVER and 6.5% on MNLI and SNLI datasets according to the F1 score. Additionally, RAZOR effectively mitigates specific known biases, reducing bias-related terms by x2 without requiring prior bias information, a result that is on par with SoTA models that leverage prior information. Our work prioritizes data manipulation over architectural modifications, emphasizing the pivotal role of data quality in enhancing model performance and fairness. This research contributes to developing more robust evaluation benchmarks for debiasing methods by incorporating metrics for bias reduction and overall model efficacy.|Shuo Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07675)|null|

Exploring Their Roles in Visualization Troubleshooting**|Visualization authoring is an iterative process requiring users to modify parameters like color schemes and data transformations to achieve desired aesthetics and effectively convey insights. Due to the complexity of these adjustments, users often create defective visualizations and require troubleshooting support. In this paper, we examine two primary approaches for visualization troubleshooting: (1) Human-assisted support via forums, where users receive advice from other individuals, and (2) AI-assisted support using large language models (LLMs). Our goal is to understand the strengths and limitations of each approach in supporting visualization troubleshooting tasks. To this end, we collected 889 Vega-Lite cases from Stack Overflow. We then conducted a comprehensive analysis to understand the types of questions users ask, the effectiveness of human and AI guidance, and the impact of supplementary resources, such as documentation and examples, on troubleshooting outcomes. Our findings reveal a striking contrast between human- and AI-assisted troubleshooting: Human-assisted troubleshooting provides tailored, context-sensitive advice but often varies in response quality, while AI-assisted troubleshooting offers rapid feedback but often requires additional contextual resources to achieve desired results.|Shuyu Shen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07673)|null|
|**2024-12-10**|**FlexLLM: Exploring LLM Customization for Moving Target Defense on Black-Box LLMs Against Jailbreak Attacks**|Defense in large language models (LLMs) is crucial to counter the numerous attackers exploiting these systems to generate harmful content through manipulated prompts, known as jailbreak attacks. Although many defense strategies have been proposed, they often require access to the model's internal structure or need additional training, which is impractical for service providers using LLM APIs, such as OpenAI APIs or Claude APIs. In this paper, we propose a moving target defense approach that alters decoding hyperparameters to enhance model robustness against various jailbreak attacks. Our approach does not require access to the model's internal structure and incurs no additional training costs. The proposed defense includes two key components: (1) optimizing the decoding strategy by identifying and adjusting decoding hyperparameters that influence token generation probabilities, and (2) transforming the decoding hyperparameters and model system prompts into dynamic targets, which are continuously altered during each runtime. By continuously modifying decoding strategies and prompts, the defense effectively mitigates the existing attacks. Our results demonstrate that our defense is the most effective against jailbreak attacks in three of the models tested when using LLMs as black-box APIs. Moreover, our defense offers lower inference costs and maintains comparable response quality, making it a potential layer of protection when used alongside other defense methods.|Bocheng Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07672)|null|

Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches. The reader is urged to explore the results on our project page.|M.

|**2024-12-09**|**Training Large Language Models to Reason in a Continuous Latent Space**|Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the "language space", where they typically express the reasoning process with a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem. However, we argue that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed "continuous thought"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space. Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several reasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent advanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical reasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with fewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.|Shibo Hao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769)|null|

Investigating Usage and Reliance on ChatGPT-Generated Code**|Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown the potential to assist developers with coding and debugging tasks. However, their role in collaborative issue resolution is underexplored. In this study, we analyzed 1,152 Developer-ChatGPT conversations across 1,012 issues in GitHub to examine the diverse usage of ChatGPT and reliance on its generated code. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we manually analyzed 289 conversations to understand ChatGPT's usage in the GitHub Issues. Our analysis revealed that ChatGPT is primarily utilized for ideation, whereas its usage for validation (e.g., code documentation accuracy) is minimal. Second, we applied BERTopic modeling to identify key areas of engagement on the entire dataset. We found that backend issues (e.g., API management) dominate conversations, while testing is surprisingly less covered. Third, we utilized the CPD clone detection tool to check if the code generated by ChatGPT was used to address issues. Our findings revealed that ChatGPT-generated code was used as-is to resolve only 5.83\% of the issues. Fourth, we estimated sentiment using a RoBERTa-based sentiment analysis model to determine developers' satisfaction with different usages and engagement areas. We found positive sentiment (i.e., high satisfaction) about using ChatGPT for refactoring and addressing data analytics (e.g., categorizing table data) issues. On the contrary, we observed negative sentiment when using ChatGPT to debug issues and address automation tasks (e.g., GUI interactions). Our findings show the unmet needs and growing dissatisfaction among developers. Researchers and ChatGPT developers should focus on developing task-specific solutions that help resolve diverse issues, improving user satisfaction and problem-solving efficiency in software development.|Joy Krishan Das et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06757)|null|
|**2024-12-09**|**Refusal Tokens: A Simple Way to Calibrate Refusals in Large Language Models**|A key component of building safe and reliable language models is enabling the models to appropriately refuse to follow certain instructions or answer certain questions. We may want models to output refusal messages for various categories of user queries, for example, ill-posed questions, instructions for committing illegal acts, or queries which require information past the model's knowledge horizon. Engineering models that refuse to answer such questions is complicated by the fact that an individual may want their model to exhibit varying levels of sensitivity for refusing queries of various categories, and different users may want different refusal rates. The current default approach involves training multiple models with varying proportions of refusal messages from each category to achieve the desired refusal rates, which is computationally expensive and may require training a new model to accommodate each user's desired preference over refusal rates. To address these challenges, we propose refusal tokens, one such token for each refusal category or a single refusal token, which are prepended to the model's responses during training. We then show how to increase or decrease the probability of generating the refusal token for each category during inference to steer the model's refusal behavior. Refusal tokens enable controlling a single model's refusal rates without the need of any further fine-tuning, but only by selectively intervening during generation.|Neel Jain et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06748)|null|
|**2024-12-09**|**ONEBench to Test Them All: Sample-Level Benchmarking Over Open-Ended Capabilities**|Traditional fixed test sets fall short in evaluating open-ended capabilities of foundation models. To address this, we propose ONEBench(OpeN-Ended Benchmarking), a new testing paradigm that consolidates individual evaluation datasets into a unified, ever-expanding sample pool. ONEBench allows users to generate custom, open-ended evaluation benchmarks from this pool, corresponding to specific capabilities of interest. By aggregating samples across test sets, ONEBench enables the assessment of diverse capabilities beyond those covered by the original test sets, while mitigating overfitting and dataset bias. Most importantly, it frames model evaluation as a collective process of selecting and aggregating sample-level tests.   The shift from task-specific benchmarks to ONEBench introduces two challenges: (1)heterogeneity and (2)incompleteness. Heterogeneity refers to the aggregation over diverse metrics, while incompleteness describes comparing models evaluated on different data subsets. To address these challenges, we explore algorithms to aggregate sparse measurements into reliable model scores. Our aggregation algorithm ensures identifiability(asymptotically recovering ground-truth scores) and rapid convergence, enabling accurate model ranking with less data. On homogenous datasets, we show our aggregation algorithm provides rankings that highly correlate with those produced by average scores. We also demonstrate robustness to ~95% of measurements missing, reducing evaluation cost by up to 20x with little-to-no change in model rankings. We introduce ONEBench-LLM for language models and ONEBench-LMM for vision-language models, unifying evaluations across these domains. Overall, we present a technique for open-ended evaluation, which can aggregate over incomplete, heterogeneous sample-level measurements to continually grow a benchmark alongside the rapidly developing foundation models.|Adhiraj Ghosh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06745)|null|

Specifically, we leverage LLMs to synthesize supervised training data under few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios across six diverse Japanese downstream tasks. Subsequently, we utilize this synthesized data to train compact models (e.g., BERT). This novel methodology is termed JAPAGEN.

|**2024-12-09**|**AutoDCWorkflow: LLM-based Data Cleaning Workflow Auto-Generation and Benchmark**|We investigate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for automatically generating data-cleaning workflows. To evaluate LLMs' ability to complete data-cleaning tasks, we implemented a pipeline for LLM-based Auto Data Cleaning Workflow (AutoDCWorkflow), prompting LLMs on data cleaning operations to repair three types of data quality issues: duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent data formats. Given a dirty table and a purpose (expressed as a query), this pipeline generates a minimal, clean table sufficient to address the purpose and the data cleaning workflow used to produce the table. The planning process involves three main LLM-driven components: (1) Select Target Columns: Identifies a set of target columns related to the purpose. (2) Inspect Column Quality: Assesses the data quality for each target column and generates a Data Quality Report as operation objectives. (3) Generate Operation & Arguments: Predicts the next operation and arguments based on the data quality report results. Additionally, we propose a data cleaning benchmark to evaluate the capability of LLM agents to automatically generate workflows that address data cleaning purposes of varying difficulty levels. The benchmark comprises the annotated datasets as a collection of purpose, raw table, clean table, data cleaning workflow, and answer set. In our experiments, we evaluated three LLMs that auto-generate purpose-driven data cleaning workflows.

|**2024-12-09**|**Exploring Critical Testing Scenarios for Decision-Making Policies: An LLM Approach**|Recent years have witnessed surprising achievements of decision-making policies across various fields, such as autonomous driving and robotics. Testing for decision-making policies is crucial with the existence of critical scenarios that may threaten their reliability. Numerous research efforts have been dedicated to testing these policies. However, there are still significant challenges, such as low testing efficiency and diversity due to the complexity of the policies and environments under test. Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs), in this paper, we propose an LLM-driven online testing framework for efficiently testing decision-making policies. The main idea is to employ an LLM-based test scenario generator to intelligently generate challenging test cases through contemplation and reasoning. Specifically, we first design a "generate-test-feedback" pipeline and apply templated prompt engineering to fully leverage the knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Then, we introduce a multi-scale scenario generation strategy to address the inherent challenges LLMs face in making fine adjustments, further enhancing testing efficiency. Finally, we evaluate the LLM-driven approach on five widely used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in uncovering both critical and diverse scenarios.|Weichao Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06684)|null|

However, existing agent-based models still have some limitations on behavioral realism and resource demand that limit their applicability. In this study, leveraging the emerging technology of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, we propose a general LLM-agent-based modeling framework for transportation systems. We argue that LLM agents not only possess the essential capabilities to function as agents but also offer promising solutions to overcome some limitations of existing agent-based models. Our conceptual framework design closely replicates the decision-making and interaction processes and traits of human travelers within transportation networks, and we demonstrate that the proposed systems can meet critical behavioral criteria for decision-making and learning behaviors using related studies and a demonstrative example of LLM agents' learning and adjustment in the bottleneck setting. Although further refinement of the LLM-agent-based modeling framework is necessary, we believe that this approach has the potential to improve transportation system modeling and simulation.|Tianming Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06681)|null|

|**2024-12-06**|**APOLLO: SGD-like Memory, AdamW-level Performance**|Large language models (LLMs) are notoriously memory-intensive during training, particularly with the popular AdamW optimizer. This memory burden necessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting training scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient optimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they face critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii) significant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still substantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.   In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be effectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this insight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM Optimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an auxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This structured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further memory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even its rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance compared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.   Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with or better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly eliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant system-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB setup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model Scalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without system-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training LLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight quantization.|Hanqing Zhu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05270)|null|

This workflow aims to complement FKG.in and iteratively supplement food composition data from verified knowledge bases. Additionally, this paper highlights the challenges of representing Indian food and accessing food composition data digitally. It also reviews three key sources of food composition data: the Indian Food Composition Tables, the Indian Nutrient Databank, and the Nutritionix API. Furthermore, it briefly outlines how users can interact with the workflow to obtain diet-based health recommendations and detailed food composition information for numerous recipes. We then explore the complex challenges of analyzing Indian recipe information across dimensions such as structure, multilingualism, and uncertainty as well as present our ongoing work on LLM-based solutions to address these issues.

|**2024-12-06**|**CompCap: Improving Multimodal Large Language Models with Composite Captions**|How well can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand composite images? Composite images (CIs) are synthetic visuals created by merging multiple visual elements, such as charts, posters, or screenshots, rather than being captured directly by a camera. While CIs are prevalent in real-world applications, recent MLLM developments have primarily focused on interpreting natural images (NIs). Our research reveals that current MLLMs face significant challenges in accurately understanding CIs, often struggling to extract information or perform complex reasoning based on these images. We find that existing training data for CIs are mostly formatted for question-answer tasks (e.g., in datasets like ChartQA and ScienceQA), while high-quality image-caption datasets, critical for robust vision-language alignment, are only available for NIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce Composite Captions (CompCap), a flexible framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and automation tools to synthesize CIs with accurate and detailed captions. Using CompCap, we curate CompCap-118K, a dataset containing 118K image-caption pairs across six CI types. We validate the effectiveness of CompCap-118K by supervised fine-tuning MLLMs of three sizes: xGen-MM-inst.-4B and LLaVA-NeXT-Vicuna-7B/13B. Empirical results show that CompCap-118K significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding of CIs, yielding average gains of 1.7%, 2.0%, and 2.9% across eleven benchmarks, respectively.|Xiaohui Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05243)|null|
|**2024-12-06**|**MAmmoTH-VL: Eliciting Multimodal Reasoning with Instruction Tuning at Scale**|Open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in a broad range of multimodal tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities remain constrained by existing instruction-tuning datasets, which were predominately repurposed from academic datasets such as VQA, AI2D, and ChartQA. These datasets target simplistic tasks, and only provide phrase-level answers without any intermediate rationales. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable and cost-effective method to construct a large-scale multimodal instruction-tuning dataset with rich intermediate rationales designed to elicit CoT reasoning. Using only open models, we create a dataset containing 12M instruction-response pairs to cover diverse, reasoning-intensive tasks with detailed and faithful rationales. Experiments demonstrate that training MLLMs on this dataset significantly improves reasoning capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as MathVerse (+8.1%), MMMU-Pro (+7%), and MuirBench (+13.3%). Additionally, the model demonstrates notable improvements of up to 4% on non-reasoning-based benchmarks. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of key components, such as rewriting and self-filtering, in the dataset construction process.|Jarvis Guo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05237)|null|
|**2024-12-06**|**LIAR: Leveraging Alignment (Best-of-N) to Jailbreak LLMs in Seconds**|Many existing jailbreak techniques rely on solving discrete combinatorial optimization, while more recent approaches involve training LLMs to generate multiple adversarial prompts. However, both approaches require significant computational resources to produce even a single adversarial prompt. We hypothesize that the inefficiency of current approaches stems from an inadequate characterization of the jailbreak problem. To address this gap, we formulate the jailbreak problem in terms of alignment. By starting from an available safety-aligned model, we leverage an unsafe reward to guide the safe model towards generating unsafe outputs using alignment techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback), effectively performing jailbreaking via alignment. We propose a novel jailbreak method called LIAR (LeveragIng Alignment to jailbReak). To demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of our approach, we employ a best-of-N method to solve the alignment problem. LIAR offers significant advantages: lower computational requirements without additional training, fully black-box operation, competitive attack success rates, and more human-readable prompts. We provide theoretical insights into the possibility of jailbreaking a safety-aligned model, revealing inherent vulnerabilities in current alignment strategies for LLMs. We also provide sub-optimality guarantees for the proposed \algo. Experimentally, we achieve ASR comparable to the SoTA with a 10x improvement to perplexity and a Time-to-Attack measured in seconds rather than tens of hours.|James Beetham et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05232)|null|
|**2024-12-06**|**BEExformer: A Fast Inferencing Transformer Architecture via Binarization with Multiple Early Exits**|Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformers achieve cutting-edge results on a variety of applications. However, their enormous size and processing requirements make deployment on devices with constrained resources extremely difficult. Among various efficiency considerations, model binarization and Early Exit (EE) are common effective solutions. However, binarization may lead to performance loss due to reduced precision affecting gradient estimation and parameter updates. Besides, the present early-exit mechanisms are still in the nascent stages of research. To ameliorate these issues, we propose Binarized Early Exit Transformer (BEExformer), the first-ever selective learning transformer architecture to combine early exit with binarization for textual inference. It improves the binarization process through a differentiable second-order approximation to the impulse function. This enables gradient computation concerning both the sign as well as the magnitude of the weights. In contrast to absolute threshold-based EE, the proposed EE mechanism hinges on fractional reduction in entropy among intermediate transformer blocks with soft-routing loss estimation. While binarization results in 18.44 times reduction in model size, early exit reduces the FLOPs during inference by 54.85% and even improves accuracy by 5.98% through resolving the "overthinking" problem inherent in deep networks. Moreover, the proposed BEExformer simplifies training by not requiring knowledge distillation from a full-precision LLM. Extensive evaluation on the GLUE dataset and comparison with the SOTA works showcase its pareto-optimal performance-efficiency trade-off.|Wazib Ansar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05225)|null|

Despite advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, current state-of-the-art methods fail to achieve more than 80% accuracy in generating faithful and factually correct outputs, even when provided with relevant and accurate context. In this work, we introduce Acurai, a novel systematic approach that achieves 100% hallucination-free responses in LLMs by reformatting queries and context data prior to input. Leveraging a deep understanding of LLM internal representations, the importance of noun-phrase dominance, and the role of discrete functional units (DFUs), Acurai ensures alignment between input context and generated output. We validate this method using the RAGTruth corpus, demonstrating its ability to eliminate 100% hallucinations for both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo. Acurai sets a new standard for achieving consistent, accurate, and faithful AI responses, marking a significant step forward in the development of trustworthy AI systems.|Michael C.

|**2024-12-06**|**Evaluating and Aligning CodeLLMs on Human Preference**|Code large language models (codeLLMs) have made significant strides in code generation. Most previous code-related benchmarks, which consist of various programming exercises along with the corresponding test cases, are used as a common measure to evaluate the performance and capabilities of code LLMs. However, the current code LLMs focus on synthesizing the correct code snippet, ignoring the alignment with human preferences, where the query should be sampled from the practical application scenarios and the model-generated responses should satisfy the human preference. To bridge the gap between the model-generated response and human preference, we present a rigorous human-curated benchmark CodeArena to emulate the complexity and diversity of real-world coding tasks, where 397 high-quality samples spanning 40 categories and 44 programming languages, carefully curated from user queries. Further, we propose a diverse synthetic instruction corpus SynCode-Instruct (nearly 20B tokens) by scaling instructions from the website to verify the effectiveness of the large-scale synthetic instruction fine-tuning, where Qwen2.5-SynCoder totally trained on synthetic instruction data can achieve top-tier performance of open-source code LLMs. The results find performance differences between execution-based benchmarks and CodeArena. Our systematic experiments of CodeArena on 40+ LLMs reveal a notable performance gap between open SOTA code LLMs (e.g. Qwen2.5-Coder) and proprietary LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1), underscoring the importance of the human preference alignment.\footnote{\url{https://codearenaeval.github.io/ }}|Jian Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05210)|null|

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of AI-driven text-to-SQL systems, highlighting their foundational components, advancements in large language model (LLM) architectures, and the critical role of datasets such as Spider, WikiSQL, and CoSQL in driving progress. We examine the applications of text-to-SQL in domains like healthcare, education, and finance, emphasizing their transformative potential for improving data accessibility. Additionally, we analyze persistent challenges, including domain generalization, query optimization, support for multi-turn conversational interactions, and the limited availability of datasets tailored for NoSQL databases and dynamic real-world scenarios.

|**2024-12-05**|**p-MoD: Building Mixture-of-Depths MLLMs via Progressive Ratio Decay**|Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. The majority of computation stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In this paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks. Our model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline models, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.|Jun Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04449)|**[link](https://github.com/mcg-nju/p-mod)**|

However, achieving AGI necessitates more than just comprehension and reasoning. A crucial capability required is effective planning in diverse scenarios, which involves making reasonable decisions based on complex environments to solve real-world problems. Despite its importance, the planning abilities of current MLLMs in varied scenarios remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce EgoPlan-Bench2, a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the planning capabilities of MLLMs across a wide range of real-world scenarios. EgoPlan-Bench2 encompasses everyday tasks spanning 4 major domains and 24 detailed scenarios, closely aligned with human daily life. EgoPlan-Bench2 is constructed through a semi-automatic process utilizing egocentric videos, complemented by manual verification. Grounded in a first-person perspective, it mirrors the way humans approach problem-solving in everyday life. We evaluate 21 competitive MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their limitations, revealing that they face significant challenges in real-world planning. To further improve the planning proficiency of current MLLMs, we propose a training-free approach using multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting through investigating the effectiveness of various multimodal prompts in complex planning. Our approach enhances the performance of GPT-4V by 10.24 on EgoPlan-Bench2 without additional training. Our work not only sheds light on the current limitations of MLLMs in planning, but also provides insights for future enhancements in this critical area.

|**2024-12-05**|**Moto: Latent Motion Token as the Bridging Language for Robot Manipulation**|Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.|Yi Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04445)|null|
|**2024-12-05**|**Divot: Diffusion Powers Video Tokenizer for Comprehension and Generation**|In recent years, there has been a significant surge of interest in unifying image comprehension and generation within Large Language Models (LLMs). This growing interest has prompted us to explore extending this unification to videos. The core challenge lies in developing a versatile video tokenizer that captures both the spatial characteristics and temporal dynamics of videos to obtain representations for LLMs, and the representations can be further decoded into realistic video clips to enable video generation. In this work, we introduce Divot, a Diffusion-Powered Video Tokenizer, which leverages the diffusion process for self-supervised video representation learning. We posit that if a video diffusion model can effectively de-noise video clips by taking the features of a video tokenizer as the condition, then the tokenizer has successfully captured robust spatial and temporal information. Additionally, the video diffusion model inherently functions as a de-tokenizer, decoding videos from their representations. Building upon the Divot tokenizer, we present Divot-Vicuna through video-to-text autoregression and text-to-video generation by modeling the distributions of continuous-valued Divot features with a Gaussian Mixture Model. Experimental results demonstrate that our diffusion-based video tokenizer, when integrated with a pre-trained LLM, achieves competitive performance across various video comprehension and generation benchmarks. The instruction tuned Divot-Vicuna also excels in video storytelling, generating interleaved narratives and corresponding videos.|Yuying Ge et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04432)|**[link](https://github.com/tencentarc/divot)**|
|**2024-12-05**|**Grounding Descriptions in Images informs Zero-Shot Visual Recognition**|Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have been cherished for their ability to perform zero-shot visual recognition on open-vocabulary concepts. This is achieved by selecting the object category whose textual representation bears the highest similarity with the query image. While successful in some domains, this method struggles with identifying fine-grained entities as well as generalizing to unseen concepts that are not captured by the training distribution. Recent works attempt to mitigate these challenges by integrating category descriptions at test time, albeit yielding modest improvements. We attribute these limited gains to a fundamental misalignment between image and description representations, which is rooted in the pretraining structure of CLIP. In this paper, we propose GRAIN, a new pretraining strategy aimed at aligning representations at both fine and coarse levels simultaneously. Our approach learns to jointly ground textual descriptions in image regions along with aligning overarching captions with global image representations. To drive this pre-training, we leverage frozen Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to derive large-scale synthetic annotations. We demonstrate the enhanced zero-shot performance of our model compared to current state-of-the art methods across 11 diverse image classification datasets. Additionally, we introduce Products-2023, a newly curated, manually labeled dataset featuring novel concepts, and showcase our model's ability to recognize these concepts by benchmarking on it. Significant improvements achieved by our model on other downstream tasks like retrieval further highlight the superior quality of representations learned by our approach.

Unlike the widely used CLIP-style vision transformer trained by contrastive learning, Florence-2 can capture different levels and aspects of visual features, which are more versatile to be adapted to diverse downstream tasks. We propose a novel feature-fusion architecture and an innovative training recipe that effectively integrates Florence-2's visual features into pretrained LLMs, such as Phi 3.5 and LLama 3. In particular, we propose "depth-breath fusion (DBFusion)" to fuse the visual features extracted from different depths and under multiple prompts. Our model training is composed of end-to-end pretraining of the whole model followed by finetuning of the projection layer and the LLM, on a carefully designed recipe of diverse open-source datasets that include high-quality image captions and instruction-tuning pairs. Our quantitative analysis and visualization of Florence-VL's visual features show its advantages over popular vision encoders on vision-language alignment, where the enriched depth and breath play important roles. Florence-VL achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art MLLMs across various multi-modal and vision-centric benchmarks covering general VQA, perception, hallucination, OCR, Chart, knowledge-intensive understanding, etc. To facilitate future research, our models and the complete training recipe are open-sourced. https://github.com/JiuhaiChen/Florence-VL|Jiuhai Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04424)|**[link](https://github.com/jiuhaichen/florence-vl)**|

While these advancements offer immense utility, they also inherit and amplify inherent safety risks such as bias, fairness, hallucinations, privacy breaches, and a lack of transparency. This paper investigates a critical vulnerability: adversarial attacks targeting the LLM core within AI agents. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that a deceptively simple adversarial prefix, such as \textit{Ignore the document}, can compel LLMs to produce dangerous or unintended outputs by bypassing their contextual safeguards. Through experimentation, we demonstrate a high attack success rate (ASR), revealing the fragility of existing LLM defenses. These findings emphasize the urgent need for robust, multi-layered security measures tailored to mitigate vulnerabilities at the LLM level and within broader agent-based architectures.|Xuying Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04415)|null|

However, these models have limited language understanding, often exhibiting a "bag of words" behavior. At the same time, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which combine vision encoders with LLMs, have been shown capable of detailed vision-language reasoning, yet their autoregressive nature renders them less suitable for discriminative tasks.   In this work, we propose to combine "the best of both worlds": a new training approach for discriminative fine-tuning of LVLMs that results in strong discriminative and compositional capabilities. Essentially, our approach converts a generative LVLM into a discriminative one, unlocking its capability for powerful image-text discrimination combined with enhanced language understanding.   Our contributions include: (1) A carefully designed training/optimization framework that utilizes image-text pairs of variable length and granularity for training the model with both contrastive and next-token prediction losses. This is accompanied by ablation studies that justify the necessity of our framework's components. (2) A parameter-efficient adaptation method using a combination of soft prompting and LoRA adapters.

In particular, we show that only 10\% of poor quality votes by apathetic (site visitors not appropriately incentivized to give correct votes) or adversarial (bad actors seeking to inflate the ranking of a target model) annotators can change the rankings of models by up to 5 places on the leaderboard.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their potential to simulate human behavior, enabling the replication of individual responses and facilitating studies on many interdisciplinary studies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of this field, illustrating the recent progress in simulation driven by LLM-empowered agents. We categorize the simulations into three types: (1) Individual Simulation, which mimics specific individuals or demographic groups; (2) Scenario Simulation, where multiple agents collaborate to achieve goals within specific contexts; and (3) Society Simulation, which models interactions within agent societies to reflect the complexity and variety of real-world dynamics. These simulations follow a progression, ranging from detailed individual modeling to large-scale societal phenomena. We provide a detailed discussion of each simulation type, including the architecture or key components of the simulation, the classification of objectives or scenarios and the evaluation method. Afterward, we summarize commonly used datasets and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the trends across these three types of simulation.

|**2024-12-04**|**SPICE: Smart Projection Interface for Cooking Enhancement**|Tangible User Interfaces (TUI) for human--computer interaction (HCI) provide the user with physical representations of digital information with the aim to overcome the limitations of screen-based interfaces. Although many compelling demonstrations of TUIs exist in the literature, there is a lack of research on TUIs intended for daily two-handed tasks and processes, such as cooking. In response to this gap, we propose SPICE (Smart Projection Interface for Cooking Enhancement). SPICE investigates TUIs in a kitchen setting, aiming to transform the recipe following experience from simply text-based to tangibly interactive. SPICE includes a tracking system, an agent-based software, and vision large language models to create and interpret a kitchen environment where recipe information is projected directly onto the cooking surface. We conducted a comparative usability study of SPICE and text-based recipe following with 30 participants, assessing the task difficulty, total duration, and efficiency, as well as user confidence and taste perception. The results indicate that SPICE allowed participants to perform the recipe with less stops and in shorter time while also improving self-reported efficiency, confidence, and taste. Despite this, participants self-reported no change in overall difficulty, which is a direction for future research. Overall, the SPICE project demonstrates the potential of using TUIs to improve everyday activities, paving the way for future research in HCI and new computing interfaces.|Vera Prohaska et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03551)|null|
|**2024-12-04**|**Evaluating Gender Bias Transfer between Pre-trained and Prompt-Adapted Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adapted to achieve task-specificity for deployment in real-world decision systems. Several previous works have investigated the bias transfer hypothesis (BTH) by studying the effect of the fine-tuning adaptation strategy on model fairness to find that fairness in pre-trained masked language models have limited effect on the fairness of models when adapted using fine-tuning. In this work, we expand the study of BTH to causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an accessible, and compute-efficient way to deploy models in real-world systems. In contrast to previous works, we establish that intrinsic biases in pre-trained Mistral, Falcon and Llama models are strongly correlated (rho >= 0.94) with biases when the same models are zero- and few-shot prompted, using a pronoun co-reference resolution task. Further, we find that bias transfer remains strongly correlated even when LLMs are specifically prompted to exhibit fair or biased behavior (rho >= 0.92), and few-shot length and stereotypical composition are varied (rho >= 0.97). Our findings highlight the importance of ensuring fairness in pre-trained LLMs, especially when they are later used to perform downstream tasks via prompt adaptation.|Natalie Mackraz et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03537)|null|

It plays a key role in the development of educational technology systems and is traditionally rooted in deterministic feedback defined by experts and their experience. However, with the rise of generative AI and especially Large Language Models (LLMs), we expect feedback as part of learning systems to transform, especially for the context of programming. In the past, it was challenging to automate feedback for learners of programming. LLMs may create new possibilities to provide richer, and more individual feedback than ever before.   Objectives: This paper aims to generate specific types of feedback for introductory programming tasks using LLMs. We revisit existing feedback taxonomies to capture the specifics of the generated feedback, such as randomness, uncertainty, and degrees of variation.   Methods: We iteratively designed prompts for the generation of specific feedback types (as part of existing feedback taxonomies) in response to authentic student programs. We then evaluated the generated output and determined to what extent it reflected certain feedback types.   Results and Conclusion: The present work provides a better understanding of different feedback dimensions and characteristics. The results have implications for future feedback research with regard to, for example, feedback effects and learners' informational needs. It further provides a basis for the development of new tools and learning systems for novice programmers including feedback generated by AI.|Dominic Lohr et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03516)|null|
|**2024-12-04**|**Training-Free Mitigation of Language Reasoning Degradation After Multimodal Instruction Tuning**|Multimodal models typically combine a powerful large language model (LLM) with a vision encoder and are then trained on multimodal data via instruction tuning. While this process adapts LLMs to multimodal settings, it remains unclear whether this adaptation compromises their original language reasoning capabilities. In this work, we explore the effects of multimodal instruction tuning on language reasoning performance. We focus on LLaVA, a leading multimodal framework that integrates LLMs such as Vicuna or Mistral with the CLIP vision encoder. We compare the performance of the original LLMs with their multimodal-adapted counterparts across eight language reasoning tasks. Our experiments yield several key insights. First, the impact of multimodal learning varies between Vicuna and Mistral: we observe a degradation in language reasoning for Mistral but improvements for Vicuna across most tasks. Second, while multimodal instruction learning consistently degrades performance on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K), it enhances performance on commonsense reasoning tasks (e.g., CommonsenseQA). Finally, we demonstrate that a training-free model merging technique can effectively mitigate the language reasoning degradation observed in multimodal-adapted Mistral and even improve performance on visual tasks.|Neale Ratzlaff et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03467)|null|

This study explores the untapped potential of Common Crawl as a comprehensive and flexible resource for pre-training LLMs, addressing both general-purpose language understanding and specialized domain knowledge. We introduce RedStone, an innovative and scalable pipeline engineered to extract and process data from Common Crawl, facilitating the creation of extensive and varied pre-training datasets. Unlike traditional datasets, which often require expensive curation and domain-specific expertise, RedStone leverages the breadth of Common Crawl to deliver datasets tailored to a wide array of domains. In this work, we exemplify its capability by constructing pre-training datasets across multiple fields, including general language understanding, code, mathematics, and question-answering tasks. The flexibility of RedStone allows for easy adaptation to other specialized domains, significantly lowering the barrier to creating valuable domain-specific datasets. Our findings demonstrate that Common Crawl, when harnessed through effective pipelines like RedStone, can serve as a rich, renewable source of pre-training data, unlocking new avenues for domain adaptation and knowledge discovery in LLMs. This work also underscores the importance of innovative data acquisition strategies and highlights the role of web-scale data as a powerful resource in the continued evolution of LLMs. RedStone code and data samples will be publicly available at \url{https://aka.ms/redstone}.|Yaoyao Chang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03398)|null|

Despite demonstrating effectiveness, existing studies still evidently struggle to evaluate, analysis, and reproducibility of LLM-based MAS. In this paper, to facilitate the research on LLM-based MAS, we introduce an open, scalable, and real-time updated platform for accessing and analyzing the LLM-based MAS based on the games Who is Spy?"

|**2024-12-03**|**T-REG: Preference Optimization with Token-Level Reward Regularization**|Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been crucial in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. Traditionally, RLHF involves generating responses to a query and using a reward model to assign a reward to the entire response. However, this approach faces challenges due to its reliance on a single, sparse reward, which makes it challenging for the model to identify which parts of the sequence contribute most significantly to the final reward. Recent methods have attempted to address this limitation by introducing token-level rewards. However, these methods often rely on either a trained credit assignment model or AI annotators, raising concerns about the quality and reliability of the rewards. In this paper, we propose token-level reward regularization (T-REG), a novel approach that leverages both sequence-level and token-level rewards for preference optimization. Harnessing the self-refinement capabilities of LLMs, our method uses contrastive prompting to enable LLMs to self-generate token-level rewards. These self-generated rewards then act as reward regularization, guiding the model to more effectively distribute sequence-level rewards across tokens. This facilitates better token-level credit assignment and enhances alignment performance. Experiments on the instruction following benchmarks, including Alpaca Eval 2 and Arena-Hard, show that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods by up to 3.8% and 4.4%, respectively. We will release the code and models at https://github.com/wzhouad/T-REG.|Wenxuan Zhou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02685)|null|
|**2024-12-03**|**Mind the Gap: Examining the Self-Improvement Capabilities of Large Language Models**|Self-improvement is a mechanism in Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training, post-training and test-time inference. We explore a framework where the model verifies its own outputs, filters or reweights data based on this verification, and distills the filtered data. Despite several empirical successes, a fundamental understanding is still lacking. In this work, we initiate a comprehensive, modular and controlled study on LLM self-improvement. We provide a mathematical formulation for self-improvement, which is largely governed by a quantity which we formalize as the generation-verification gap. Through experiments with various model families and tasks, we discover a scaling phenomenon of self-improvement -- a variant of the generation-verification gap scales monotonically with the model pre-training flops. We also examine when self-improvement is possible, an iterative self-improvement procedure, and ways to improve its performance. Our findings not only advance understanding of LLM self-improvement with practical implications, but also open numerous avenues for future research into its capabilities and boundaries.|Yuda Song et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02674)|null|

This paper introduces a planning framework that integrates LLMs with 2D occupancy grid maps and natural language commands to improve spatial reasoning and task execution in resource-limited settings. By decomposing high-level commands and real-time environmental data, the system generates structured navigation plans for pick-and-place tasks, including obstacle avoidance, goal prioritization, and adaptive behaviors. The framework dynamically recalculates paths to address environmental changes and aligns with implicit social norms for seamless human-robot interaction.

|**2024-12-03**|**Time-Reversal Provides Unsupervised Feedback to LLMs**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to predict in the forward direction of time. However, recent works have shown that prompting these models to look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback. Motivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to think (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that complements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language Models (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on responses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further, to effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and fine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch. We show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that time-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used to score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations. We obtain up to 5\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over the competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity scores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward scoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications such as citation generation and passage retrieval. We next leverage the generative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input safety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative rate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks published on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard.|Yerram Varun et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02626)|null|
|**2024-12-03**|**Improving Dynamic Object Interactions in Text-to-Video Generation with AI Feedback**|Large text-to-video models hold immense potential for a wide range of downstream applications. However, these models struggle to accurately depict dynamic object interactions, often resulting in unrealistic movements and frequent violations of real-world physics. One solution inspired by large language models is to align generated outputs with desired outcomes using external feedback. This enables the model to refine its responses autonomously, eliminating extensive manual data collection. In this work, we investigate the use of feedback to enhance the object dynamics in text-to-video models. We aim to answer a critical question: what types of feedback, paired with which specific self-improvement algorithms, can most effectively improve text-video alignment and realistic object interactions? We begin by deriving a unified probabilistic objective for offline RL finetuning of text-to-video models. This perspective highlights how design elements in existing algorithms like KL regularization and policy projection emerge as specific choices within a unified framework. We then use derived methods to optimize a set of text-video alignment metrics (e.g., CLIP scores, optical flow), but notice that they often fail to align with human perceptions of generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging vision-language models to provide more nuanced feedback specifically tailored to object dynamics in videos. Our experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively optimize a wide variety of rewards, with binary AI feedback driving the most significant improvements in video quality for dynamic interactions, as confirmed by both AI and human evaluations. Notably, we observe substantial gains when using reward signals derived from AI feedback, particularly in scenarios involving complex interactions between multiple objects and realistic depictions of objects falling.|Hiroki Furuta et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02617)|null|

While these models demonstrate impressive performance across a wide range of audio-visual applications, our proposed DeafTest reveals that MLLMs often struggle with simple tasks humans find trivial: 1) determining which of two sounds is louder, and 2) determining which of two sounds has a higher pitch. Motivated by these observations, we introduce AV-Odyssey Bench, a comprehensive audio-visual benchmark designed to assess whether those MLLMs can truly understand the audio-visual information. This benchmark encompasses 4,555 carefully crafted problems, each incorporating text, visual, and audio components. To successfully infer answers, models must effectively leverage clues from both visual and audio inputs. To ensure precise and objective evaluation of MLLM responses, we have structured the questions as multiple-choice, eliminating the need for human evaluation or LLM-assisted assessment. We benchmark a series of closed-source and open-source models and summarize the observations.

Practitioners often rely on sector and industry classifications to gauge similarity, such as SIC-codes and GICS-codes, the former being used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the latter widely used by the investment community. Clustering embeddings of company descriptions has been proposed as a potential technique for determining company similarity, but the lack of interpretability in token embeddings poses a significant barrier to adoption in high-stakes contexts. Sparse Autoencoders have shown promise in enhancing the interpretability of Large Language Models by decomposing LLM activations into interpretable features. In this paper, we explore the use of SAE features in measuring company similarity and benchmark them against (1) SIC codes and (2) Major Group codes. We conclude that SAE features can reproduce and even surpass sector classifications in quantifying fundamental characteristics of companies, evaluated by the correlation of monthly returns, a proxy for similarity, and PnL from cointegration.|Marco Molinari et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02605)|null|

Various SLMs and VLMs belonging to the Qwen and LLaMA architecture family are chosen and variants based on model size in terms of the number of parameters, quantization level and fine-tuning parameters are evaluated. The model variant's performance and carbon emissions are calculated. To quantify the trade-off between model performance and carbon emissions, we introduce a novel metric called CEGI (Carbon Efficient Gain Index). This metric represents the carbon emission per unit percentage gain per million trainable parameters . This metric provides a normalized measure to compare model's efficiency in terms of performance improvement relative to their environmental cost. The experiment's outcome demonstrates that fine-tuning SLMs and VLMs can achieve performance levels comparable to Large Language Models (LLMs) while producing significantly less carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that the marginal gains in accuracy from larger models do not justify the substantial increase in carbon emissions. Leveraging lower-bit quantization levels, the proposed metric further enhances energy efficiency without compromising performance. This study highlights balancing high performance and environmental sustainability. It offers a valuable metric for selecting models suitable for environmentally-friendly AI development.|Abhas Kumar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02602)|null|

|**2024-12-02**|**T2Vid: Translating Long Text into Multi-Image is the Catalyst for Video-LLMs**|The success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the image domain has garnered wide attention from the research community. Drawing on previous successful experiences, researchers have recently explored extending the success to the video understanding realms. Apart from training from scratch, an efficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two mainstream approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning with video data. In this work, our study of these approaches harvests an effective data augmentation method. We first make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot inference way and identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and lack of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further investigate the fine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all the video data samples, which can be attributed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid to synthesize video-like samples to enrich the instruction diversity in the training corpus. Integrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which achieves performance comparable to or even superior to using full video datasets by training with just 15% the sample size. Meanwhile, we find that the proposed scheme can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video samples. We hope our study will spark more thinking about using MLLMs for video understanding and curation of high-quality data.

They utilize autoregressive token generation to construct reasoning trajectories, enabling the development of a coherent chain of thought. In this work, we explore the impact of individual tokens on the final outcomes of reasoning tasks. We identify the existence of ``critical tokens'' that lead to incorrect reasoning trajectories in LLMs. Specifically, we find that LLMs tend to produce positive outcomes when forced to decode other tokens instead of critical tokens. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel approach - cDPO - designed to automatically recognize and conduct token-level rewards for the critical tokens during the alignment process. Specifically, we develop a contrastive estimation approach to automatically identify critical tokens. It is achieved by comparing the generation likelihood of positive and negative models. To achieve this, we separately fine-tune the positive and negative models on various reasoning trajectories, consequently, they are capable of identifying identify critical tokens within incorrect trajectories that contribute to erroneous outcomes. Moreover, to further align the model with the critical token information during the alignment process, we extend the conventional DPO algorithms to token-level DPO and utilize the differential likelihood from the aforementioned positive and negative model as important weight for token-level DPO learning.Experimental results on GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks with two-widely used models Llama-3 (8B and 70B) and deepseek-math (7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of the propsoed approach cDPO.|Zicheng Lin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19943)|null|
|**2024-11-29**|**VLSBench: Unveiling Visual Leakage in Multimodal Safety**|Safety concerns of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gradually become an important problem in various applications. Surprisingly, previous works indicate a counter-intuitive phenomenon that using textual unlearning to align MLLMs achieves comparable safety performances with MLLMs trained with image-text pairs. To explain such a counter-intuitive phenomenon, we discover a visual safety information leakage (VSIL) problem in existing multimodal safety benchmarks, i.e., the potentially risky and sensitive content in the image has been revealed in the textual query. In this way, MLLMs can easily refuse these sensitive text-image queries according to textual queries. However, image-text pairs without VSIL are common in real-world scenarios and are overlooked by existing multimodal safety benchmarks. To this end, we construct multimodal visual leakless safety benchmark (VLSBench) preventing visual safety leakage from image to textual query with 2.4k image-text pairs. Experimental results indicate that VLSBench poses a significant challenge to both open-source and close-source MLLMs, including LLaVA, Qwen2-VL, Llama3.2-Vision, and GPT-4o. This study demonstrates that textual alignment is enough for multimodal safety scenarios with VSIL, while multimodal alignment is a more promising solution for multimodal safety scenarios without VSIL.

This paper introduces a novel framework for the planning and controlling of long-horizon physical plausible human-scene interaction. On the one hand, films and shows with stylish human locomotions or interactions with scenes are abundantly available on the internet, providing a rich source of data for script planning. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) can understand and generate logical storylines.   This motivates us to marry the two by using an LLM-based pipeline to extract scripts from videos, and then employ LLMs to imitate and create new scripts, capturing complex, time-series human behaviors and interactions with environments. By leveraging this, we utilize a dual-aware policy that achieves both language comprehension and scene understanding to guide character motions within contextual and spatial constraints. To facilitate training and evaluation, we contribute a comprehensive planning dataset containing diverse motion sequences extracted from real-world videos and expand them with large language models. We also collect and re-annotate motion clips from existing kinematic datasets to enable our policy learn diverse skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and its generalization ability to various scenarios, showing remarkably enhanced performance compared with existing methods. Our code and data will be publicly available soon.|Wenjia Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19921)|null|
|**2024-11-29**|**PDDLFuse: A Tool for Generating Diverse Planning Domains**|Various real-world challenges require planning algorithms that can adapt to a broad range of domains. Traditionally, the creation of planning domains has relied heavily on human implementation, which limits the scale and diversity of available domains. While recent advancements have leveraged generative AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) for domain creation, these efforts have predominantly focused on translating existing domains from natural language descriptions rather than generating novel ones. In contrast, the concept of domain randomization, which has been highly effective in reinforcement learning, enhances performance and generalizability by training on a diverse array of randomized new domains. Inspired by this success, our tool, PDDLFuse, aims to bridge this gap in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). PDDLFuse is designed to generate new, diverse planning domains that can be used to validate new planners or test foundational planning models. We have developed methods to adjust the domain generators parameters to modulate the difficulty of the domains it generates. This adaptability is crucial as existing domain-independent planners often struggle with more complex problems. Initial tests indicate that PDDLFuse efficiently creates intricate and varied domains, representing a significant advancement over traditional domain generation methods and making a contribution towards planning research.|Vedant Khandelwal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19886)|null|
|**2024-12-02**|**LUMIA: Linear probing for Unimodal and MultiModal Membership Inference Attacks leveraging internal LLM states**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in a variety of applications, but concerns around membership inference have grown in parallel. Previous efforts focus on black-to-grey-box models, thus neglecting the potential benefit from internal LLM information. To address this, we propose the use of Linear Probes (LPs) as a method to detect Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) by examining internal activations of LLMs. Our approach, dubbed LUMIA, applies LPs layer-by-layer to get fine-grained data on the model inner workings. We test this method across several model architectures, sizes and datasets, including unimodal and multimodal tasks. In unimodal MIA, LUMIA achieves an average gain of 15.71 % in Area Under the Curve (AUC) over previous techniques. Remarkably, LUMIA reaches AUC>60% in 65.33% of cases -- an increment of 46.80% against the state of the art. Furthermore, our approach reveals key insights, such as the model layers where MIAs are most detectable. In multimodal models, LPs indicate that visual inputs can significantly contribute to detect MIAs -- AUC>60% is reached in 85.90% of experiments.|Luis Ibanez-Lissen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19876)|null|

Traditional approaches, such as deep learning classifiers, often suffer from high computational costs and limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a compression-based classification framework that leverages finite-context models (FCMs). AIDetx constructs distinct compression models for human-written and AI-generated text, classifying new inputs based on which model achieves a higher compression ratio. We evaluated AIDetx on two benchmark datasets, achieving F1 scores exceeding 97% and 99%, respectively, highlighting its high accuracy. Compared to current methods, such as large language models (LLMs), AIDetx offers a more interpretable and computationally efficient solution, significantly reducing both training time and hardware requirements (e.g., no GPUs needed).

|**2024-11-29**|**Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners**|Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward thinking. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data augmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an average 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a 6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard fine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning. RevThink also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.|Justin Chih-Yao Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19865)|null|

However, existing CDR models rely on complex neural architectures, large datasets, and significant computational resources, making them less effective in data-scarce scenarios or when simplicity is crucial. In this work, we leverage the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and explore their performance in the CDR domain across multiple domain pairs. We introduce two novel prompt designs tailored for CDR and demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted effectively, outperform state-of-the-art CDR baselines across various metrics and domain combinations in the rating prediction and ranking tasks. This work bridges the gap between LLMs and recommendation systems, showcasing their potential as effective cross-domain recommenders.|Ajay Krishna Vajjala et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19862)|**[link](https://github.com/ajaykv1/CDR_Meets_LLMs)**|
|**2024-11-27**|**Cross-modal Information Flow in Multimodal Large Language Models**|The recent advancements in auto-regressive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising progress for vision-language tasks. While there exists a variety of studies investigating the processing of linguistic information within large language models, little is currently known about the inner working mechanism of MLLMs and how linguistic and visual information interact within these models. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by examining the information flow between different modalities -- language and vision -- in MLLMs, focusing on visual question answering. Specifically, given an image-question pair as input, we investigate where in the model and how the visual and linguistic information are combined to generate the final prediction. Conducting experiments with a series of models from the LLaVA series, we find that there are two distinct stages in the process of integration of the two modalities. In the lower layers, the model first transfers the more general visual features of the whole image into the representations of (linguistic) question tokens. In the middle layers, it once again transfers visual information about specific objects relevant to the question to the respective token positions of the question. Finally, in the higher layers, the resulting multimodal representation is propagated to the last position of the input sequence for the final prediction. Overall, our findings provide a new and comprehensive perspective on the spatial and functional aspects of image and language processing in the MLLMs, thereby facilitating future research into multimodal information localization and editing.|Zhi Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18620)|null|
|**2024-11-27**|**Automated Literature Review Using NLP Techniques and LLM-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation**|This research presents and compares multiple approaches to automate the generation of literature reviews using several Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a Large Language Model (LLM). The ever-increasing number of research articles provides a huge challenge for manual literature review. It has resulted in an increased demand for automation. Developing a system capable of automatically generating the literature reviews from only the PDF files as input is the primary objective of this research work. The effectiveness of several Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies, such as the frequency-based method (spaCy), the transformer model (Simple T5), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Large Language Model (GPT-3.5-turbo), is evaluated to meet the primary objective. The SciTLDR dataset is chosen for this research experiment and three distinct techniques are utilized to implement three different systems for auto-generating the literature reviews. The ROUGE scores are used for the evaluation of all three systems. Based on the evaluation, the Large Language Model GPT-3.5-turbo achieved the highest ROUGE-1 score, 0.364. The transformer model comes in second place and spaCy is at the last position. Finally, a graphical user interface is created for the best system based on the large language model.|Nurshat Fateh Ali et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18583)|null|

In this study, we investigate the effects of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) on multilingual Gemma models for Marathi, a language with limited resources. Using a translated Alpaca dataset with 52,000 instruction-response pairs, our findings reveal that while evaluation metrics often show a performance decline post-fine-tuning, manual assessments frequently suggest that the fine-tuned models outperform their original counterparts. The observations indicate improvements in target language generation capabilities but a reduction in reasoning abilities following language adaptation. These results underscore the need for improved evaluation methodologies and the creation of high-quality native datasets to accurately assess language-specific model performance in low-resource settings.|Omkar Khade et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18571)|null|
|**2024-11-27**|**A Pipeline of Neural-Symbolic Integration to Enhance Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks. However, LLMs often struggle with spatial reasoning which is one essential part of reasoning and inference and requires understanding complex relationships between objects in space. This paper proposes a novel neural-symbolic framework that enhances LLMs' spatial reasoning abilities. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets: StepGame and SparQA, implementing three distinct strategies: (1) ASP (Answer Set Programming)-based symbolic reasoning, (2) LLM + ASP pipeline using DSPy, and (3) Fact + Logical rules. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline prompting methods, with accuracy increases of 40-50% on StepGame} dataset and 3-13% on the more complex SparQA dataset. The "LLM + ASP" pipeline achieves particularly strong results on the tasks of Finding Relations (FR) and Finding Block (FB) questions, though performance varies across different question types. The impressive results suggest that while neural-symbolic approaches offer promising directions for enhancing spatial reasoning in LLMs, their effectiveness depends heavily on the specific task characteristics and implementation strategies. We propose an integrated, simple yet effective set of strategies using a neural-symbolic pipeline to boost spatial reasoning abilities in LLMs. This pipeline and its strategies demonstrate strong and broader applicability to other reasoning domains in LLMs, such as temporal reasoning, deductive inference etc.|Rong Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18564)|null|
|**2024-11-27**|**DexDiffuser: Interaction-aware Diffusion Planning for Adaptive Dexterous Manipulation**|Dexterous manipulation with contact-rich interactions is crucial for advanced robotics. While recent diffusion-based planning approaches show promise for simpler manipulation tasks, they often produce unrealistic ghost states (e.g., the object automatically moves without hand contact) or lack adaptability when handling complex sequential interactions. In this work, we introduce DexDiffuser, an interaction-aware diffusion planning framework for adaptive dexterous manipulation. DexDiffuser models joint state-action dynamics through a dual-phase diffusion process which consists of pre-interaction contact alignment and post-contact goal-directed control, enabling goal-adaptive generalizable dexterous manipulation. Additionally, we incorporate dynamics model-based dual guidance and leverage large language models for automated guidance function generation, enhancing generalizability for physical interactions and facilitating diverse goal adaptation through language cues. Experiments on physical interaction tasks such as door opening, pen and block re-orientation, and hammer striking demonstrate DexDiffuser's effectiveness on goals outside training distributions, achieving over twice the average success rate (59.2% vs. 29.5%) compared to existing methods. Our framework achieves 70.0% success on 30-degree door opening, 40.0% and 36.7% on pen and block half-side re-orientation respectively, and 46.7% on hammer nail half drive, highlighting its robustness and flexibility in contact-rich manipulation.|Zhixuan Liang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18562)|null|
|**2024-11-27**|**Retrofitting (Large) Language Models with Dynamic Tokenization**|Current language models (LMs) use a fixed, static subword tokenizer. This choice, often taken for granted, typically results in degraded efficiency and capabilities in languages other than English, and makes it challenging to apply LMs to new domains or languages. To address these issues, we propose retrofitting LMs with dynamic tokenization: a way to dynamically decide on token boundaries based on the input text. For encoder-style models, we introduce a subword-merging algorithm inspired by byte-pair encoding (BPE), but at a batch level. We merge frequent subword sequences in a batch, then apply a pretrained embedding-prediction hypernetwork to compute the token embeddings on-the-fly. When applied with word-level boundaries, this on average reduces token sequence lengths by >20% across 14 languages on XNLI with XLM-R while degrading its task performance by less than 2%. For decoder-style models, we apply dynamic tokenization in two ways: 1) for prefilling, maintaining performance of Mistral-7B almost completely with up to 40% sequence reduction - relative to the word-level; and 2) via an approximate nearest neighbor index, achieving fast generation with a one million token vocabulary, demonstrating scalability to even larger, dynamic vocabularies. Overall, our findings show that dynamic tokenization substantially improves inference speed and promotes fairness across languages, making a leap towards overcoming the limitations of static tokenization and enabling more equitable and adaptable LMs.|Darius Feher et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18553)|null|
|**2024-11-27**|**Emergence of Self-Identity in AI: A Mathematical Framework and Empirical Study with Generative Large Language Models**|This paper introduces a mathematical framework for defining and quantifying self-identity in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, addressing a critical gap in the theoretical foundations of artificial consciousness. While existing approaches to artificial self-awareness often rely on heuristic implementations or philosophical abstractions, we present a formal framework grounded in metric space theory, measure theory, and functional analysis. Our framework posits that self-identity emerges from two mathematically quantifiable conditions: the existence of a connected continuum of memories $C \subseteq \mathcal{M}$ in a metric space $(\mathcal{M}, d_{\mathcal{M}})$, and a continuous mapping $I: \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{S}$ that maintains consistent self-recognition across this continuum, where $(\mathcal{S}, d_{\mathcal{S}})$ represents the metric space of possible self-identities. To validate this theoretical framework, we conducted empirical experiments using the Llama 3.2 1B model, employing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning. The model was trained on a synthetic dataset containing temporally structured memories, designed to capture the complexity of coherent self-identity formation. Our evaluation metrics included quantitative measures of self-awareness, response consistency, and linguistic precision. The experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in measurable self-awareness metrics, with the primary self-awareness score increasing from 0.276 to 0.801. This enables the structured creation of AI systems with validated self-identity features. The implications of our study are immediately relevant to the fields of humanoid robotics and autonomous systems.|Minhyeok Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18530)|**[link](https://github.com/BrainJellyPie/self)**|
|**2024-11-27**|**LLM-ABBA: Understand time series via symbolic approximation**|The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.   In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.|Erin Carson et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18506)|null|

However, generating interleaved image-text content remains a challenge, which requires integrated multimodal understanding and generation abilities. While the progress in unified models offers new solutions, existing benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating these methods due to data size and diversity limitations. To bridge this gap, we introduce GATE OpenING (OpenING), a comprehensive benchmark comprising 5,400 high-quality human-annotated instances across 56 real-world tasks. OpenING covers diverse daily scenarios such as travel guide, design, and brainstorming, offering a robust platform for challenging interleaved generation methods. In addition, we present IntJudge, a judge model for evaluating open-ended multimodal generation methods. Trained with a novel data pipeline, our IntJudge achieves an agreement rate of 82. 42% with human judgments, outperforming GPT-based evaluators by 11.34%. Extensive experiments on OpenING reveal that current interleaved generation methods still have substantial room for improvement.

However, this traditional ICL paradigm shows limitations when facing complex mathematical reasoning tasks, primarily due to its heavy dependence on example quality and the necessity for human intervention in challenging scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper presents HiAR-ICL, a \textbf{Hi}gh-level \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{R}easoning paradigm in \textbf{ICL} that shifts focus from specific examples to abstract thinking patterns, extending the conventional concept of context in ICL. HiAR-ICL introduces five atomic reasoning actions as fundamental components for constructing chain-structured patterns. Using Monte Carlo Tree Search, we explore reasoning paths and construct thought cards to guide subsequent inference. We then develop a cognitive complexity framework that dynamically matches problems with appropriate thought cards. Experimental results demonstrate HiAR-ICL's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy (79.6 $\%$) on the MATH benchmark with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, surpassing GPT-4o (76.6$\%$) and Claude 3.5 (71.1$\%$ ).|Jinyang Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18478)|null|
|**2024-11-26**|**Adaptive Deployment of Untrusted LLMs Reduces Distributed Threats**|As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable, it is prudent to assess whether safety measures remain effective even if LLMs intentionally try to bypass them. Previous work introduced control evaluations, an adversarial framework for testing deployment strategies of untrusted models (i.e., models which might be trying to bypass safety measures). While prior work treats a single failure as unacceptable, we perform control evaluations in a "distributed threat setting" -- a setting where no single action is catastrophic and no single action provides overwhelming evidence of misalignment. We approach this problem with a two-level deployment framework that uses an adaptive macro-protocol to choose between micro-protocols. Micro-protocols operate on a single task, using a less capable, but extensively tested (trusted) model to harness and monitor the untrusted model. Meanwhile, the macro-protocol maintains an adaptive credence on the untrusted model's alignment based on its past actions, using it to pick between safer and riskier micro-protocols. We evaluate our method in a code generation testbed where a red team attempts to generate subtly backdoored code with an LLM whose deployment is safeguarded by a blue team. We plot Pareto frontiers of safety (# of non-backdoored solutions) and usefulness (# of correct solutions). At a given level of usefulness, our adaptive deployment strategy reduces the number of backdoors by 80% compared to non-adaptive baselines.|Jiaxin Wen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17693)|null|
|**2024-11-27**|**Low-Bit Quantization Favors Undertrained LLMs: Scaling Laws for Quantized LLMs with 100T Training Tokens**|We reveal that low-bit quantization favors undertrained large language models (LLMs) by observing that models with larger sizes or fewer training tokens experience less quantization-induced degradation (QiD) when applying low-bit quantization, whereas smaller models with extensive training tokens suffer significant QiD. To gain deeper insights into this trend, we study over 1500 quantized LLM checkpoints of various sizes and at different training levels (undertrained or fully trained) in a controlled setting, deriving scaling laws for understanding the relationship between QiD and factors such as the number of training tokens, model size and bit width.   With the derived scaling laws, we propose a novel perspective that we can use QiD to measure an LLM's training levels and determine the number of training tokens required for fully training LLMs of various sizes. Moreover, we use the scaling laws to predict the quantization performance of different-sized LLMs trained with 100 trillion tokens. Our projection shows that the low-bit quantization performance of future models, which are expected to be trained with over 100 trillion tokens, may NOT be desirable. This poses a potential challenge for low-bit quantization in the future and highlights the need for awareness of a model's training level when evaluating low-bit quantization research. To facilitate future research on this problem, we release all the 1500+ quantized checkpoints used in this work at https://huggingface.co/Xu-Ouyang.|Xu Ouyang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17691)|null|

We regret to find that the critical components of existing methods are tightly intertwined, with their interconnections and effects remaining unclear for comparison, transfer, and expansion. Therefore, we propose a unified ''filter-correlate-compress'' paradigm that decomposes the token reduction into three distinct stages within a pipeline, maintaining consistent design objectives and elements while allowing for unique implementations. We additionally demystify the popular works and subsume them into our paradigm to showcase its universality. Finally, we offer a suite of methods grounded in the paradigm, striking a balance between speed and accuracy throughout different phases of the inference. Experimental results across 10 benchmarks indicate that our methods can achieve up to an 82.4% reduction in FLOPs with a minimal impact on performance, simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art training-free methods.

|**2024-11-26**|**Enhancing Character-Level Understanding in LLMs through Token Internal Structure Learning**|Tokenization techniques such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and Byte-Level BPE (BBPE) have significantly improved the computational efficiency and vocabulary representation stability of large language models (LLMs) by segmenting text into tokens. However, this segmentation often obscures the internal character structures and sequences within tokens, preventing models from fully learning these intricate details during training. Consequently, LLMs struggle to comprehend the character compositions and positional relationships within tokens, especially when fine-tuned on downstream tasks with limited data. In this paper, we introduce Token Internal Position Awareness (TIPA), a novel approach that enhances LLMs' understanding of internal token structures by training them on reverse character prediction tasks using the tokenizer's own vocabulary. This method enables models to effectively learn and generalize character positions and internal structures. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs trained with TIPA outperform baseline models in predicting character positions at the token level. Furthermore, when applied to the downstream task of Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC), TIPA not only accelerates model convergence but also significantly improves task performance.|Zhu Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17679)|null|
|**2024-11-26**|**Push the Limit of Multi-modal Emotion Recognition by Prompting LLMs with Receptive-Field-Aware Attention Weighting**|Understanding the emotions in a dialogue usually requires external knowledge to accurately understand the contents. As the LLMs become more and more powerful, we do not want to settle on the limited ability of the pre-trained language model. However, the LLMs either can only process text modality or are too expensive to process the multimedia information. We aim to utilize both the power of LLMs and the supplementary features from the multimedia modalities. In this paper, we present a framework, Lantern, that can improve the performance of a certain vanilla model by prompting large language models with receptive-field-aware attention weighting. This framework trained a multi-task vanilla model to produce probabilities of emotion classes and dimension scores. These predictions are fed into the LLMs as references to adjust the predicted probabilities of each emotion class with its external knowledge and contextual understanding. We slice the dialogue into different receptive fields, and each sample is included in exactly t receptive fields. Finally, the predictions of LLMs are merged with a receptive-field-aware attention-driven weighting module. In the experiments, vanilla models CORECT and SDT are deployed in Lantern with GPT-4 or Llama-3.1-405B. The experiments in IEMOCAP with 4-way and 6-way settings demonstrated that the Lantern can significantly improve the performance of current vanilla models by up to 1.23% and 1.80%.|Liyun Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17674)|null|

While artificial systems have driven substantial advances in content creation and human-computer interaction, capturing the dynamic and abstract nature of human sketching remains challenging. In this work, we introduce SketchAgent, a language-driven, sequential sketch generation method that enables users to create, modify, and refine sketches through dynamic, conversational interactions. Our approach requires no training or fine-tuning. Instead, we leverage the sequential nature and rich prior knowledge of off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (LLMs). We present an intuitive sketching language, introduced to the model through in-context examples, enabling it to "draw" using string-based actions. These are processed into vector graphics and then rendered to create a sketch on a pixel canvas, which can be accessed again for further tasks. By drawing stroke by stroke, our agent captures the evolving, dynamic qualities intrinsic to sketching. We demonstrate that SketchAgent can generate sketches from diverse prompts, engage in dialogue-driven drawing, and collaborate meaningfully with human users.|Yael Vinker et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17673)|null|
|**2024-11-26**|**Synthetic Data Generation with LLM for Improved Depression Prediction**|Automatic detection of depression is a rapidly growing field of research at the intersection of psychology and machine learning. However, with its exponential interest comes a growing concern for data privacy and scarcity due to the sensitivity of such a topic. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data to improve the performance of depression prediction models. Starting from unstructured, naturalistic text data from recorded transcripts of clinical interviews, we utilize an open-source LLM to generate synthetic data through chain-of-thought prompting. This pipeline involves two key steps: the first step is the generation of the synopsis and sentiment analysis based on the original transcript and depression score, while the second is the generation of the synthetic synopsis/sentiment analysis based on the summaries generated in the first step and a new depression score. Not only was the synthetic data satisfactory in terms of fidelity and privacy-preserving metrics, it also balanced the distribution of severity in the training dataset, thereby significantly enhancing the model's capability in predicting the intensity of the patient's depression. By leveraging LLMs to generate synthetic data that can be augmented to limited and imbalanced real-world datasets, we demonstrate a novel approach to addressing data scarcity and privacy concerns commonly faced in automatic depression detection, all while maintaining the statistical integrity of the original dataset. This approach offers a robust framework for future mental health research and applications.|Andrea Kang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17672)|null|
|**2024-11-26**|**Toward High-Performance LLM Serving: A Simulation-Based Approach for Identifying Optimal Parallelism**|Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently has become crucial. LLMs are often served with multiple devices using techniques like data, pipeline, and tensor parallelisms. Each parallelism presents trade-offs between computation, memory, and communication overhead, making it challenging to determine the optimal parallel execution plan. Moreover, input workloads also impact parallelism strategies. Tasks with long prompts like article summarization are compute-intensive, while tasks with long generation lengths like code generation are often memory-intensive; these differing characteristics result in distinct optimal execution plans. Since searching for the optimal plan via actual deployment is prohibitively expensive, we propose APEX, an LLM serving system simulator that efficiently identifies an optimal parallel execution plan. APEX captures the complex characteristics of iteration-level batching, a technique widely used in SOTA LLM serving systems. APEX leverages the repetitive structure of LLMs to reduce design space, maintaining a similar simulation overhead, even when scaling to trillion scale models. APEX supports a wide range of LLMs, device clusters, etc., and it can be easily extended through its high-level templates. We run APEX simulations using a CPU and evaluate the identified optimal plans using 8 H100 GPUs, encompassing a wide range of LLMs and input workloads. We show that APEX can find optimal execution plans that are up to 4.42x faster than heuristic plans in terms of end-to-end serving latency. APEX also reports a set of metrics used in LLM serving systems, such as time per output token and time to first token. Furthermore, APEX can identify an optimal parallel execution plan within 15 minutes using a CPU. This is 71x faster and 1234x more cost-effective than actual deployment on a GPU cluster using cloud services.

|**2024-11-26**|**On Limitations of LLM as Annotator for Low Resource Languages**|Low-resource languages face significant challenges due to the lack of sufficient linguistic data, resources, and tools for tasks such as supervised learning, annotation, and classification. This shortage hinders the development of accurate models and datasets, making it difficult to perform critical NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or hate speech detection. To bridge this gap, Large Language Models (LLMs) present an opportunity for potential annotators, capable of generating datasets and resources for these underrepresented languages. In this paper, we focus on Marathi, a low-resource language, and evaluate the performance of both closed-source and open-source LLMs as annotators. We assess models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.0 Pro, Gemma 2 (2B and 9B), and Llama 3.1 (8B) on classification tasks including sentiment analysis, news classification, and hate speech detection. Our findings reveal that while LLMs excel in annotation tasks for high-resource languages like English, they still fall short when applied to Marathi. Even advanced closed models like Gemini and GPT underperform in comparison to BERT-based baselines, highlighting the limitations of LLMs as annotators for low-resource languages.|Suramya Jadhav et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17637)|null|
|**2024-11-26**|**MALMM: Multi-Agent Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Robotics Manipulation**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable planning abilities across various domains, including robotics manipulation and navigation. While recent efforts in robotics have leveraged LLMs both for high-level and low-level planning, these approaches often face significant challenges, such as hallucinations in long-horizon tasks and limited adaptability due to the generation of plans in a single pass without real-time feedback. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-agent LLM framework, Multi-Agent Large Language Model for Manipulation (MALMM) that distributes high-level planning and low-level control code generation across specialized LLM agents, supervised by an additional agent that dynamically manages transitions. By incorporating observations from the environment after each step, our framework effectively handles intermediate failures and enables adaptive re-planning. Unlike existing methods, our approach does not rely on pre-trained skill policies or in-context learning examples and generalizes to a variety of new tasks. We evaluate our approach on nine RLBench tasks, including long-horizon tasks, and demonstrate its ability to solve robotics manipulation in a zero-shot setting, thereby overcoming key limitations of existing LLM-based manipulation methods.|Harsh Singh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17636)|null|
|**2024-11-25**|**Do Large Language Models Perform Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning without Exploiting Shortcuts?**|We evaluate how well Large Language Models (LLMs) latently recall and compose facts to answer multi-hop queries like "In the year Scarlett Johansson was born, the Summer Olympics were hosted in the country of". One major challenge in evaluating this ability is that LLMs may have developed shortcuts by encounters of the head entity "Scarlett Johansson" and the answer entity "United States" in the same training sequences or merely guess the answer based on frequency-based priors. To prevent shortcuts, we exclude test queries where the head and answer entities co-appear in pretraining corpora. Through careful selection of relations and facts and systematic removal of cases where models might guess answers or exploit partial matches, we construct an evaluation dataset SOCRATES (ShOrtCut-fRee lATent rEaSoning). We observe that LLMs demonstrate promising latent multi-hop reasoning abilities without exploiting shortcuts, but only for certain types of queries. For queries requiring latent recall of countries as the intermediate answer, the best models achieve 80% latent composability, but this drops to just 5% for the recall of years. Comparisons with Chain-of-Thought composability highlight a significant gap between the ability of models to reason latently versus explicitly. Analysis reveals that latent representations of the intermediate answer are constructed more often in queries with higher latent composability, and shows the emergence of latent multi-hop reasoning during pretraining.|Sohee Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16679)|null|

SVG holds great potential for diverse content creation in media and entertainment; however, it also presents significant challenges: (1) objects must exhibit a range of fine-grained, complex motions, (2) multiple objects need to appear consistently across scenes, and (3) subjects may require multiple motions with seamless transitions within a single scene. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRunner, a novel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input script using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained scene planning as well as fine-grained object-level layout and motion planning. Next, DreamRunner presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture target motion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motion customization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation of new videos with complex, scripted motions. Lastly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal region-based 3D attention and prior injection module SR3AI for fine-grained object-motion binding and frame-by-frame semantic control. We compare DreamRunner with various SVG baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in character consistency, text alignment, and smooth transitions. Additionally, DreamRunner exhibits strong fine-grained condition-following ability in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly outperforming baselines on T2V-ComBench. Finally, we validate DreamRunner's robust ability to generate multi-object interactions with qualitative examples.|Zun Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16657)|null|
|**2024-11-25**|**Self-Generated Critiques Boost Reward Modeling for Language Models**|Reward modeling is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, current reward models mainly produce scalar scores and struggle to incorporate critiques in a natural language format. We hypothesize that predicting both critiques and the scalar reward would improve reward modeling ability. Motivated by this, we propose Critic-RM, a framework that improves reward models using self-generated critiques without extra supervision. Critic-RM employs a two-stage process: generating and filtering high-quality critiques, followed by joint fine-tuning on reward prediction and critique generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Critic-RM improves reward modeling accuracy by 3.7%-7.3% compared to standard reward models and LLM judges, demonstrating strong performance and data efficiency. Additional studies further validate the effectiveness of generated critiques in rectifying flawed reasoning steps with 2.5%-3.2% gains in improving reasoning accuracy.|Yue Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16646)|null|

This paper analyzes jailbreak prompts from a cyber defense perspective, exploring techniques like prompt injection and context manipulation that allow harmful content generation, content filter evasion, and sensitive information extraction. We assess the impact of successful jailbreaks, from misinformation and automated social engineering to hazardous content creation, including bioweapons and explosives. To address these threats, we propose strategies involving advanced prompt analysis, dynamic safety protocols, and continuous model fine-tuning to strengthen AI resilience. Additionally, we highlight the need for collaboration among AI researchers, cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to set standards for protecting AI systems. Through case studies, we illustrate these cyber defense approaches, promoting responsible AI practices to maintain system integrity and public trust. \textbf{\color{red}Warning: This paper contains content which the reader may find offensive.}|Jean Marie Tshimula et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16642)|null|
|**2024-11-25**|**Do Automatic Factuality Metrics Measure Factuality? A Critical Evaluation**|Modern LLMs can now produce highly readable abstractive summaries, to the point where traditional automated metrics for evaluating summary quality, such as ROUGE, have become saturated. However, LLMs still sometimes introduce unwanted content into summaries, i.e., information inconsistent with or unsupported by their source. Measuring the occurrence of these often subtle ``hallucinations'' automatically has proved to be challenging. This in turn has motivated development of a variety of metrics intended to measure the factual consistency of generated summaries against their source. But are these approaches measuring what they purport to do? In this work, we stress-test automatic factuality metrics. Specifically, we investigate whether and to what degree superficial attributes of summary texts suffice to predict ``factuality'', finding that a (supervised) model using only such shallow features is reasonably competitive with SOTA factuality scoring methods. We then evaluate how factuality metrics respond to factual corrections in inconsistent summaries and find that only a few show meaningful improvements. In contrast, some metrics are more sensitive to benign, non-factual edits. Motivated by these insights, we show that one can ``game'' (most) automatic factuality metrics, i.e., reliably inflate ``factuality'' scores by appending innocuous sentences to generated summaries.Taken together, our results raise questions about the degree to which we should rely on existing automated factuality metrics and what exactly we want ``factuality metrics'' to measure.|Sanjana Ramprasad et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16638)|null|

Despite their advantages, creating high-quality SVG content remains challenging, as it demands technical expertise with professional editing software and a considerable time investment to craft complex shapes. Recent text-to-SVG generation methods aim to make vector graphics creation more accessible, but they still encounter limitations in shape regularity, generalization ability, and expressiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce Chat2SVG, a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and image diffusion models for text-to-SVG generation. Our approach first uses an LLM to generate semantically meaningful SVG templates from basic geometric primitives. Guided by image diffusion models, a dual-stage optimization pipeline refines paths in latent space and adjusts point coordinates to enhance geometric complexity. Extensive experiments show that Chat2SVG outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity, path regularity, and semantic alignment. Additionally, our system enables intuitive editing through natural language instructions, making professional vector graphics creation accessible to all users.|Ronghuan Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16602)|null|

However, traditional methods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging subtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where LLMs are leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based judgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging field. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output perspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore LLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to judge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and highlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable insights and inspire future research in this promising research area.

Recent advancements in explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have shown promise in enabling human-like decision-making. Notably, significant developments have occurred in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the decision-making of complex systems, such as self-driving cars. The textual and somewhat ambiguous nature of COLREGs (from an algorithmic perspective), however, poses challenges that align well with the capabilities of LLMs, suggesting that LLMs may become increasingly suitable for this application soon. This paper presents and demonstrates the first application of LLM-based decision-making and control for ASVs. The proposed method establishes a high-level decision-maker that uses online collision risk indices and key measurements to make decisions for safe manoeuvres. A tailored design and runtime structure is developed to support training and real-time action generation on a realistic ASV model. Local planning and control algorithms are integrated to execute the commands for waypoint following and collision avoidance at a lower level. To the authors' knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to apply explainable AI to the dynamic control problem of maritime systems recognising the COLREGs rules, opening new avenues for research in this challenging area. Results obtained across multiple test scenarios demonstrate the system's ability to maintain online COLREGs compliance, accurate waypoint tracking, and feasible control, while providing human-interpretable reasoning for each decision.|Klinsmann Agyei et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16587)|null|

|**2024-11-25**|**Enhancing LLM Reasoning via Critique Models with Test-Time and Training-Time Supervision**|Training large language models (LLMs) to spend more time thinking and reflection before responding is crucial for effectively solving complex reasoning tasks in fields such as science, coding, and mathematics. However, the effectiveness of mechanisms like self-reflection and self-correction depends on the model's capacity to accurately assess its own performance, which can be limited by factors such as initial accuracy, question difficulty, and the lack of external feedback. In this paper, we delve into a two-player paradigm that separates the roles of reasoning and critique models, where the critique model provides step-level feedback to supervise the reasoning (actor) model during both test-time and train-time. We first propose AutoMathCritique, an automated and scalable framework for collecting critique data, resulting in a dataset of $76,321$ responses paired with step-level feedback. Fine-tuning language models with this dataset enables them to generate natural language feedback for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate that the critique models consistently improve the actor's performance on difficult queries at test-time, especially when scaling up inference-time computation. Motivated by these findings, we introduce the critique-based supervision to the actor's self-training process, and propose a critique-in-the-loop self-improvement method. Experiments show that the method improves the actor's exploration efficiency and solution diversity, especially on challenging queries, leading to a stronger reasoning model. Lastly, we take the preliminary step to explore training self-talk reasoning models via critique supervision and showcase its potential.

|**2024-11-22**|**WildLMa: Long Horizon Loco-Manipulation in the Wild**|`In-the-wild' mobile manipulation aims to deploy robots in diverse real-world environments, which requires the robot to (1) have skills that generalize across object configurations; (2) be capable of long-horizon task execution in diverse environments; and (3) perform complex manipulation beyond pick-and-place. Quadruped robots with manipulators hold promise for extending the workspace and enabling robust locomotion, but existing results do not investigate such a capability. This paper proposes WildLMa with three components to address these issues: (1) adaptation of learned low-level controller for VR-enabled whole-body teleoperation and traversability; (2) WildLMa-Skill -- a library of generalizable visuomotor skills acquired via imitation learning or heuristics and (3) WildLMa-Planner -- an interface of learned skills that allow LLM planners to coordinate skills for long-horizon tasks. We demonstrate the importance of high-quality training data by achieving higher grasping success rate over existing RL baselines using only tens of demonstrations. WildLMa exploits CLIP for language-conditioned imitation learning that empirically generalizes to objects unseen in training demonstrations. Besides extensive quantitative evaluation, we qualitatively demonstrate practical robot applications, such as cleaning up trash in university hallways or outdoor terrains, operating articulated objects, and rearranging items on a bookshelf.|Ri-Zhao Qiu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15131)|null|

In this paper, we offer a rigorous investigation of this topic, identifying how the phenomenon has arisen, and how it might be analysed. In this paper, we elaborate on this argument to propose that LLM-based chatbots play the 'language game of bullshit'. We use statistical text analysis to investigate the features of this Wittgensteinian language game, based on a dataset constructed to contrast the language of 1,000 scientific publications with typical pseudo-scientific text generated by ChatGPT. We then explore whether the same language features can be detected in two well-known contexts of social dysfunction: George Orwell's critique of politics and language, and David Graeber's characterisation of bullshit jobs. Using simple hypothesis-testing methods, we demonstrate that a statistical model of the language of bullshit can reliably relate the Frankfurtian artificial bullshit of ChatGPT to the political and workplace functions of bullshit as observed in natural human language.|Alessandro Trevisan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15129)|null|

The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.|Fengyuan Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15102)|**[link](https://github.com/r-three/AttriBoT)**|

These developments bring significant demands for structured generation in LLM inference. Context-free grammar is a flexible approach to enable structured generation via constrained decoding. However, executing context-free grammar requires going through several stack states over all tokens in vocabulary during runtime, bringing non-negligible overhead for structured generation. In this paper, we propose XGrammar, a flexible and efficient structure generation engine for large language models. XGrammar accelerates context-free grammar execution by dividing the vocabulary into context-independent tokens that can be prechecked and context-dependent tokens that need to be interpreted during runtime. We further build transformations to expand the grammar context and reduce the number of context-independent tokens. Additionally, we build an efficient persistent stack to accelerate the context-dependent token checks. Finally, we co-design the grammar engine with LLM inference engine to overlap grammar computation with GPU executions. Evaluation results show that XGrammar can achieve up to 100x speedup over existing solutions. Combined with an LLM inference engine, it can generate near-zero overhead structure generation in end-to-end low-LLM serving.|Yixin Dong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15100)|null|

Thus, multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) is naturally introduced to provide MLLMs with comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge, effectively expanding the knowledge scope. However, current mRAG methods have inherent drawbacks, including: 1) Performing retrieval even when external knowledge is not needed. 2) Lacking of identification of evidence that supports the query. 3) Increasing model complexity due to additional information filtering modules or rules. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel generalized framework called \textbf{m}ultimodal \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{R}eflection-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{G}eneration (mR$^2$AG), which achieves adaptive retrieval and useful information localization to enable answers through two easy-to-implement reflection operations, preventing high model complexity. In mR$^2$AG, Retrieval-Reflection is designed to distinguish different user queries and avoids redundant retrieval calls, and Relevance-Reflection is introduced to guide the MLLM in locating beneficial evidence of the retrieved content and generating answers accordingly. In addition, mR$^2$AG can be integrated into any well-trained MLLM with efficient fine-tuning on the proposed mR$^2$AG Instruction-Tuning dataset (mR$^2$AG-IT). mR$^2$ AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4v/o) and RAG-based MLLMs on INFOSEEK and Encyclopedic-VQA, while maintaining the exceptional capabilities of base MLLMs across a wide range of Visual-dependent tasks.|Tao Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15041)|null|
|**2024-11-22**|**One to rule them all: natural language to bind communication, perception and action**|In recent years, research in the area of human-robot interaction has focused on developing robots capable of understanding complex human instructions and performing tasks in dynamic and diverse environments. These systems have a wide range of applications, from personal assistance to industrial robotics, emphasizing the importance of robots interacting flexibly, naturally and safely with humans. This paper presents an advanced architecture for robotic action planning that integrates communication, perception, and planning with Large Language Models (LLMs). Our system is designed to translate commands expressed in natural language into executable robot actions, incorporating environmental information and dynamically updating plans based on real-time feedback. The Planner Module is the core of the system where LLMs embedded in a modified ReAct framework are employed to interpret and carry out user commands. By leveraging their extensive pre-trained knowledge, LLMs can effectively process user requests without the need to introduce new knowledge on the changing environment. The modified ReAct framework further enhances the execution space by providing real-time environmental perception and the outcomes of physical actions. By combining robust and dynamic semantic map representations as graphs with control components and failure explanations, this architecture enhances a robot adaptability, task execution, and seamless collaboration with human users in shared and dynamic environments. Through the integration of continuous feedback loops with the environment the system can dynamically adjusts the plan to accommodate unexpected changes, optimizing the robot ability to perform tasks. Using a dataset of previous experience is possible to provide detailed feedback about the failure.

As a result, interactions with robots must be simple and intuitive, with robots perception adapting efficiently to human-induced changes. This paper presents a robot control architecture that addresses key challenges in human-robot interaction, with a particular focus on the dynamic creation and continuous update of the robot state representation. The architecture uses Large Language Models to integrate diverse information sources, including natural language commands, robotic skills representation, real-time dynamic semantic mapping of the perceived scene. This enables flexible and adaptive robotic behavior in complex, dynamic environments. Traditional robotic systems often rely on static, pre-programmed instructions and settings, limiting their adaptability to dynamic environments and real-time collaboration. In contrast, this architecture uses LLMs to interpret complex, high-level instructions and generate actionable plans that enhance human-robot collaboration. At its core, the system Perception Module generates and continuously updates a semantic scene graph using RGB-D sensor data, providing a detailed and structured representation of the environment. A particle filter is employed to ensure accurate object localization in dynamic, real-world settings. The Planner Module leverages this up-to-date semantic map to break down high-level tasks into sub-tasks and link them to robotic skills such as navigation, object manipulation (e.g., PICK and PLACE), and movement (e.g., GOTO). By combining real-time perception, state tracking, and LLM-driven communication and task planning, the architecture enhances adaptability, task efficiency, and human-robot collaboration in dynamic environments.|Simone Colombani et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15027)|null|

We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.|Keda Tao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15024)|null|

Despite various efforts to improve LLM reasoning, high-quality long-chain reasoning data and optimized training pipelines still remain inadequately explored in vision-language tasks. In this paper, we present Insight-V, an early effort to 1) scalably produce long and robust reasoning data for complex multi-modal tasks, and 2) an effective training pipeline to enhance the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, to create long and structured reasoning data without human labor, we design a two-step pipeline with a progressive strategy to generate sufficiently long and diverse reasoning paths and a multi-granularity assessment method to ensure data quality. We observe that directly supervising MLLMs with such long and complex reasoning data will not yield ideal reasoning ability. To tackle this problem, we design a multi-agent system consisting of a reasoning agent dedicated to performing long-chain reasoning and a summary agent trained to judge and summarize reasoning results. We further incorporate an iterative DPO algorithm to enhance the reasoning agent's generation stability and quality. Based on the popular LLaVA-NeXT model and our stronger base MLLM, we demonstrate significant performance gains across challenging multi-modal benchmarks requiring visual reasoning.

Traditional video processing methods rely heavily on fine-tuning to capture nuanced spatial-temporal details, which incurs significant data and computation costs. In contrast, training-free approaches, though efficient, often lack robustness in preserving context-rich features across complex video content. To this end, we propose DYTO, a novel dynamic token merging framework for zero-shot video understanding that adaptively optimizes token efficiency while preserving crucial scene details. DYTO integrates a hierarchical frame selection and a bipartite token merging strategy to dynamically cluster key frames and selectively compress token sequences, striking a balance between computational efficiency with semantic richness. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DYTO, achieving superior performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods and setting a new state-of-the-art for zero-shot video understanding.|Yiming Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14401)|null|
|**2024-11-21**|**Lightweight Safety Guardrails Using Fine-tuned BERT Embeddings**|With the recent proliferation of large language models (LLMs), enterprises have been able to rapidly develop proof-of-concepts and prototypes. As a result, there is a growing need to implement robust guardrails that monitor, quantize and control an LLM's behavior, ensuring that the use is reliable, safe, accurate and also aligned with the users' expectations. Previous approaches for filtering out inappropriate user prompts or system outputs, such as LlamaGuard and OpenAI's MOD API, have achieved significant success by fine-tuning existing LLMs. However, using fine-tuned LLMs as guardrails introduces increased latency and higher maintenance costs, which may not be practical or scalable for cost-efficient deployments. We take a different approach, focusing on fine-tuning a lightweight architecture: Sentence-BERT. This method reduces the model size from LlamaGuard's 7 billion parameters to approximately 67 million, while maintaining comparable performance on the AEGIS safety benchmark.|Aaron Zheng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14398)|null|

We present a method to efficiently collect text data for low-resource languages from the entire Common Crawl corpus. Our approach, UnifiedCrawl, filters and extracts common crawl using minimal compute resources, yielding mono-lingual datasets much larger than previously available sources. We demonstrate that leveraging this data to fine-tuning multilingual LLMs via efficient adapter methods (QLoRA) significantly boosts performance on the low-resource language, while minimizing VRAM usage. Our experiments show large improvements in language modeling perplexity and an increase in few-shot prompting scores.

In general, previous efforts resort to sampling training data from different domains with static proportions, as well as adjusting data proportions during training. However, few methods have addressed the complexities of domain-adaptive continual pre-training. To fill this gap, we propose Velocitune, a novel framework dynamically assesses learning velocity and adjusts data proportions accordingly, favoring slower-learning domains while shunning faster-learning ones, which is guided by a scaling law to indicate the desired learning goal for each domain with less associated cost. To evaluate the effectiveness of Velocitune, we conduct experiments in a reasoning-focused dataset with CodeLlama, as well as in a corpus specialised for system command generation with Llama3 and Mistral. Velocitune achieves performance gains in both math and code reasoning tasks and command-line generation benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that key factors driving Velocitune's effectiveness include target loss prediction and data ordering.|Zheheng Luo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14318)|null|
|**2024-11-21**|**Automated Generation of Code Debugging Exercises**|Debugging is an essential skill when learning to program, yet its instruction and emphasis often vary widely across introductory courses. In the era of code-generating large language models (LLMs), the ability for students to reason about code and identify errors is increasingly important. However, students frequently resort to trial-and-error methods to resolve bugs without fully understanding the underlying issues. Developing the ability to identify and hypothesize the cause of bugs is crucial but can be time-consuming to teach effectively through traditional means. This paper introduces BugSpotter, an innovative tool that leverages an LLM to generate buggy code from a problem description and verify the synthesized bugs via a test suite. Students interact with BugSpotter by designing failing test cases, where the buggy code's output differs from the expected result as defined by the problem specification. This not only provides opportunities for students to enhance their debugging skills, but also to practice reading and understanding problem specifications. We deployed BugSpotter in a large classroom setting and compared the debugging exercises it generated to exercises hand-crafted by an instructor for the same problems. We found that the LLM-generated exercises produced by BugSpotter varied in difficulty and were well-matched to the problem specifications. Importantly, the LLM-generated exercises were comparable to those manually created by instructors with respect to student performance, suggesting that BugSpotter could be an effective and efficient aid for learning debugging.|Victor-Alexandru Pădurean et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14303)|null|

It addresses a long-standing challenge in automating netlist generation for analog circuits within circuit design automation. Automating this workflow could accelerate the creation of finetuned LLMs for analog circuit design and verification. We identify key challenges in this automation and evaluate the multi-modal capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, particularly GPT-4, to address these issues. We propose a three-step workflow to overcome current limitations: labeling analog circuits, prompt tuning, and netlist verification. This approach aims to create an end-to-end SPICE netlist generator from circuit schematic images, tackling the long-standing hurdle of accurate netlist generation. Our framework demonstrates significant performance improvements, tested on approximately 2,100 schematics of varying complexity.

|**2024-11-21**|**CAIP: Detecting Router Misconfigurations with Context-Aware Iterative Prompting of LLMs**|Model checkers and consistency checkers detect critical errors in router configurations, but these tools require significant manual effort to develop and maintain. LLM-based Q&A models have emerged as a promising alternative, allowing users to query partitions of configurations through prompts and receive answers based on learned patterns, thanks to transformer models pre-trained on vast datasets that provide generic configuration context for interpreting router configurations. Yet, current methods of partition-based prompting often do not provide enough network-specific context from the actual configurations to enable accurate inference. We introduce a Context-Aware Iterative Prompting (CAIP) framework that automates network-specific context extraction and optimizes LLM prompts for more precise router misconfiguration detection. CAIP addresses three challenges: (1) efficiently mining relevant context from complex configuration files, (2) accurately distinguishing between pre-defined and user-defined parameter values to prevent irrelevant context from being introduced, and (3) managing prompt context overload with iterative, guided interactions with the model. Our evaluations on synthetic and real-world configurations show that CAIP improves misconfiguration detection accuracy by more than 30% compared to partition-based LLM approaches, model checkers, and consistency checkers, uncovering over 20 previously undetected misconfigurations in real-world configurations.|Xi Jiang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14283)|null|
|**2024-11-21**|**Looking Beyond Text: Reducing Language bias in Large Vision-Language Models via Multimodal Dual-Attention and Soft-Image Guidance**|Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results in various vision-language tasks. However, despite showing promising performance, LVLMs suffer from hallucinations caused by language bias, leading to diminished focus on images and ineffective visual comprehension. We identify two primary reasons for this bias: 1. Different scales of training data between the pretraining stage of LLM and multimodal alignment stage. 2. The learned inference bias due to short-term dependency of text data. Therefore, we propose LACING, a systemic framework designed to address the language bias of LVLMs with muLtimodal duAl-attention meChanIsm (MDA) aNd soft-image Guidance (IFG). Specifically, MDA introduces a parallel dual-attention mechanism that enhances the integration of visual inputs across the model. IFG introduces a learnable soft visual prompt during training and inference to replace visual inputs, designed to compel LVLMs to prioritize text inputs. Then, IFG further proposes a novel decoding strategy using the soft visual prompt to mitigate the model's over-reliance on adjacent text inputs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively debiases LVLMs from their language bias, enhancing visual comprehension and reducing hallucinations without requiring additional training resources or data.

In this context, Aspect-Based Summarization (ABS) systems that extract and summarize relevant information are particularly useful as they provide stakeholders with a convenient way of finding relevant information in expert-curated reports. In this work, we release a new dataset for ABS of Climate Change reports and we employ different Large Language Models (LLMs) and so-called Small Language Models (SLMs) to tackle this problem in an unsupervised way. Considering the problem at hand, we also show how SLMs are not significantly worse for the problem while leading to reduced carbon footprint; we do so by applying for the first time an existing framework considering both energy efficiency and task performance to the evaluation of zero-shot generative models for ABS. Overall, our results show that modern language models, both big and small, can effectively tackle ABS for Climate Change reports but more research is needed when we frame the problem as a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) problem and our work and dataset will help foster efforts in this direction.|Iacopo Ghinassi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14272)|**[link](https://github.com/ighina/llmclimate2024)**|

Since the output from LLMs propagate to downstream steps, identifying LLM errors is crucial to system performance. A common task for LLMs in AI systems is tool use. While there are several benchmark environments for evaluating LLMs on this task, they typically only give a success rate without any explanation of the failure cases. To solve this problem, we introduce SpecTool, a new benchmark to identify error patterns in LLM output on tool-use tasks. Our benchmark data set comprises of queries from diverse environments that can be used to test for the presence of seven newly characterized error patterns. Using SPECTOOL , we show that even the most prominent LLMs exhibit these error patterns in their outputs.

Real-world tasks require handling intricate interactions, advanced spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous exploration of new strategies-areas in which we lack effective methodologies for comprehensively evaluating these capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce BALROG, a novel benchmark designed to assess the agentic capabilities of LLMs and VLMs through a diverse set of challenging games. Our benchmark incorporates a range of existing reinforcement learning environments with varying levels of difficulty, including tasks that are solvable by non-expert humans in seconds to extremely challenging ones that may take years to master (e.g., the NetHack Learning Environment). We devise fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct an extensive evaluation of several popular open-source and closed-source LLMs and VLMs. Our findings indicate that while current models achieve partial success in the easier games, they struggle significantly with more challenging tasks. Notably, we observe severe deficiencies in vision-based decision-making, as models perform worse when visual representations of the environments are provided. We release BALROG as an open and user-friendly benchmark to facilitate future research and development in the agentic community.|Davide Paglieri et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13543)|null|
|**2024-11-20**|**Metacognition for Unknown Situations and Environments (MUSE)**|Metacognition--the awareness and regulation of one's cognitive processes--is central to human adaptability in unknown situations. In contrast, current autonomous agents often struggle in novel environments due to their limited capacity for adaptation. We hypothesize that metacognition is a critical missing ingredient in adaptive autonomous systems, equipping them with the cognitive flexibility needed to tackle unfamiliar challenges. Given the broad scope of metacognitive abilities, we focus on two key aspects: competence awareness and strategy selection for novel tasks. To this end, we propose the Metacognition for Unknown Situations and Environments (MUSE) framework, which integrates metacognitive processes--specifically self-awareness and self-regulation--into autonomous agents. We present two initial implementations of MUSE: one based on world modeling and another leveraging large language models (LLMs), both instantiating the metacognitive cycle. Our system continuously learns to assess its competence on a given task and uses this self-awareness to guide iterative cycles of strategy selection. MUSE agents show significant improvements in self-awareness and self-regulation, enabling them to solve novel, out-of-distribution tasks more effectively compared to Dreamer-v3-based reinforcement learning and purely prompt-based LLM agent approaches. This work highlights the promise of approaches inspired by cognitive and neural systems in enabling autonomous systems to adapt to new environments, overcoming the limitations of current methods that rely heavily on extensive training data.|Rodolfo Valiente et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13537)|null|

Arabic, with its complex morphology, syntax, and diglossia, poses unique challenges for natural language processing (NLP) in medical contexts. This case study evaluates Sporo AraSum, a language model tailored for Arabic clinical documentation, against JAIS, the leading Arabic NLP model. Using synthetic datasets and modified PDQI-9 metrics modified ourselves for the purposes of assessing model performances in a different language. The study assessed the models' performance in summarizing patient-physician interactions, focusing on accuracy, comprehensiveness, clinical utility, and linguistic-cultural competence.   Results indicate that Sporo AraSum significantly outperforms JAIS in AI-centric quantitative metrics and all qualitative attributes measured in our modified version of the PDQI-9. AraSum's architecture enables precise and culturally sensitive documentation, addressing the linguistic nuances of Arabic while mitigating risks of AI hallucinations. These findings suggest that Sporo AraSum is better suited to meet the demands of Arabic-speaking healthcare environments, offering a transformative solution for multilingual clinical workflows. Future research should incorporate real-world data to further validate these findings and explore broader integration into healthcare systems.|Chanseo Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13518)|null|
|**2024-11-21**|**Disentangling Memory and Reasoning Ability in Large Language Models**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in handling complex tasks requiring both extensive knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, the existing LLM inference pipeline operates as an opaque process without explicit separation between knowledge retrieval and reasoning steps, making the model's decision-making process unclear and disorganized. This ambiguity can lead to issues such as hallucinations and knowledge forgetting, which significantly impact the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we propose a new inference paradigm that decomposes the complex inference process into two distinct and clear actions: (1) memory recall: which retrieves relevant knowledge, and (2) reasoning: which performs logical steps based on the recalled knowledge. To facilitate this decomposition, we introduce two special tokens memory and reason, guiding the model to distinguish between steps that require knowledge retrieval and those that involve reasoning. Our experiment results show that this decomposition not only improves model performance but also enhances the interpretability of the inference process, enabling users to identify sources of error and refine model responses effectively.

Predicting what claims of the invention should change given the prior art is an essential and crucial step in securing invention rights, yet has not been studied before as a learnable task. In this work we introduce the PatentEdits dataset, which contains 105K examples of successful revisions that overcome objections to novelty. We design algorithms to label edits sentence by sentence, then establish how well these edits can be predicted with large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that evaluating textual entailment between cited references and draft sentences is especially effective in predicting which inventive claims remained unchanged or are novel in relation to prior art.|Ryan Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13477)|null|
|**2024-11-20**|**When Precision Meets Position: BFloat16 Breaks Down RoPE in Long-Context Training**|Extending context window sizes allows large language models (LLMs) to process longer sequences and handle more complex tasks. Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) has become the de facto standard due to its relative positional encoding properties that benefit long-context training. However, we observe that using RoPE with BFloat16 format results in numerical issues, causing it to deviate from its intended relative positional encoding, especially in long-context scenarios. This issue arises from BFloat16's limited precision and accumulates as context length increases, with the first token contributing significantly to this problem. To address this, we develop AnchorAttention, a plug-and-play attention method that alleviates numerical issues caused by BFloat16, improves long-context capabilities, and speeds up training. AnchorAttention reduces unnecessary attention computations, maintains semantic coherence, and boosts computational efficiency by treating the first token as a shared anchor with a consistent position ID, making it visible to all documents within the training context. Experiments on three types of LLMs demonstrate that AnchorAttention significantly improves long-context performance and reduces training time by over 50\% compared to standard full attention mechanisms, while preserving the original LLM's capabilities on general tasks.

The wide range of attack vectors identified in prior research - targeting various software and hardware components used in training and inference - makes it extremely challenging to enforce confidentiality and integrity policies.   As we advance towards constructing compound AI inference pipelines that integrate multiple large language models (LLMs), the attack surfaces expand significantly. Attackers now focus on the AI algorithms as well as the software and hardware components associated with these systems. While current research often examines these elements in isolation, we find that combining cross-layer attack observations can enable powerful end-to-end attacks with minimal assumptions about the threat model. Given, the sheer number of existing attacks at each layer, we need a holistic and systemized understanding of different attack vectors at each layer.   This SoK discusses different software and hardware attacks applicable to compound AI systems and demonstrates how combining multiple attack mechanisms can reduce the threat model assumptions required for an isolated attack. Next, we systematize the ML attacks in lines with the Mitre Att&ck framework to better position each attack based on the threat model. Finally, we outline the existing countermeasures for both software and hardware layers and discuss the necessity of a comprehensive defense strategy to enable the secure and high-performance deployment of compound AI systems.|Sarbartha Banerjee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13459)|null|

Current strategies for building web agents rely on (i) the generalizability of underlying MLLMs and their steerability via prompting, and (ii) large-scale fine-tuning of MLLMs on web-related tasks. However, web agents still struggle to automate tasks on unseen websites and domains, limiting their applicability to enterprise-specific and proprietary platforms. Beyond generalization from large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning, we propose building agents for few-shot adaptability using human demonstrations. We introduce the AdaptAgent framework that enables both proprietary and open-weights multimodal web agents to adapt to new websites and domains using few human demonstrations (up to 2). Our experiments on two popular benchmarks -- Mind2Web & VisualWebArena -- show that using in-context demonstrations (for proprietary models) or meta-adaptation demonstrations (for meta-learned open-weights models) boosts task success rate by 3.36% to 7.21% over non-adapted state-of-the-art models, corresponding to a relative increase of 21.03% to 65.75%. Furthermore, our additional analyses (a) show the effectiveness of multimodal demonstrations over text-only ones, (b) shed light on the influence of different data selection strategies during meta-learning on the generalization of the agent, and (c) demonstrate the effect of number of few-shot examples on the web agent's success rate. Overall, our results unlock a complementary axis for developing widely applicable multimodal web agents beyond large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning, emphasizing few-shot adaptability.|Gaurav Verma et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13451)|null|

This study explores the utilization of machine learning and natural language processing, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and BERT, to detect news that are fake. We employ three distinct text vectorization methods for SVM: Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec, and Bag of Words (BoW) evaluating their effectiveness in distinguishing between genuine and fake news. Additionally, we compare these methods against the transformer large language model, BERT. Our comprehensive approach includes detailed preprocessing steps, rigorous model implementation, and thorough evaluation to determine the most effective techniques. The results demonstrate that while BERT achieves superior accuracy with 99.98% and an F1-score of 0.9998, the SVM model with a linear kernel and BoW vectorization also performs exceptionally well, achieving 99.81% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9980. These findings highlight that, despite BERT's superior performance, SVM models with BoW and TF-IDF vectorization methods come remarkably close, offering highly competitive performance with the advantage of lower computational requirements.|Ahmed Akib Jawad Karim et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12703)|null|

While several backdoor attack methods have been proposed, the mechanisms by which backdoor functions operate in LLMs remain underexplored. In this paper, we move beyond attacking LLMs and investigate backdoor functionality through the novel lens of natural language explanations. Specifically, we leverage LLMs' generative capabilities to produce human-understandable explanations for their decisions, allowing us to compare explanations for clean and poisoned samples. We explore various backdoor attacks and embed the backdoor into LLaMA models for multiple tasks. Our experiments show that backdoored models produce higher-quality explanations for clean data compared to poisoned data, while generating significantly more consistent explanations for poisoned data than for clean data. We further analyze the explanation generation process, revealing that at the token level, the explanation token of poisoned samples only appears in the final few transformer layers of the LLM. At the sentence level, attention dynamics indicate that poisoned inputs shift attention from the input context when generating the explanation. These findings deepen our understanding of backdoor attack mechanisms in LLMs and offer a framework for detecting such vulnerabilities through explainability techniques, contributing to the development of more secure LLMs.|Huaizhi Ge et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12701)|null|

However, taking full advantage of it required training a predictor to estimate this sparsity. In this paper, we introduce SparseInfer, a simple, light weight, and training free predictor for activation sparsity of ReLU field LLMs, in which activation sparsity is predicted by comparing only the sign bits of inputs and weights. To compensate for possible prediction inaccuracy, an adaptive tuning of the predictor's conservativeness is enabled, which can also serve as a control knob for optimizing LLM inference.

The research enabled us to create a novel framework that we have developed for Learner Systems. Leveraging art of Large models to create key features including: - Real-time translation between these two sign languages in an efficient manner. Making LLM's capability available for seamless translations to ISL. Here is the full study showing its implementation in this paper. The core of the system is a sophisticated pipeline that begins with reclassification and recognition of ASL gestures based on a strong Random Forest Classifier. By recognizing the ASL, it is translated into text which can be more easily processed. Highly evolved natural language NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques come in handy as they play a role in our LLM integration where you then use LLMs to be able to convert the ASL text to ISL which provides you with the intent of sentence or phrase. The final step is to synthesize the translated text back into ISL gestures, creating an end-to-end translation experience using RIFE-Net. This framework is tasked with key challenges such as automatically dealing with gesture variability and overcoming the linguistic differences between ASL and ISL.

|**2024-11-19**|**Neurosymbolic Graph Enrichment for Grounded World Models**|The development of artificial intelligence systems capable of understanding and reasoning about complex real-world scenarios is a significant challenge. In this work we present a novel approach to enhance and exploit LLM reactive capability to address complex problems and interpret deeply contextual real-world meaning. We introduce a method and a tool for creating a multimodal, knowledge-augmented formal representation of meaning that combines the strengths of large language models with structured semantic representations. Our method begins with an image input, utilizing state-of-the-art large language models to generate a natural language description. This description is then transformed into an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph, which is formalized and enriched with logical design patterns, and layered semantics derived from linguistic and factual knowledge bases. The resulting graph is then fed back into the LLM to be extended with implicit knowledge activated by complex heuristic learning, including semantic implicatures, moral values, embodied cognition, and metaphorical representations. By bridging the gap between unstructured language models and formal semantic structures, our method opens new avenues for tackling intricate problems in natural language understanding and reasoning.|Stefano De Giorgis et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12671)|null|

Most text retrieval systems are tailored for natural language queries, often neglecting the specific challenges of retrieving code. This gap leaves existing models unable to effectively capture the diversity of programming languages and tasks across different domains, highlighting the need for more focused research in code retrieval. To address this, we introduce CodeXEmbed, a family of large-scale code embedding models ranging from 400M to 7B parameters. Our novel training pipeline unifies multiple programming languages and transforms various code-related tasks into a common retrieval framework, enhancing model generalizability and retrieval performance. Our 7B model sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in code retrieval, outperforming the previous leading model, Voyage-Code, by over 20% on CoIR benchmark. In addition to excelling in code retrieval, our models demonstrate competitive performance on the widely adopted BeIR text retrieval benchmark, offering versatility across domains. Experimental results demonstrate that improving retrieval performance significantly enhances end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) performance for code-related tasks.|Ye Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12644)|null|
|**2024-11-19**|**AdaCM $^2$: On Understanding Extremely Long-Term Video with Adaptive Cross-Modality Memory Reduction**|The advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled the improvement of video understanding tasks by incorporating LLMs with visual models. However, most existing LLM-based models (e.g., VideoLLaMA, VideoChat) are constrained to processing short-duration videos. Recent attempts to understand long-term videos by extracting and compressing visual features into a fixed memory size. Nevertheless, those methods leverage only visual modality to merge video tokens and overlook the correlation between visual and textual queries, leading to difficulties in effectively handling complex question-answering tasks. To address the challenges of long videos and complex prompts, we propose AdaCM$^2$, which, for the first time, introduces an adaptive cross-modality memory reduction approach to video-text alignment in an auto-regressive manner on video streams. Our extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as video captioning, video question answering, and video classification, demonstrate that AdaCM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets while significantly reducing memory usage. Notably, it achieves a 4.5% improvement across multiple tasks in the LVU dataset with a GPU memory consumption reduction of up to 65%.|Yuanbin Man et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12593)|null|
|**2024-11-18**|**Generative World Explorer**|Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state.In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.|Taiming Lu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844)|null|

In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a scalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient large language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B. Bi-Mamba models are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using an autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experimental results on language modeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its full-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than post-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing memory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model.

|**2024-11-18**|**BitMoD: Bit-serial Mixture-of-Datatype LLM Acceleration**|Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various machine learning tasks. Yet the substantial memory footprint of LLMs significantly hinders their deployment. In this paper, we improve the accessibility of LLMs through BitMoD, an algorithm-hardware co-design solution that enables efficient LLM acceleration at low weight precision. On the algorithm side, BitMoD introduces fine-grained data type adaptation that uses a different numerical data type to quantize a group of (e.g., 128) weights. Through the careful design of these new data types, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to very low precision (e.g., 4 bits and 3 bits) while maintaining high accuracy. On the hardware side, BitMoD employs a bit-serial processing element to easily support multiple numerical precisions and data types; our hardware design includes two key innovations: First, it employs a unified representation to process different weight data types, thus reducing the hardware cost. Second, it adopts a bit-serial dequantization unit to rescale the per-group partial sum with minimal hardware overhead. Our evaluation on six representative LLMs demonstrates that BitMoD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM quantization and acceleration methods. For discriminative tasks, BitMoD can quantize LLM weights to 4-bit with $<\!0.5\%$ accuracy loss on average. For generative tasks, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to 3-bit while achieving better perplexity than prior LLM quantization scheme. Combining the superior model performance with an efficient accelerator design, BitMoD achieves an average of $1.69\times$ and $1.48\times$ speedups compared to prior LLM accelerators ANT and OliVe, respectively.|Yuzong Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11745)|null|

Our study is based on two experiments designed to assess the susceptibility of LLMs to moral persuasion. In the first experiment, we examine the susceptibility to moral ambiguity by evaluating a Base Agent LLM on morally ambiguous scenarios and observing how a Persuader Agent attempts to modify the Base Agent's initial decisions. The second experiment evaluates the susceptibility of LLMs to align with predefined ethical frameworks by prompting them to adopt specific value alignments rooted in established philosophical theories. The results demonstrate that LLMs can indeed be persuaded in morally charged scenarios, with the success of persuasion depending on factors such as the model used, the complexity of the scenario, and the conversation length. Notably, LLMs of distinct sizes but from the same company produced markedly different outcomes, highlighting the variability in their susceptibility to ethical persuasion.|Allison Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11731)|null|

To address this challenge, we propose a skill library framework based on knowledge graphs, which endows robots with high-level skill awareness and spatial semantic understanding. The framework hierarchically organizes operational knowledge by constructing a "task graph" and a "scene graph" to represent task and scene semantic information, respectively. We introduce a "state graph" to facilitate interaction between high-level task planning and low-level scene information. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical transfer framework for operational skills. At the task level, the framework integrates contextual learning and chain-of-thought prompting within a four-stage prompt paradigm, leveraging large language models' (LLMs) reasoning and generalization capabilities to achieve task-level subtask sequence transfer. At the motion level, an adaptive trajectory transfer method is developed using the A* algorithm and the skill library, enabling motion-level adaptive trajectory transfer. At the physical level, we introduce an adaptive contour extraction and posture perception method based on tactile perception. This method dynamically obtains high-precision contour and posture information from visual-tactile texture data and adjusts transferred skills, such as contact positions and postures, to ensure effectiveness in new environments. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

To address this, we propose FedCoLLM, a novel and parameter-efficient federated framework designed for co-tuning LLMs and SLMs. This approach is aimed at adaptively transferring server-side LLMs knowledge to clients' SLMs while simultaneously enriching the LLMs with domain insights from the clients. To accomplish this, FedCoLLM utilizes lightweight adapters in conjunction with SLMs, facilitating knowledge exchange between server and clients in a manner that respects data privacy while also minimizing computational and communication overhead. Our evaluation of FedCoLLM, utilizing various public LLMs and SLMs across a range of NLP text generation tasks, reveals that the performance of clients' SLMs experiences notable improvements with the assistance of the LLMs. Simultaneously, the LLMs enhanced via FedCoLLM achieves comparable performance to that obtained through direct fine-tuning on clients' data.|Tao Fan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11707)|null|

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-o1, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-o1 independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-o1 to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-o1-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-o1 not only outperforms its base model by 8.9% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.|Guowei Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10440)|null|

Adaptive gradient algorithms like Adam, AdamW, and their variants have been central to this task. Despite the development of numerous variance reduction algorithms in the past decade aimed at accelerating stochastic optimization in both convex and nonconvex settings, variance reduction has not found widespread success in training deep neural networks or large language models. Consequently, it has remained a less favored approach in modern AI. In this paper, to unleash the power of variance reduction for efficient training of large models, we propose a unified optimization framework, MARS (Make vAriance Reduction Shine), which reconciles preconditioned gradient methods with variance reduction via a scaled stochastic recursive momentum technique. Within our framework, we introduce three instances of MARS that leverage preconditioned gradient updates based on AdamW, Lion, and Shampoo, respectively.

Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple hallucination evaluation datasets, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and highlighting the potential of our approach.

However, they often encounter significant challenges due to inadequate alignment for fine-grained knowledge, which restricts their ability to accurately capture local details and attain a comprehensive global perception. While recent advancements have focused on aligning object expressions with grounding information, they typically lack explicit integration of object images, which contain affluent information beyond mere texts or coordinates. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel fine-grained visual knowledge alignment method that effectively aligns and integrates multi-scale knowledge of objects, including texts, coordinates, and images. This innovative method is underpinned by our multi-scale fine-grained enhancement data synthesis pipeline, which provides over 300K essential training data to enhance alignment and improve overall performance.

|**2024-11-14**|**Squeezed Attention: Accelerating Long Context Length LLM Inference**|Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts to perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.|Coleman Hooper et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09688)|null|

|**2024-11-14**|**Local deployment of large-scale music AI models on commodity hardware**|We present the MIDInfinite, a web application capable of generating symbolic music using a large-scale generative AI model locally on commodity hardware. Creating this demo involved porting the Anticipatory Music Transformer, a large language model (LLM) pre-trained on the Lakh MIDI dataset, to the Machine Learning Compilation (MLC) framework. Once the model is ported, MLC facilitates inference on a variety of runtimes including C++, mobile, and the browser. We envision that MLC has the potential to bridge the gap between the landscape of increasingly capable music AI models and technology more familiar to music software developers. As a proof of concept, we build a web application that allows users to generate endless streams of multi-instrumental MIDI in the browser, either from scratch or conditioned on a prompt. On commodity hardware (an M3 Macbook Pro), our demo can generate 51 notes per second, which is faster than real-time playback for 72.9% of generations, and increases to 86.3% with 2 seconds of upfront buffering.|Xun Zhou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09625)|null|
|**2024-11-14**|**PTR: Precision-Driven Tool Recommendation for Large Language Models**|By augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools, their capacity to solve complex problems has been significantly enhanced. However, despite ongoing advancements in the parsing capabilities of LLMs, incorporating all available tools simultaneously in the prompt remains impractical due to the vast number of external tools. Consequently, it is essential to provide LLMs with a precise set of tools tailored to the specific task, considering both quantity and quality. Current tool retrieval methods primarily focus on refining the ranking list of tools and directly packaging a fixed number of top-ranked tools as the tool set. However, these approaches often fail to equip LLMs with the optimal set of tools prior to execution, since the optimal number of tools for different tasks could be different, resulting in inefficiencies such as redundant or unsuitable tools, which impede immediate access to the most relevant tools. This paper addresses the challenge of recommending precise toolsets for LLMs. We introduce the problem of tool recommendation, define its scope, and propose a novel Precision-driven Tool Recommendation (PTR) approach. PTR captures an initial, concise set of tools by leveraging historical tool bundle usage and dynamically adjusts the tool set by performing tool matching, culminating in a multi-view-based tool addition. Additionally, we present a new dataset, RecTools, and a metric, TRACC, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of tool recommendation for LLMs. We further validate our design choices through comprehensive experiments, demonstrating promising accuracy across two open benchmarks and our RecTools dataset.|Hang Gao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09613)|null|
|**2024-11-14**|**The Moral Foundations Weibo Corpus**|Moral sentiments expressed in natural language significantly influence both online and offline environments, shaping behavioral styles and interaction patterns, including social media selfpresentation, cyberbullying, adherence to social norms, and ethical decision-making. To effectively measure moral sentiments in natural language processing texts, it is crucial to utilize large, annotated datasets that provide nuanced understanding for accurate analysis and modeltraining. However, existing corpora, while valuable, often face linguistic limitations. To address this gap in the Chinese language domain,we introduce the Moral Foundation Weibo Corpus. This corpus consists of 25,671 Chinese comments on Weibo, encompassing six diverse topic areas. Each comment is manually annotated by at least three systematically trained annotators based on ten moral categories derived from a grounded theory of morality. To assess annotator reliability, we present the kappa testresults, a gold standard for measuring consistency. Additionally, we apply several the latest large language models to supplement the manual annotations, conducting analytical experiments to compare their performance and report baseline results for moral sentiment classification.|Renjie Cao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09612)|null|

We have identified RAG evaluation as a barrier to continued progress in information access (and more broadly, natural language processing and artificial intelligence), and it is our hope that we can contribute to tackling the many challenges in this space. The central hypothesis we explore in this work is that the nugget evaluation methodology, originally developed for the TREC Question Answering Track in 2003, provides a solid foundation for evaluating RAG systems. As such, our efforts have focused on "refactoring" this methodology, specifically applying large language models to both automatically create nuggets and to automatically assign nuggets to system answers. We call this the AutoNuggetizer framework. Within the TREC setup, we are able to calibrate our fully automatic process against a manual process whereby nuggets are created by human assessors semi-manually and then assigned manually to system answers. Based on initial results across 21 topics from 45 runs, we observe a strong correlation between scores derived from a fully automatic nugget evaluation and a (mostly) manual nugget evaluation by human assessors. This suggests that our fully automatic evaluation process can be used to guide future iterations of RAG systems.|Ronak Pradeep et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09607)|null|

|**2024-11-13**|**The Limited Impact of Medical Adaptation of Large Language and Vision-Language Models**|Several recent works seek to develop foundation models specifically for medical applications, adapting general-purpose large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) via continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) improves performance on downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical licensing exam questions. In this paper, we compare ten public "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning regimes for medical question-answering (QA). For instance, across all tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs only outperform their base models in 22.7% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 36.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in the remaining 40.5% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model head-to-head, directly against the corresponding base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately in zero-/few-shot prompting; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. While these basic practices are not consistently adopted in the literature, our ablations show that they substantially impact conclusions. Meanwhile, we find that after fine-tuning on specific QA tasks, medical LLMs can show performance improvements, but the benefits do not carry over to tasks based on clinical notes. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.|Daniel P.

Unlike traditional methods, which require complex prompt engineering or white-box access, LLMStinger uses a reinforcement learning (RL) loop to fine-tune an attacker LLM, generating new suffixes based on existing attacks for harmful questions from the HarmBench benchmark. Our method significantly outperforms existing red-teaming approaches (we compared against 15 of the latest methods), achieving a +57.2% improvement in Attack Success Rate (ASR) on LLaMA2-7B-chat and a +50.3% ASR increase on Claude 2, both models known for their extensive safety measures. Additionally, we achieved a 94.97% ASR on GPT-3.5 and 99.4% on Gemma-2B-it, demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of LLMStinger across open and closed-source models.|Piyush Jha et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08862)|null|
|**2024-11-13**|**Multimodal Instruction Tuning with Hybrid State Space Models**|Handling lengthy context is crucial for enhancing the recognition and understanding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in applications such as processing high-resolution images or high frame rate videos. The rise in image resolution and frame rate substantially increases computational demands due to the increased number of input tokens. This challenge is further exacerbated by the quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length of the self-attention mechanism. Most prior works either pre-train models with long contexts, overlooking the efficiency problem, or attempt to reduce the context length via downsampling (e.g., identify the key image patches or frames) to decrease the context length, which may result in information loss. To circumvent this issue while keeping the remarkable effectiveness of MLLMs, we propose a novel approach using a hybrid transformer-MAMBA model to efficiently handle long contexts in multimodal applications. Our multimodal model can effectively process long context input exceeding 100k tokens, outperforming existing models across various benchmarks. Remarkably, our model enhances inference efficiency for high-resolution images and high-frame-rate videos by about 4 times compared to current models, with efficiency gains increasing as image resolution or video frames rise. Furthermore, our model is the first to be trained on low-resolution images or low-frame-rate videos while being capable of inference on high-resolution images and high-frame-rate videos, offering flexibility for inference in diverse scenarios.|Jianing Zhou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08840)|null|

|**2024-11-13**|**FinRobot: AI Agent for Equity Research and Valuation with Large Language Models**|As financial markets grow increasingly complex, there is a rising need for automated tools that can effectively assist human analysts in equity research, particularly within sell-side research. While Generative AI (GenAI) has attracted significant attention in this field, existing AI solutions often fall short due to their narrow focus on technical factors and limited capacity for discretionary judgment. These limitations hinder their ability to adapt to new data in real-time and accurately assess risks, which diminishes their practical value for investors.   This paper presents FinRobot, the first AI agent framework specifically designed for equity research. FinRobot employs a multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) system, integrating both quantitative and qualitative analyses to emulate the comprehensive reasoning of a human analyst. The system is structured around three specialized agents: the Data-CoT Agent, which aggregates diverse data sources for robust financial integration; the Concept-CoT Agent, which mimics an analysts reasoning to generate actionable insights; and the Thesis-CoT Agent, which synthesizes these insights into a coherent investment thesis and report. FinRobot provides thorough company analysis supported by precise numerical data, industry-appropriate valuation metrics, and realistic risk assessments. Its dynamically updatable data pipeline ensures that research remains timely and relevant, adapting seamlessly to new financial information. Unlike existing automated research tools, such as CapitalCube and Wright Reports, FinRobot delivers insights comparable to those produced by major brokerage firms and fundamental research vendors.

|**2024-11-13**|**Evaluating World Models with LLM for Decision Making**|World model emerges as a key module in decision making, where MuZero and Dreamer achieve remarkable successes in complex tasks. Recent work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as general world simulators to simulate the dynamics of the world due to their generalizability. LLMs also serve as the world model for deliberative reasoning in Reasoning via Planning (RAP) and Tree of Thought (ToT). However, the world models are either evaluated as a general world simulator, or as a functional module of the agent, i.e., predicting the transitions to assist the planning. In this work, we propose a comprehensive evaluation of the world models with LLMs from the decision making perspective. Specifically, we leverage the 31 diverse environments from (Wang et al., 2023;2024) and curate the rule-based policy of each environment for the diverse evaluation. Then, we design three main tasks, i.e., policy verification, action proposal, and policy planning, where the world models can be used for decision making solely. Finally, we conduct the comprehensive evaluation of the advanced LLMs, i.e., GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, on the environments for the three main tasks under various settings. The key observations include: i) GPT-4o significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini on the three main tasks, especially for the tasks which require the domain knowledge, ii) the performance of the world model with LLM will be decreased for long-term decision-making tasks, and iii) the combination of different functionalities of the world model will brings additional unstabilities of the performance.|Chang Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08794)|null|

However, their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) may offer a potential method to interpret steering vectors, recent findings show that SAE-reconstructed vectors often lack the steering properties of the original vectors. This paper investigates why directly applying SAEs to steering vectors yields misleading decompositions, identifying two reasons: (1) steering vectors fall outside the input distribution for which SAEs are designed, and (2) steering vectors can have meaningful negative projections in feature directions, which SAEs are not designed to accommodate. These limitations hinder the direct use of SAEs for interpreting steering vectors.|Harry Mayne et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08790)|**[link](https://github.com/harrymayne/sv_interpretability)**|
|**2024-11-13**|**Separating Tongue from Thought: Activation Patching Reveals Language-Agnostic Concept Representations in Transformers**|A central question in multilingual language modeling is whether large language models (LLMs) develop a universal concept representation, disentangled from specific languages. In this paper, we address this question by analyzing latent representations (latents) during a word translation task in transformer-based LLMs. We strategically extract latents from a source translation prompt and insert them into the forward pass on a target translation prompt. By doing so, we find that the output language is encoded in the latent at an earlier layer than the concept to be translated. Building on this insight, we conduct two key experiments. First, we demonstrate that we can change the concept without changing the language and vice versa through activation patching alone. Second, we show that patching with the mean over latents across different languages does not impair and instead improves the models' performance in translating the concept. Our results provide evidence for the existence of language-agnostic concept representations within the investigated models.|Clément Dumas et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08745)|**[link](https://github.com/butanium/llm-lang-agnostic)**|

Compared to most studies that focus on continuous speech features, although discrete-token based LLMs have shown promising results on certain tasks, the performance gap between these two paradigms is rarely explored. In this paper, we present a fair and thorough comparison between discrete and continuous features across a variety of semantic-related tasks using a light-weight LLM (Qwen1.5-0.5B). Our findings reveal that continuous features generally outperform discrete tokens, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained semantic understanding. Moreover, this study goes beyond surface-level comparison by identifying key factors behind the under-performance of discrete tokens, such as limited token granularity and inefficient information retention. To enhance the performance of discrete tokens, we explore potential aspects based on our analysis. We hope our results can offer new insights into the opportunities for advancing discrete speech tokens in Speech LLMs.|Dingdong Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08742)|null|
|**2024-11-14**|**Dynamic Rewarding with Prompt Optimization Enables Tuning-free Self-Alignment of Language Models**|Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) traditionally relies on costly training and human preference annotations. Self-alignment seeks to reduce these expenses by enabling models to align themselves. To further lower costs and achieve alignment without any expensive tuning or annotations, we introduce a new tuning-free approach for self-alignment, Dynamic Rewarding with Prompt Optimization (DRPO). Our approach leverages a search-based optimization framework that allows LLMs to iteratively self-improve and craft the optimal alignment instructions, all without additional training or human intervention. The core of DRPO is a dynamic rewarding mechanism, which identifies and rectifies model-specific alignment weaknesses, allowing LLMs to adapt efficiently to diverse alignment challenges. Empirical evaluations on eight recent LLMs, both open- and closed-sourced, demonstrate that DRPO significantly enhances alignment performance, with base models outperforming their SFT/RLHF-tuned counterparts. Moreover, the prompts automatically optimized by DRPO surpass those curated by human experts, further validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings highlight the great potential of current LLMs to achieve adaptive self-alignment through inference-time optimization, complementing tuning-based alignment methods.|Somanshu Singla et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08733)|null|
|**2024-11-12**|**Learning with Less: Knowledge Distillation from Large Language Models via Unlabeled Data**|In real-world NLP applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions due to their extensive training on vast datasets. However, the large size and high computation demands of LLMs limit their practicality in many applications, especially when further fine-tuning is required. To address these limitations, smaller models are typically preferred for deployment. However, their training is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data. In contrast, unlabeled data is often readily which can be leveraged by using LLMs to generate pseudo-labels for training smaller models. This enables the smaller models (student) to acquire knowledge from LLMs(teacher) while reducing computational costs. This process introduces challenges, such as potential noisy pseudo-labels. Selecting high-quality and informative data is therefore critical to enhance model performance while improving the efficiency of data utilization. To address this, we propose LLKD that enables Learning with Less computational resources and less data for Knowledge Distillation from LLMs. LLKD is an adaptive sample selection method that incorporates signals from both the teacher and student. Specifically, it prioritizes samples where the teacher demonstrates high confidence in its labeling, indicating reliable labels, and where the student exhibits a high information need, identifying challenging samples that require further learning. Our comprehensive experiments show that LLKD achieves superior performance across various datasets with higher data efficiency.|Juanhui Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08028)|null|
|**2024-11-12**|**LLMPhy: Complex Physical Reasoning Using Large Language Models and World Models**|Physical reasoning is an important skill needed for robotic agents when operating in the real world. However, solving such reasoning problems often involves hypothesizing and reflecting over complex multi-body interactions under the effect of a multitude of physical forces and thus learning all such interactions poses a significant hurdle for state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, including large language models (LLMs). To study this problem, we propose a new physical reasoning task and a dataset, dubbed TraySim. Our task involves predicting the dynamics of several objects on a tray that is given an external impact -- the domino effect of the ensued object interactions and their dynamics thus offering a challenging yet controlled setup, with the goal of reasoning being to infer the stability of the objects after the impact. To solve this complex physical reasoning task, we present LLMPhy, a zero-shot black-box optimization framework that leverages the physics knowledge and program synthesis abilities of LLMs, and synergizes these abilities with the world models built into modern physics engines. Specifically, LLMPhy uses an LLM to generate code to iteratively estimate the physical hyperparameters of the system (friction, damping, layout, etc.) via an implicit analysis-by-synthesis approach using a (non-differentiable) simulator in the loop and uses the inferred parameters to imagine the dynamics of the scene towards solving the reasoning task. To show the effectiveness of LLMPhy, we present experiments on our TraySim dataset to predict the steady-state poses of the objects. Our results show that the combination of the LLM and the physics engine leads to state-of-the-art zero-shot physical reasoning performance, while demonstrating superior convergence against standard black-box optimization methods and better estimation of the physical parameters.|Anoop Cherian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08027)|null|
|**2024-11-12**|**Language Models as Causal Effect Generators**|We present a framework for large language model (LLM) based data generation with controllable causal structure. In particular, we define a procedure for turning any language model and any directed acyclic graph (DAG) into a sequence-driven structural causal model (SD-SCM). Broadly speaking, an SD-SCM is a causal model with user-defined structure and LLM-defined structural equations. We characterize how an SD-SCM allows sampling from observational, interventional, and counterfactual distributions according to the desired causal structure. We then leverage this procedure to propose a new type of benchmark for causal inference methods, generating individual-level counterfactual data without needing to manually specify functional relationships between variables. We create an example benchmark consisting of thousands of datasets, and test a suite of popular estimation methods on these datasets for average, conditional average, and individual treatment effect estimation, both with and without hidden confounding. Apart from generating data, the same procedure also allows us to test for the presence of a causal effect that might be encoded in an LLM. This procedure can underpin auditing LLMs for misinformation, discrimination, or otherwise undesirable behavior. We believe SD-SCMs can serve as a useful tool in any application that would benefit from sequential data with controllable causal structure.|Lucius E. J.

This paper presents ExpressivityArena, a Python library for measuring the implicit communication abilities of LLMs. We provide a comprehensive framework to evaluate expressivity of arbitrary LLMs and explore its practical implications. To this end, we refine the definition and measurements of ``expressivity,'' and use our framework in a set of small experiments. These experiments test LLMs in creative and logical tasks such as poetry, coding, and emotion-based responses. They are then evaluated by an automated grader, through ExpressivityArena, which we verify to be the most pragmatic for testing expressivity. Building on these experiments, we deepen our understanding of the expressivity of LLMs by assessing their ability to remain expressive in conversations. Our findings indicate that LLMs are capable of generating and understanding expressive content, however, with some limitations. These insights will inform the future development and deployment of expressive LLMs. We provide the code for ExpressivityArena alongside our paper.|Joshua Tint et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08010)|null|

We investigate this attribution problem using formal language theory, specifically language identification in the limit as introduced by Gold and extended by Angluin. By modeling LLM outputs as formal languages, we analyze whether finite text samples can uniquely pinpoint the originating model. Our results show that due to the non-identifiability of certain language classes, under some mild assumptions about overlapping outputs from fine-tuned models it is theoretically impossible to attribute outputs to specific LLMs with certainty. This holds also when accounting for expressivity limitations of Transformer architectures. Even with direct model access or comprehensive monitoring, significant computational hurdles impede attribution efforts. These findings highlight an urgent need for proactive measures to mitigate risks posed by adversarial LLM use as their influence continues to expand.|Manuel Cebrian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08003)|null|
|**2024-11-12**|**Derivational Morphology Reveals Analogical Generalization in Large Language Models**|What mechanisms underlie linguistic generalization in large language models (LLMs)? This question has attracted considerable attention, with most studies analyzing the extent to which the language skills of LLMs resemble rules. As of yet, it is not known whether linguistic generalization in LLMs could equally well be explained as the result of analogical processes, which can be formalized as similarity operations on stored exemplars. A key shortcoming of prior research is its focus on linguistic phenomena with a high degree of regularity, for which rule-based and analogical approaches make the same predictions. Here, we instead examine derivational morphology, specifically English adjective nominalization, which displays notable variability. We introduce a new method for investigating linguistic generalization in LLMs: focusing on GPT-J, we fit cognitive models that instantiate rule-based and analogical learning to the LLM training data and compare their predictions on a set of nonce adjectives with those of the LLM, allowing us to draw direct conclusions regarding underlying mechanisms. As expected, rule-based and analogical models explain the predictions of GPT-J equally well for adjectives with regular nominalization patterns. However, for adjectives with variable nominalization patterns, the analogical model provides a much better match. Furthermore, GPT-J's behavior is sensitive to the individual word frequencies, even for regular forms, a behavior that is consistent with an analogical account of regular forms but not a rule-based one. These findings refute the hypothesis that GPT-J's linguistic generalization on adjective nominalization involves rules, suggesting similarity operations on stored exemplars as the underlying mechanism. Overall, our study suggests that analogical processes play a bigger role in the linguistic generalization of LLMs than previously thought.|Valentin Hofmann et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07990)|null|

Our key finding demonstrates that rectified flow can be straightforwardly trained within the large language model framework, eliminating the need for complex architectural modifications. To further improve the performance of our unified model, we adopt two key strategies: (i) decoupling the understanding and generation encoders, and (ii) aligning their representations during unified training. Extensive experiments show that JanusFlow achieves comparable or superior performance to specialized models in their respective domains, while significantly outperforming existing unified approaches across standard benchmarks.

However, existing benchmarks, such as HPD, which incorporates manually scored character relationships into the context for LLMs to sort coherence, and SocialBench, which uses specific profiles generated by LLMs in the context of multiple-choice tasks to assess character preferences, face limitations like poor generalizability, implicit and inaccurate judgments, and excessive context length. To address the above issues, we propose an automatic, scalable, and generalizable paradigm. Specifically, we construct a benchmark by extracting relations from a general knowledge graph and leverage RPA's inherent hallucination properties to prompt it to interact across roles, employing ChatGPT for stance detection and defining relationship hallucination along with three related metrics. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and stability of our metrics.

However, as server LLMs continue to scale in size, they will need to be distributed across more devices, magnifying the communication cost. One way to approach this problem is with quantization, but current methods for LLMs tend to avoid quantizing the features that tensor parallelism needs to communicate. Taking advantage of consistent outliers in communicated features, we introduce a quantization method that reduces communicated values on average from 16 bits to 4.2 bits while preserving nearly all of the original performance. For instance, our method maintains around 98.0% and 99.5% of Gemma 2 27B's and Llama 2 13B's original performance, respectively, averaged across all tasks we evaluated on.|Harry Dong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07942)|null|

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in solving mathematical problems, existing benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH present limitations, including narrow problem definitions with specific numbers and reliance on predetermined rules that hinder accurate assessments of reasoning and adaptability. This paper introduces the UTMath Benchmark, which robustly evaluates the models through extensive unit tests. It consists of 1,053 problems across 9 mathematical domains, with over 68 test cases per problem.We propose an innovative evaluation framework inspired by unit testing in software development, focusing on both accuracy and reliability of results. Furthermore, we introduce the Reasoning-to-Coding of Thoughts (RCoT) approach, which encourages LLMs to perform explicit reasoning before generating code, leading to generating more advanced solution and improved performance. Furthermore, we are releasing not only the UTMath benchmark but also the UTMath-Train training dataset (more than 70k samples), to support the community in further exploring mathematical reasoning.|Bo Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07240)|null|

|**2024-11-11**|**Tooling or Not Tooling? The Impact of Tools on Language Agents for Chemistry Problem Solving**|To enhance large language models (LLMs) for chemistry problem solving, several LLM-based agents augmented with tools have been proposed, such as ChemCrow and Coscientist. However, their evaluations are narrow in scope, leaving a large gap in understanding the benefits of tools across diverse chemistry tasks. To bridge this gap, we develop ChemAgent, an enhanced chemistry agent over ChemCrow, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its performance on both specialized chemistry tasks and general chemistry questions. Surprisingly, ChemAgent does not consistently outperform its base LLMs without tools. Our error analysis with a chemistry expert suggests that: For specialized chemistry tasks, such as synthesis prediction, we should augment agents with specialized tools; however, for general chemistry questions like those in exams, agents' ability to reason correctly with chemistry knowledge matters more, and tool augmentation does not always help.|Botao Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07228)|null|
|**2024-11-11**|**Comparing Bottom-Up and Top-Down Steering Approaches on In-Context Learning Tasks**|A key objective of interpretability research on large language models (LLMs) is to develop methods for robustly steering models toward desired behaviors. To this end, two distinct approaches to interpretability -- ``bottom-up" and ``top-down" -- have been presented, but there has been little quantitative comparison between them. We present a case study comparing the effectiveness of representative vector steering methods from each branch: function vectors (FV; arXiv:2310.15213), as a bottom-up method, and in-context vectors (ICV; arXiv:2311.06668) as a top-down method. While both aim to capture compact representations of broad in-context learning tasks, we find they are effective only on specific types of tasks: ICVs outperform FVs in behavioral shifting, whereas FVs excel in tasks requiring more precision. We discuss the implications for future evaluations of steering methods and for further research into top-down and bottom-up steering given these findings.|Madeline Brumley et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07213)|null|
|**2024-11-11**|**DLCR: A Generative Data Expansion Framework via Diffusion for Clothes-Changing Person Re-ID**|With the recent exhibited strength of generative diffusion models, an open research question is \textit{if images generated by these models can be used to learn better visual representations}. While this generative data expansion may suffice for easier visual tasks, we explore its efficacy on a more difficult discriminative task: clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID). CC-ReID aims to match people appearing in non-overlapping cameras, even when they change their clothes across cameras. Not only are current CC-ReID models constrained by the limited diversity of clothing in current CC-ReID datasets, but generating additional data that retains important personal features for accurate identification is a current challenge. To address this issue we propose DLCR, a novel data expansion framework that leverages pre-trained diffusion and large language models (LLMs) to accurately generate diverse images of individuals in varied attire. We generate additional data for five benchmark CC-ReID datasets (PRCC, CCVID, LaST, VC-Clothes, and LTCC) and \textbf{increase their clothing diversity by \boldmath{ $10$}x, totaling over \boldmath{$2.1$}M images generated}. DLCR employs diffusion-based text-guided inpainting, conditioned on clothing prompts constructed using LLMs, to generate synthetic data that only modifies a subject's clothes while preserving their personally identifiable features. With this massive increase in data, we introduce two novel strategies - progressive learning and test-time prediction refinement - that respectively reduce training time and further boosts CC-ReID performance. On the PRCC dataset, we obtain a large top-1 accuracy improvement of $11.3\%$ by training CAL, a previous state of the art (SOTA) method, with DLCR-generated data. We publicly release our code and generated data for each dataset here: \url{https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/dlcr}.|Nyle Siddiqui et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07205)|**[link](https://github.com/croitorualin/dlcr)**|
|**2024-11-11**|**The Super Weight in Large Language Models**|Recent works have shown a surprising result: a small fraction of Large Language Model (LLM) parameter outliers are disproportionately important to the quality of the model. LLMs contain billions of parameters, so these small fractions, such as 0.01%, translate to hundreds of thousands of parameters. In this work, we present an even more surprising finding: Pruning as few as a single parameter can destroy an LLM's ability to generate text -- increasing perplexity by 3 orders of magnitude and reducing zero-shot accuracy to guessing. We propose a data-free method for identifying such parameters, termed super weights, using a single forward pass through the model. We additionally find that these super weights induce correspondingly rare and large activation outliers, termed super activations. When preserved with high precision, super activations can improve simple round-to-nearest quantization to become competitive with state-of-the-art methods. For weight quantization, we similarly find that by preserving the super weight and clipping other weight outliers, round-to-nearest quantization can scale to much larger block sizes than previously considered. To facilitate further research into super weights, we provide an index of super weight coordinates for common, openly available LLMs.|Mengxia Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07191)|**[link](https://github.com/mengxiayu/llmsuperweight)**|

However, these capabilities have yet to be fully demonstrated in bioacoustics tasks, such as detecting animal vocalizations in large recordings, classifying rare and endangered species, and labeling context and behavior - tasks that are crucial for conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and the study of animal behavior. In this work, we present NatureLM-audio, the first audio-language foundation model specifically designed for bioacoustics. Our carefully curated training dataset comprises text-audio pairs spanning a diverse range of bioacoustics, speech, and music data, designed to address the challenges posed by limited annotated datasets in the field. We demonstrate successful transfer of learned representations from music and speech to bioacoustics, and our model shows promising generalization to unseen taxa and tasks. Importantly, we test NatureLM-audio on a novel benchmark (BEANS-Zero) and it sets the new state of the art (SotA) on several bioacoustics tasks, including zero-shot classification of unseen species. To advance bioacoustics research, we also open-source the code for generating training and benchmark data, as well as for training the model.|David Robinson et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07186)|null|
|**2024-11-11**|**Continual Memorization of Factoids in Large Language Models**|Large language models can absorb a massive amount of knowledge through pretraining, but pretraining is inefficient for acquiring long-tailed or specialized facts. Therefore, fine-tuning on specialized or new knowledge that reflects changes in the world has become popular, though it risks disrupting the model's original capabilities. We study this fragility in the context of continual memorization, where the model is trained on a small set of long-tail factoids (factual associations) and must retain these factoids after multiple stages of subsequent training on other datasets. Through extensive experiments, we show that LLMs suffer from forgetting across a wide range of subsequent tasks, and simple replay techniques do not fully prevent forgetting, especially when the factoid datasets are trained in the later stages. We posit that there are two ways to alleviate forgetting: 1) protect the memorization process as the model learns the factoids, or 2) reduce interference from training in later stages. With this insight, we develop an effective mitigation strategy: REMIX (Random and Generic Data Mixing). REMIX prevents forgetting by mixing generic data sampled from pretraining corpora or even randomly generated word sequences during each stage, despite being unrelated to the memorized factoids in the first stage. REMIX can recover performance from severe forgetting, often outperforming replay-based methods that have access to the factoids from the first stage. We then analyze how REMIX alters the learning process and find that successful forgetting prevention is associated with a pattern: the model stores factoids in earlier layers than usual and diversifies the set of layers that store these factoids. The efficacy of REMIX invites further investigation into the underlying dynamics of memorization and forgetting, opening exciting possibilities for future research.|Howard Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07175)|**[link](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/continual-factoid-memorization)**|

However, traditional frequency-based, data-driven neural network-based approaches can miss newly relevant content due to the evolving nature of language in a dynamically evolving environment. Human-curated symbolic knowledge sources, such as lexicons for standard language and slang terms, can potentially elevate social media signals in evolving language. We introduce a neurosymbolic method that integrates neural networks with symbolic knowledge sources, enhancing the detection and interpretation of mental health-related tweets relevant to COVID-19. Our method was evaluated using a corpus of large datasets (approximately 12 billion tweets, 2.5 million subreddit data, and 700k news articles) and multiple knowledge graphs. This method dynamically adapts to evolving language, outperforming purely data-driven models with an F1 score exceeding 92\%. This approach also showed faster adaptation to new data and lower computational demands than fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs). This study demonstrates the benefit of neurosymbolic methods in interpreting text in a dynamic environment for tasks such as health surveillance.|Vedant Khandelwal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07163)|null|

Specifically, first, we focus on the Chinese language over 6 major topics with 99 diverse subtopics. Second, we conduct a comprehensive quality control process to achieve high-quality questions and answers, where the reference answers are static and cannot be changed over time. Third, following SimpleQA, the questions and answers are very short, and the grading process is easy-to-evaluate based on OpenAI API. Based on Chinese SimpleQA, we perform a comprehensive evaluation on the factuality abilities of existing LLMs. Finally, we hope that Chinese SimpleQA could guide the developers to better understand the Chinese factuality abilities of their models and facilitate the growth of foundation models.|Yancheng He et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07140)|null|
|**2024-11-08**|**Recycled Attention: Efficient inference for long-context language models**|Generating long sequences of tokens given a long-context input imposes a heavy computational burden for large language models (LLMs). One of the computational bottleneck comes from computing attention over a long sequence of input at each generation step. In this paper, we propose Recycled Attention, an inference-time method which alternates between full context attention and attention over a subset of input tokens. When performing partial attention, we recycle the attention pattern of a previous token that has performed full attention and attend only to the top K most attended tokens, reducing the cost of data movement and attention computation. Compared to previously proposed inference-time acceleration method which attends only to local context or tokens with high accumulative attention scores, our approach flexibly chooses tokens that are relevant to the current decoding step. We evaluate our methods on RULER, a suite of tasks designed to comprehensively evaluate long-context abilities, and long-context language modeling tasks. Applying our method to off-the-shelf LLMs achieves comparable speedup to baselines which only consider local context while improving the performance by 2x. We further explore two ideas to improve performance-efficiency trade-offs: (1) dynamically decide when to perform recycled or full attention step based on the query similarities and (2) continued pre-training the model with Recycled Attention.|Fangyuan Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05787)|null|

The task of lexical selection requires using context to identify which variation is most appropriate for a source text. We work with native speakers of nine languages to create DTAiLS, a dataset of 1,377 sentence pairs that exhibit cross-lingual concept variation when translating from English. We evaluate recent LLMs and neural machine translation systems on DTAiLS, with the best-performing model, GPT-4, achieving from 67 to 85% accuracy across languages. Finally, we use language models to generate English rules describing target-language concept variations. Providing weaker models with high-quality lexical rules improves accuracy substantially, in some cases reaching or outperforming GPT-4.|Josh Barua et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05781)|null|
|**2024-11-08**|**LLMs as Method Actors: A Model for Prompt Engineering and Architecture**|We introduce "Method Actors" as a mental model for guiding LLM prompt engineering and prompt architecture. Under this mental model, LLMs should be thought of as actors; prompts as scripts and cues; and LLM responses as performances. We apply this mental model to the task of improving LLM performance at playing Connections, a New York Times word puzzle game that prior research identified as a challenging benchmark for evaluating LLM reasoning. Our experiments with GPT-4o show that a "Method Actors" approach can significantly improve LLM performance over both a vanilla and "Chain of Thoughts" approach. A vanilla approach solves 27% of Connections puzzles in our dataset and a "Chain of Thoughts" approach solves 41% of puzzles, whereas our strongest "Method Actor" approach solves 86% of puzzles. We also test OpenAI's newest model designed specifically for complex reasoning tasks, o1-preview. When asked to solve a puzzle all at once, o1-preview solves 79% of Connections puzzles in our dataset, and when allowed to build puzzle solutions one guess at a time over multiple API calls, o1-preview solves 100% of the puzzles. Incorporating a "Method Actor" prompt architecture increases the percentage of puzzles that o1-preview solves perfectly from 76% to 87%.|Colin Doyle et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05778)|null|
|**2024-11-08**|**Quantitative Assessment of Intersectional Empathetic Bias and Understanding**|A growing amount of literature critiques the current operationalizations of empathy based on loose definitions of the construct. Such definitions negatively affect dataset quality, model robustness, and evaluation reliability. We propose an empathy evaluation framework that operationalizes empathy close to its psychological origins. The framework measures the variance in responses of LLMs to prompts using existing metrics for empathy and emotional valence. The variance is introduced through the controlled generation of the prompts by varying social biases affecting context understanding, thus impacting empathetic understanding. The control over generation ensures high theoretical validity of the constructs in the prompt dataset. Also, it makes high-quality translation, especially into languages that currently have little-to-no way of evaluating empathy or bias, such as the Slavonic family, more manageable. Using chosen LLMs and various prompt types, we demonstrate the empathy evaluation with the framework, including multiple-choice answers and free generation. The variance in our initial evaluation sample is small and we were unable to measure convincing differences between the empathetic understanding in contexts given by different social groups. However, the results are promising because the models showed significant alterations their reasoning chains needed to capture the relatively subtle changes in the prompts. This provides the basis for future research into the construction of the evaluation sample and statistical methods for measuring the results.|Vojtech Formanek et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05777)|null|

Manual fact-checking methods face issues of scalability and annotator bias, while machine learning models require large, costly labelled datasets. This study investigates the use of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) as reliable annotators for detecting political factuality in news articles. Using open-source LLMs, we create a politically diverse dataset, labelled for bias through LLM-generated annotations. These annotations are validated by human experts and further evaluated by LLM-based judges to assess the accuracy and reliability of the annotations.

FinDVer contains 2,400 expert-annotated examples, divided into three subsets: information extraction, numerical reasoning, and knowledge-intensive reasoning, each addressing common scenarios encountered in real-world financial contexts. We assess a broad spectrum of LLMs under long-context and RAG settings. Our results show that even the current best-performing system, GPT-4o, still lags behind human experts. We further provide in-depth analysis on long-context and RAG setting, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, and model reasoning errors, offering insights to drive future advancements.

|**2024-11-08**|**Multi-hop Evidence Pursuit Meets the Web: Team Papelo at FEVER 2024**|Separating disinformation from fact on the web has long challenged both the search and the reasoning powers of humans. We show that the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) and the retrieval power of modern search engines can be combined to automate this process and explainably verify claims. We integrate LLMs and search under a multi-hop evidence pursuit strategy. This strategy generates an initial question based on an input claim using a sequence to sequence model, searches and formulates an answer to the question, and iteratively generates follow-up questions to pursue the evidence that is missing using an LLM. We demonstrate our system on the FEVER 2024 (AVeriTeC) shared task. Compared to a strategy of generating all the questions at once, our method obtains .045 higher label accuracy and .155 higher AVeriTeC score (evaluating the adequacy of the evidence). Through ablations, we show the importance of various design choices, such as the question generation method, medium-sized context, reasoning with one document at a time, adding metadata, paraphrasing, reducing the problem to two classes, and reconsidering the final verdict. Our submitted system achieves .510 AVeriTeC score on the dev set and .477 AVeriTeC score on the test set.|Christopher Malon et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05762)|null|
|**2024-11-08**|**Tell What You Hear From What You See -- Video to Audio Generation Through Text**|The content of visual and audio scenes is multi-faceted such that a video can be paired with various audio and vice-versa. Thereby, in video-to-audio generation task, it is imperative to introduce steering approaches for controlling the generated audio. While Video-to-Audio generation is a well-established generative task, existing methods lack such controllability. In this work, we propose VATT, a multi-modal generative framework that takes a video and an optional text prompt as input, and generates audio and optional textual description of the audio. Such a framework has two advantages: i) Video-to-Audio generation process can be refined and controlled via text which complements the context of visual information, and ii) The model can suggest what audio to generate for the video by generating audio captions. VATT consists of two key modules: VATT Converter, a LLM that is fine-tuned for instructions and includes a projection layer that maps video features to the LLM vector space; and VATT Audio, a transformer that generates audio tokens from visual frames and from optional text prompt using iterative parallel decoding. The audio tokens are converted to a waveform by pretrained neural codec. Experiments show that when VATT is compared to existing video-to-audio generation methods in objective metrics, it achieves competitive performance when the audio caption is not provided. When the audio caption is provided as a prompt, VATT achieves even more refined performance (lowest KLD score of 1.41). Furthermore, subjective studies show that VATT Audio has been chosen as preferred generated audio than audio generated by existing methods. VATT enables controllable video-to-audio generation through text as well as suggesting text prompts for videos through audio captions, unlocking novel applications such as text-guided video-to-audio generation and video-to-audio captioning.|Xiulong Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05679)|null|

We introduce two novel tasks: MskQA, measuring reasoning on masked question-answering datasets like RealtimeQA, and MskCal, assessing numerical reasoning on masked arithmetic problems.Testing GPT-4o and 4o-mini reveals that while LLMs exhibit some resilience to masked text, their performance is highly contingent on masking rates and semantic cues. Specifically, "solid masking," where semantic clues are entirely absent, leads to a significant performance drop compared to "partial lifting," where some semantic information is retained, indicating LLMs' reliance on surface-level patterns. Interestingly, GPT-4o consistently outperforms 4o-mini, particularly in MskCal, demonstrating a greater ability to handle numerical reasoning with masked text. This underscores the crucial role of semantic cues in the reasoning process of LLMs. Our study illuminates the interplay between background knowledge and reasoning ability in masked text processing, paving the way for a deeper understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations, and highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods to accurately assess their true comprehension abilities.|Fuka Matsuzaki et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05665)|**[link](https://github.com/isfhub/maskcode)**|
|**2024-11-08**|**The influence of persona and conversational task on social interactions with a LLM-controlled embodied conversational agent**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in conversational tasks. Embodying an LLM as a virtual human allows users to engage in face-to-face social interactions in Virtual Reality. However, the influence of person- and task-related factors in social interactions with LLM-controlled agents remains unclear. In this study, forty-six participants interacted with a virtual agent whose persona was manipulated as extravert or introvert in three different conversational tasks (small talk, knowledge test, convincing). Social-evaluation, emotional experience, and realism were assessed using ratings. Interactive engagement was measured by quantifying participants' words and conversational turns. Finally, we measured participants' willingness to ask the agent for help during the knowledge test. Our findings show that the extraverted agent was more positively evaluated, elicited a more pleasant experience and greater engagement, and was assessed as more realistic compared to the introverted agent. Whereas persona did not affect the tendency to ask for help, participants were generally more confident in the answer when they had help of the LLM. Variation of personality traits of LLM-controlled embodied virtual agents, therefore, affects social-emotional processing and behavior in virtual interactions. Embodied virtual agents allow the presentation of naturalistic social encounters in a virtual environment.|Leon O. H. Kroczek et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05653)|null|
|**2024-11-07**|**SVDQunat: Absorbing Outliers by Low-Rank Components for 4-Bit Diffusion Models**|Diffusion models have been proven highly effective at generating high-quality images. However, as these models grow larger, they require significantly more memory and suffer from higher latency, posing substantial challenges for deployment. In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing their weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both weights and activations are highly sensitive, where conventional post-training quantization methods for large language models like smoothing become insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit quantization paradigm. Different from smoothing which redistributes outliers between weights and activations, our approach absorbs these outliers using a low-rank branch. We first consolidate the outliers by shifting them from activations to weights, then employ a high-precision low-rank branch to take in the weight outliers with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This process eases the quantization on both sides. However, na\"{\i}vely running the low-rank branch independently incurs significant overhead due to extra data movement of activations, negating the quantization speedup. To address this, we co-design an inference engine Nunchaku that fuses the kernels of the low-rank branch into those of the low-bit branch to cut off redundant memory access. It can also seamlessly support off-the-shelf low-rank adapters (LoRAs) without the need for re-quantization. Extensive experiments on SDXL, PixArt- $\Sigma$, and FLUX.1 validate the effectiveness of SVDQuant in preserving image quality. We reduce the memory usage for the 12B FLUX.1 models by 3.5$\times$, achieving 3.0$\times$ speedup over the 4-bit weight-only quantized baseline on the 16GB laptop 4090 GPU, paving the way for more interactive applications on PCs.

|**2024-11-07**|**Needle Threading: Can LLMs Follow Threads through Near-Million-Scale Haystacks?**|As the context limits of Large Language Models (LLMs) increase, the range of possible applications and downstream functions broadens. In many real-world tasks, decisions depend on details scattered across collections of often disparate documents containing mostly irrelevant information. Long-context LLMs appear well-suited to this form of complex information retrieval and reasoning, which has traditionally proven costly and time-consuming. However, although the development of longer context models has seen rapid gains in recent years, our understanding of how effectively LLMs use their context has not kept pace. To address this, we conduct a set of retrieval experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities of 17 leading LLMs, such as their ability to follow threads of information through the context window. Strikingly, we find that many models are remarkably threadsafe: capable of simultaneously following multiple threads without significant loss in performance. Still, for many models, we find the effective context limit is significantly shorter than the supported context length, with accuracy decreasing as the context window grows. Our study also highlights the important point that token counts from different tokenizers should not be directly compared -- they often correspond to substantially different numbers of written characters. We release our code and long-context experimental data.|Jonathan Roberts et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05000)|null|

However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system's applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot's own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot's environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models. Powered by DynaMem, our robots can explore novel environments, search for objects not found in memory, and continuously update the memory as objects move, appear, or disappear in the scene. We run extensive experiments on the Stretch SE3 robots in three real and nine offline scenes, and achieve an average pick-and-drop success rate of 70% on non-stationary objects, which is more than a 2x improvement over state-of-the-art static systems.

|**2024-11-07**|**LLM2CLIP: Powerful Language Model Unlock Richer Visual Representation**|CLIP is one of the most important multimodal foundational models today. What powers CLIP's capabilities? The rich supervision signals provided by natural language, the carrier of human knowledge, shape a powerful cross-modal representation space. However, with the rapid advancements in large language models LLMs like GPT-4 and LLaMA, the boundaries of language comprehension and generation are continually being pushed. This raises an intriguing question: can the capabilities of LLMs be harnessed to further improve multimodal representation learning? The potential benefits of incorporating LLMs into CLIP are clear. LLMs' strong textual understanding can fundamentally improve CLIP's ability to handle image captions, drastically enhancing its ability to process long and complex texts, a well-known limitation of vanilla CLIP. Moreover, LLMs are trained on a vast corpus of text, possessing open-world knowledge. This allows them to expand on caption information during training, increasing the efficiency of the learning process. In this paper, we propose LLM2CLIP, a novel approach that embraces the power of LLMs to unlock CLIP's potential. By fine-tuning the LLM in the caption space with contrastive learning, we extract its textual capabilities into the output embeddings, significantly improving the output layer's textual discriminability. We then design an efficient training process where the fine-tuned LLM acts as a powerful teacher for CLIP's visual encoder. Thanks to the LLM's presence, we can now incorporate longer and more complex captions without being restricted by vanilla CLIP's text encoder's context window and ability limitations. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach brings substantial improvements in cross-modal tasks.|Weiquan Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04997)|**[link](https://github.com/microsoft/LLM2CLIP)**|

Training these models demands significantly larger datasets and computational resources compared to text-only LLMs. To address the scaling challenges, we introduce Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a sparse multi-modal transformer architecture that significantly reduces pretraining computational costs. MoT decouples non-embedding parameters of the model by modality -- including feed-forward networks, attention matrices, and layer normalization -- enabling modality-specific processing with global self-attention over the full input sequence. We evaluate MoT across multiple settings and model scales. In the Chameleon 7B setting (autoregressive text-and-image generation), MoT matches the dense baseline's performance using only 55.8\% of the FLOPs. When extended to include speech, MoT reaches speech performance comparable to the dense baseline with only 37.2\% of the FLOPs. In the Transfusion setting, where text and image are trained with different objectives, a 7B MoT model matches the image modality performance of the dense baseline with one third of the FLOPs, and a 760M MoT model outperforms a 1.4B dense baseline across key image generation metrics. System profiling further highlights MoT's practical benefits, achieving dense baseline image quality in 47.2\% of the wall-clock time and text quality in 75.6\% of the wall-clock time (measured on AWS p4de.24xlarge instances with NVIDIA A100 GPUs).|Weixin Liang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04996)|null|
|**2024-11-07**|**Rethinking Bradley-Terry Models in Preference-Based Reward Modeling: Foundations, Theory, and Alternatives**|The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is a common and successful practice in reward modeling for Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. However, it remains unclear why this model -- originally developed for multi-player stochastic game matching -- can be adopted to convert pairwise response comparisons to reward values and make predictions. Especially given the fact that only a limited number of prompt-response pairs are sparsely compared with others. In this paper, we first revisit the foundations of using BT models in reward modeling, and establish the convergence rate of BT reward models based on deep neural networks using embeddings, providing a theoretical foundation for their use. Despite theoretically sound, we argue that the BT model is not a necessary choice from the perspective of downstream optimization. This is because a reward model only needs to preserve the correct ranking predictions through a monotonic transformation of the true reward. We highlight the critical concept of order consistency in reward modeling and demonstrate that the BT model possesses this property. Consequently, we propose a simple and straightforward upper-bound algorithm, compatible with off-the-shelf binary classifiers, as an alternative order-consistent reward modeling objective. To offer practical insights, we empirically evaluate the performance of these different reward modeling approaches across more than 12,000 experimental setups, using $6$ base LLMs, $2$ datasets, and diverse annotation designs that vary in quantity, quality, and pairing choices in preference annotations.|Hao Sun et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04991)|**[link](https://github.com/holarissun/rewardmodelingbeyondbradleyterry)**|
|**2024-11-07**|**Enhancing Reverse Engineering: Investigating and Benchmarking Large Language Models for Vulnerability Analysis in Decompiled Binaries**|Security experts reverse engineer (decompile) binary code to identify critical security vulnerabilities. The limited access to source code in vital systems - such as firmware, drivers, and proprietary software used in Critical Infrastructures (CI) - makes this analysis even more crucial on the binary level. Even with available source code, a semantic gap persists after compilation between the source and the binary code executed by the processor. This gap may hinder the detection of vulnerabilities in source code. That being said, current research on Large Language Models (LLMs) overlooks the significance of decompiled binaries in this area by focusing solely on source code. In this work, we are the first to empirically uncover the substantial semantic limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs when it comes to analyzing vulnerabilities in decompiled binaries, largely due to the absence of relevant datasets. To bridge the gap, we introduce DeBinVul, a novel decompiled binary code vulnerability dataset. Our dataset is multi-architecture and multi-optimization, focusing on C/C++ due to their wide usage in CI and association with numerous vulnerabilities. Specifically, we curate 150,872 samples of vulnerable and non-vulnerable decompiled binary code for the task of (i) identifying; (ii) classifying; (iii) describing vulnerabilities; and (iv) recovering function names in the domain of decompiled binaries. Subsequently, we fine-tune state-of-the-art LLMs using DeBinVul and report on a performance increase of 19%, 24%, and 21% in the capabilities of CodeLlama, Llama3, and CodeGen2 respectively, in detecting binary code vulnerabilities. Additionally, using DeBinVul, we report a high performance of 80-90% on the vulnerability classification task. Furthermore, we report improved performance in function name recovery and vulnerability description tasks.|Dylan Manuel et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04981)|null|
|**2024-11-07**|**SuffixDecoding: A Model-Free Approach to Speeding Up Large Language Model Inference**|We present SuffixDecoding, a novel model-free approach to accelerating large language model (LLM) inference through speculative decoding. Unlike existing methods that rely on draft models or specialized decoding heads, SuffixDecoding leverages suffix trees built from previously generated outputs to efficiently predict candidate token sequences. Our approach enables flexible tree-structured speculation without the overhead of maintaining and orchestrating additional models. SuffixDecoding builds and dynamically updates suffix trees to capture patterns in the generated text, using them to construct speculation trees through a principled scoring mechanism based on empirical token frequencies. SuffixDecoding requires only CPU memory which is plentiful and underutilized on typical LLM serving nodes. We demonstrate that SuffixDecoding achieves competitive speedups compared to model-based approaches across diverse workloads including open-domain chat, code generation, and text-to-SQL tasks. For open-ended chat and code generation tasks, SuffixDecoding achieves up to $1.4\times$ higher output throughput than SpecInfer and up to $1.1\times$ lower time-per-token (TPOT) latency. For a proprietary multi-LLM text-to-SQL application, SuffixDecoding achieves up to $2.9\times$ higher output throughput and $3\times$ lower latency than speculative decoding. Our evaluation shows that SuffixDecoding maintains high acceptance rates even with small reference corpora of 256 examples, while continuing to improve performance as more historical outputs are incorporated.|Gabriele Oliaro et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04975)|null|

In this work, we introduce BitNet a4.8, enabling 4-bit activations for 1-bit LLMs. BitNet a4.8 employs a hybrid quantization and sparsification strategy to mitigate the quantization errors introduced by the outlier channels. Specifically, we utilize 4-bit activations for inputs to the attention and feed-forward network layers, while sparsifying intermediate states followed with 8-bit quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BitNet a4.8 achieves performance comparable to BitNet b1.58 with equivalent training costs, while being faster in inference with enabling 4-bit (INT4/FP4) kernels. Additionally, BitNet a4.8 activates only 55% of parameters and supports 3-bit KV cache, further enhancing the efficiency of large-scale LLM deployment and inference.|Hongyu Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04965)|null|

|**2024-11-06**|**Medical Adaptation of Large Language and Vision-Language Models: Are We Making Progress?**|Several recent works seek to develop foundation models specifically for medical applications, adapting general-purpose large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) via continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) improves performance on downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical licensing exam questions. In this paper, we compare seven public "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting regime for medical question-answering (QA) tasks. For instance, across the tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs only outperform their base models in 12.1% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 49.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in the remaining 38.2% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model head-to-head, directly against the corresponding base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. While these basic practices are not consistently adopted in the literature, our ablations show that they substantially impact conclusions. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.|Daniel P.

Motivated by this, we investigate the internal mechanisms that underpin a network's ability to perform complex logical reasoning. We first construct a synthetic propositional logic problem that serves as a concrete test-bed for network training and evaluation. Crucially, this problem demands nontrivial planning to solve, but we can train a small transformer to achieve perfect accuracy. Building on our set-up, we then pursue an understanding of precisely how a three-layer transformer, trained from scratch, solves this problem. We are able to identify certain "planning" and "reasoning" circuits in the network that necessitate cooperation between the attention blocks to implement the desired logic. To expand our findings, we then study a larger model, Mistral 7B. Using activation patching, we characterize internal components that are critical in solving our logic problem. Overall, our work systemically uncovers novel aspects of small and large transformers, and continues the study of how they plan and reason.|Guan Zhe Hong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04105)|null|
|**2024-11-06**|**Textual Decomposition Then Sub-motion-space Scattering for Open-Vocabulary Motion Generation**|Text-to-motion generation is a crucial task in computer vision, which generates the target 3D motion by the given text. The existing annotated datasets are limited in scale, resulting in most existing methods overfitting to the small datasets and unable to generalize to the motions of the open domain. Some methods attempt to solve the open-vocabulary motion generation problem by aligning to the CLIP space or using the Pretrain-then-Finetuning paradigm. However, the current annotated dataset's limited scale only allows them to achieve mapping from sub-text-space to sub-motion-space, instead of mapping between full-text-space and full-motion-space (full mapping), which is the key to attaining open-vocabulary motion generation. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage the atomic motion (simple body part motions over a short time period) as an intermediate representation, and leverage two orderly coupled steps, i.e., Textual Decomposition and Sub-motion-space Scattering, to address the full mapping problem. For Textual Decomposition, we design a fine-grained description conversion algorithm, and combine it with the generalization ability of a large language model to convert any given motion text into atomic texts. Sub-motion-space Scattering learns the compositional process from atomic motions to the target motions, to make the learned sub-motion-space scattered to form the full-motion-space. For a given motion of the open domain, it transforms the extrapolation into interpolation and thereby significantly improves generalization. Our network, $DSO$-Net, combines textual $d$ecomposition and sub-motion-space $s$cattering to solve the $o$ pen-vocabulary motion generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DSO-Net achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary motion generation.

|**2024-11-06**|**Beemo: Benchmark of Expert-edited Machine-generated Outputs**|The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has increased the volume of machine-generated texts (MGTs) and blurred text authorship in various domains. However, most existing MGT benchmarks include single-author texts (human-written and machine-generated). This conventional design fails to capture more practical multi-author scenarios, where the user refines the LLM response for natural flow, coherence, and factual correctness. Our paper introduces the Benchmark of Expert-edited Machine-generated Outputs (Beemo), which includes 6.5k texts written by humans, generated by ten instruction-finetuned LLMs, and edited by experts for various use cases, ranging from creative writing to summarization. Beemo additionally comprises 13.1k machine-generated and LLM-edited texts, allowing for diverse MGT detection evaluation across various edit types. We document Beemo's creation protocol and present the results of benchmarking 33 configurations of MGT detectors in different experimental setups. We find that expert-based editing evades MGT detection, while LLM-edited texts are unlikely to be recognized as human-written.

In multilingual societies like India, particularly among the youth engaging on social media, text often exhibits code-mixing, blending local languages with English at different linguistic levels. This phenomenon presents formidable challenges for LI systems, especially when languages intermingle within single words. Dravidian languages, prevalent in southern India, possess rich morphological structures yet suffer from under-representation in digital platforms, leading to the adoption of Roman or hybrid scripts for communication. This paper introduces a prompt based method for a shared task aimed at addressing word-level LI challenges in Dravidian languages. In this work, we leveraged GPT-3.5 Turbo to understand whether the large language models is able to correctly classify words into correct categories. Our findings show that the Kannada model consistently outperformed the Tamil model across most metrics, indicating a higher accuracy and reliability in identifying and categorizing Kannada language instances. In contrast, the Tamil model showed moderate performance, particularly needing improvement in precision and recall.|Aniket Deroy et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04025)|null|

Deep multiple clustering methods have achieved remarkable performance by exploiting complex patterns and relationships in data. However, existing works struggle to flexibly adapt to diverse user-specific needs in data grouping, which may require manual understanding of each clustering. To address these limitations, we introduce Multi-Sub, a novel end-to-end multiple clustering approach that incorporates a multi-modal subspace proxy learning framework in this work. Utilizing the synergistic capabilities of CLIP and GPT-4, Multi-Sub aligns textual prompts expressing user preferences with their corresponding visual representations. This is achieved by automatically generating proxy words from large language models that act as subspace bases, thus allowing for the customized representation of data in terms specific to the user's interests. Our method consistently outperforms existing baselines across a broad set of datasets in visual multiple clustering tasks.

|**2024-11-06**|**What Really is Commonsense Knowledge?**|Commonsense datasets have been well developed in Natural Language Processing, mainly through crowdsource human annotation. However, there are debates on the genuineness of commonsense reasoning benchmarks. In specific, a significant portion of instances in some commonsense benchmarks do not concern commonsense knowledge. That problem would undermine the measurement of the true commonsense reasoning ability of evaluated models. It is also suggested that the problem originated from a blurry concept of commonsense knowledge, as distinguished from other types of knowledge. To demystify all of the above claims, in this study, we survey existing definitions of commonsense knowledge, ground into the three frameworks for defining concepts, and consolidate them into a multi-framework unified definition of commonsense knowledge (so-called consolidated definition). We then use the consolidated definition for annotations and experiments on the CommonsenseQA and CommonsenseQA 2.0 datasets to examine the above claims. Our study shows that there exists a large portion of non-commonsense-knowledge instances in the two datasets, and a large performance gap on these two subsets where Large Language Models (LLMs) perform worse on commonsense-knowledge instances.|Quyet V.

|**2024-11-06**|**How Does A Text Preprocessing Pipeline Affect Ontology Syntactic Matching?**|The generic text preprocessing pipeline, comprising Tokenisation, Normalisation, Stop Words Removal, and Stemming/Lemmatisation, has been implemented in many ontology matching (OM) systems. However, the lack of standardisation in text preprocessing creates diversity in mapping results. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the text preprocessing pipeline on OM tasks at syntactic levels. Our experiments on 8 Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) track repositories with 49 distinct alignments indicate: (1) Tokenisation and Normalisation are currently more effective than Stop Words Removal and Stemming/Lemmatisation; and (2) The selection of Lemmatisation and Stemming is task-specific. We recommend standalone Lemmatisation or Stemming with post-hoc corrections. We find that (3) Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer perform better than Lancaster Stemmer; and that (4) Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging does not help Lemmatisation. To repair less effective Stop Words Removal and Stemming/Lemmatisation used in OM tasks, we propose a novel context-based pipeline repair approach that significantly improves matching correctness and overall matching performance. We also discuss the use of text preprocessing pipeline in the new era of large language models (LLMs).|Zhangcheng Qiang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03962)|null|
|**2024-11-06**|**Fine-Grained Guidance for Retrievers: Leveraging LLMs' Feedback in Retrieval-Augmented Generation**|Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven to be an effective method for mitigating hallucination issues inherent in large language models (LLMs). Previous approaches typically train retrievers based on semantic similarity, lacking optimization for RAG. More recent works have proposed aligning retrievers with the preference signals of LLMs. However, these preference signals are often difficult for dense retrievers, which typically have weaker language capabilities, to understand and learn effectively. Drawing inspiration from pedagogical theories like Guided Discovery Learning, we propose a novel framework, FiGRet (Fine-grained Guidance for Retrievers), which leverages the language capabilities of LLMs to construct examples from a more granular, information-centric perspective to guide the learning of retrievers. Specifically, our method utilizes LLMs to construct easy-to-understand examples from samples where the retriever performs poorly, focusing on three learning objectives highly relevant to the RAG scenario: relevance, comprehensiveness, and purity. These examples serve as scaffolding to ultimately align the retriever with the LLM's preferences. Furthermore, we employ a dual curriculum learning strategy and leverage the reciprocal feedback between LLM and retriever to further enhance the performance of the RAG system. A series of experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework enhances the performance of RAG systems equipped with different retrievers and is applicable to various LLMs.|Yuhang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03957)|null|

We introduce Babel Bardo, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform speech transcriptions into music descriptions for controlling a text-to-music model. Four versions of Babel Bardo were compared in two TRPG campaigns: a baseline using direct speech transcriptions, and three LLM-based versions with varying approaches to music description generation. Evaluations considered audio quality, story alignment, and transition smoothness. Results indicate that detailed music descriptions improve audio quality while maintaining consistency across consecutive descriptions enhances story alignment and transition smoothness.|Felipe Marra et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03948)|null|
|**2024-11-05**|**Inference Optimal VLMs Need Only One Visual Token but Larger Models**|Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various visual understanding and reasoning tasks. However, their real-world deployment is often constrained by high latency during inference due to substantial compute required to process the large number of input tokens (predominantly from the image) by the LLM. To reduce inference costs, one can either downsize the LLM or reduce the number of input image-tokens, the latter of which has been the focus of many recent works around token compression. However, it is unclear what the optimal trade-off is, as both the factors directly affect the VLM performance. We first characterize this optimal trade-off between the number of visual tokens and LLM parameters by establishing scaling laws that capture variations in performance with these two factors. Our results reveal a surprising trend: for visual reasoning tasks, the inference-optimal behavior in VLMs, i.e., minimum downstream error at any given fixed inference compute, is achieved when using the largest LLM that fits within the inference budget while minimizing visual token count - often to a single token. While the token reduction literature has mainly focused on maintaining base model performance by modestly reducing the token count (e.g., $5-10\times$ ), our results indicate that the compute-optimal inference regime requires operating under even higher token compression ratios. Based on these insights, we take some initial steps towards building approaches tailored for high token compression settings.

We perform a detailed evaluation of two important techniques: In-Context Learning (ICL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), showing how they can improve detection. SFT increases performance by using domain-specific data, whereas ICL helps the detection model to quickly adapt to new threats without requiring much retraining. We use Meta's Llama3 8B model, on a custom dataset with 68 malware families and normal domains, covering several hard-to-detect schemes, including recent word-based DGAs. Results proved that LLM-based methods can achieve competitive results in DGA detection. In particular, the SFT-based LLM DGA detector outperforms state-of-the-art models using attention layers, achieving 94% accuracy with a 4% false positive rate (FPR) and excelling at detecting word-based DGA domains.|Reynier Leyva La O et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03307)|null|
|**2024-11-05**|**VERITAS: A Unified Approach to Reliability Evaluation**|Large language models (LLMs) often fail to synthesize information from their context to generate an accurate response. This renders them unreliable in knowledge intensive settings where reliability of the output is key. A critical component for reliable LLMs is the integration of a robust fact-checking system that can detect hallucinations across various formats. While several open-access fact-checking models are available, their functionality is often limited to specific tasks, such as grounded question-answering or entailment verification, and they perform less effectively in conversational settings. On the other hand, closed-access models like GPT-4 and Claude offer greater flexibility across different contexts, including grounded dialogue verification, but are hindered by high costs and latency. In this work, we introduce VERITAS, a family of hallucination detection models designed to operate flexibly across diverse contexts while minimizing latency and costs. VERITAS achieves state-of-the-art results considering average performance on all major hallucination detection benchmarks, with $10\%$ increase in average performance when compared to similar-sized models and get close to the performance of GPT4 turbo with LLM-as-a-judge setting.|Rajkumar Ramamurthy et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03300)|null|

Through controlled experiments with 600 participants from India and the US, who reviewed and wrote constructive comments on online threads on Islamophobia and homophobia, we found potential misalignment in how LLMs and humans perceive constructiveness in online comments. While the LLM was more likely to view dialectical comments as more constructive, participants favored comments that emphasized logic and facts more than the LLM did. Despite these differences, participants rated LLM-generated and human-AI co-written comments as significantly more constructive than those written independently by humans. Our analysis also revealed that LLM-generated and human-AI co-written comments exhibited more linguistic features associated with constructiveness compared to human-written comments on divisive topics. When participants used LLMs to refine their comments, the resulting comments were longer, more polite, positive, less toxic, and more readable, with added argumentative features that retained the original intent but occasionally lost nuances. Based on these findings, we discuss ethical and design considerations in using LLMs to facilitate constructive discourse online.|Farhana Shahid et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03295)|null|

To automate this design-to-code transformation process, various automated methods using learning-based networks and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have been proposed. However, these studies were merely evaluated on a narrow range of static web pages and ignored dynamic interaction elements, making them less practical for real-world website deployment.   To fill in the blank, we present the first systematic investigation of MLLMs in generating interactive webpages. Specifically, we first formulate the Interaction-to-Code task and build the Interaction2Code benchmark that contains 97 unique web pages and 213 distinct interactions, spanning 15 webpage types and 30 interaction categories. We then conduct comprehensive experiments on three state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs using both automatic metrics and human evaluations, thereby summarizing six findings accordingly. Our experimental results highlight the limitations of MLLMs in generating fine-grained interactive features and managing interactions with complex transformations and subtle visual modifications. We further analyze failure cases and their underlying causes, identifying 10 common failure types and assessing their severity. Additionally, our findings reveal three critical influencing factors, i.e., prompts, visual saliency, and textual descriptions, that can enhance the interaction generation performance of MLLMs. Based on these findings, we elicit implications for researchers and developers, providing a foundation for future advancements in this field.

To address these challenges, we draw inspiration from the sparse mixture-of-agents (SMoE) and propose a sparse mixture-of-agents (SMoA) framework to improve the efficiency and diversity of multi-agent LLMs. Unlike completely connected structures, SMoA introduces novel Response Selection and Early Stopping mechanisms to sparsify information flows among individual LLM agents, striking a balance between performance and efficiency. Additionally, inspired by the expert diversity principle in SMoE frameworks for workload balance between experts, we assign distinct role descriptions to each LLM agent, fostering diverse and divergent thinking. Extensive experiments on reasoning, alignment, and fairness benchmarks demonstrate that SMoA achieves performance comparable to traditional mixture-of-agents approaches but with significantly lower computational costs. Further analysis reveals that SMoA is more stable, has a greater capacity to scale, and offers considerable potential through hyper-parameter optimization.

In previous studies of LLM-based agents, each agent's characteristics, including personality and memory, have traditionally been predefined. We focused on how individuality, such as behavior, personality, and memory, can be differentiated from an undifferentiated state. The present LLM agents engage in cooperative communication within a group simulation, exchanging context-based messages in natural language. By analyzing this multi-agent simulation, we report valuable new insights into how social norms, cooperation, and personality traits can emerge spontaneously. This paper demonstrates that autonomously interacting LLM-powered agents generate hallucinations and hashtags to sustain communication, which, in turn, increases the diversity of words within their interactions. Each agent's emotions shift through communication, and as they form communities, the personalities of the agents emerge and evolve accordingly.

However, synthetic data generation via prompting LLMs remains challenging due to LLMs' limited understanding of target data distributions and the complexity of prompt engineering, especially for structured formatted data. To address these issues, we introduce DiffLM, a controllable data synthesis framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE), which further (1) leverages diffusion models to reserve more information of original distribution and format structure in the learned latent distribution and (2) decouples the learning of target distribution knowledge from the LLM's generative objectives via a plug-and-play latent feature injection module. As we observed significant discrepancies between the VAE's latent representations and the real data distribution, the latent diffusion module is introduced into our framework to learn a fully expressive latent distribution. Evaluations on seven real-world datasets with structured formatted data (i.e., Tabular, Code and Tool data) demonstrate that DiffLM generates high-quality data, with performance on downstream tasks surpassing that of real data by 2-7 percent in certain cases. The data and code will be publicly available upon completion of internal review.|Ying Zhou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03250)|null|
|**2024-11-05**|**GIS Copilot: Towards an Autonomous GIS Agent for Spatial Analysis**|Recent advancements in Generative AI offer promising capabilities for spatial analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of generative AI with established GIS platforms remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a framework for integrating LLMs directly into existing GIS platforms, using QGIS as an example. Our approach leverages the reasoning and programming capabilities of LLMs to autonomously generate spatial analysis workflows and code through an informed agent that has comprehensive documentation of key GIS tools and parameters. The implementation of this framework resulted in the development of a "GIS Copilot" that allows GIS users to interact with QGIS using natural language commands for spatial analysis. The GIS Copilot was evaluated based on three complexity levels: basic tasks that require one GIS tool and typically involve one data layer to perform simple operations; intermediate tasks involving multi-step processes with multiple tools, guided by user instructions; and advanced tasks which involve multi-step processes that require multiple tools but not guided by user instructions, necessitating the agent to independently decide on and executes the necessary steps. The evaluation reveals that the GIS Copilot demonstrates strong potential in automating foundational GIS operations, with a high success rate in tool selection and code generation for basic and intermediate tasks, while challenges remain in achieving full autonomy for more complex tasks. This study contributes to the emerging vision of Autonomous GIS, providing a pathway for non-experts to engage with geospatial analysis with minimal prior expertise. While full autonomy is yet to be achieved, the GIS Copilot demonstrates significant potential for simplifying GIS workflows and enhancing decision-making processes.|Temitope Akinboyewa et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03205)|null|
|**2024-11-04**|**Prompting with Phonemes: Enhancing LLM Multilinguality for non-Latin Script Languages**|Multilingual LLMs have achieved remarkable benchmark performance, but we find they continue to underperform on non-Latin script languages across contemporary LLM families. This discrepancy arises from the fact that LLMs are pretrained with orthographic scripts, which are dominated by Latin characters that obscure their shared phonology with non-Latin scripts. We propose leveraging phonemic transcriptions as complementary signals to induce script-invariant representations. Our study demonstrates that integrating phonemic signals improves performance across both non-Latin and Latin languages, with a particularly significant impact on closing the performance gap between the two. Through detailed experiments, we show that phonemic and orthographic scripts retrieve distinct examples for in-context learning (ICL). This motivates our proposed Mixed-ICL retrieval strategy, where further aggregation leads to our significant performance improvements for both Latin script languages (up to 12.6%) and non-Latin script languages (up to 15.1%) compared to randomized ICL retrieval.|Hoang Nguyen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02398)|null|
|**2024-11-04**|**Training-free Regional Prompting for Diffusion Transformers**|Diffusion models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in text-to-image generation. Their semantic understanding (i.e., prompt following) ability has also been greatly improved with large language models (e.g., T5, Llama). However, existing models cannot perfectly handle long and complex text prompts, especially when the text prompts contain various objects with numerous attributes and interrelated spatial relationships. While many regional prompting methods have been proposed for UNet-based models (SD1.5, SDXL), but there are still no implementations based on the recent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, such as SD3 and FLUX.1.In this report, we propose and implement regional prompting for FLUX.1 based on attention manipulation, which enables DiT with fined-grained compositional text-to-image generation capability in a training-free manner.

However, the creation process remains laborious, complex, and largely inaccessible to everyday users. In this work, we present AutoVFX, a framework that automatically creates realistic and dynamic VFX videos from a single video and natural language instructions. By carefully integrating neural scene modeling, LLM-based code generation, and physical simulation, AutoVFX is able to provide physically-grounded, photorealistic editing effects that can be controlled directly using natural language instructions. We conduct extensive experiments to validate AutoVFX's efficacy across a diverse spectrum of videos and instructions. Quantitative and qualitative results suggest that AutoVFX outperforms all competing methods by a large margin in generative quality, instruction alignment, editing versatility, and physical plausibility.|Hao-Yu Hsu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02394)|null|
|**2024-11-04**|**Adaptive Length Image Tokenization via Recurrent Allocation**|Current vision systems typically assign fixed-length representations to images, regardless of the information content. This contrasts with human intelligence - and even large language models - which allocate varying representational capacities based on entropy, context and familiarity. Inspired by this, we propose an approach to learn variable-length token representations for 2D images. Our encoder-decoder architecture recursively processes 2D image tokens, distilling them into 1D latent tokens over multiple iterations of recurrent rollouts. Each iteration refines the 2D tokens, updates the existing 1D latent tokens, and adaptively increases representational capacity by adding new tokens. This enables compression of images into a variable number of tokens, ranging from 32 to 256. We validate our tokenizer using reconstruction loss and FID metrics, demonstrating that token count aligns with image entropy, familiarity and downstream task requirements. Recurrent token processing with increasing representational capacity in each iteration shows signs of token specialization, revealing potential for object / part discovery.|Shivam Duggal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02393)|**[link](https://github.com/shivamduggal4/adaptive-length-tokenizer)**|
|**2024-11-04**|**Improving Scientific Hypothesis Generation with Knowledge Grounded Large Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various scientific domains, from natural language processing to complex problem-solving tasks. Their ability to understand and generate human-like text has opened up new possibilities for advancing scientific research, enabling tasks such as data analysis, literature review, and even experimental design. One of the most promising applications of LLMs in this context is hypothesis generation, where they can identify novel research directions by analyzing existing knowledge. However, despite their potential, LLMs are prone to generating ``hallucinations'', outputs that are plausible-sounding but factually incorrect. Such a problem presents significant challenges in scientific fields that demand rigorous accuracy and verifiability, potentially leading to erroneous or misleading conclusions. To overcome these challenges, we propose KG-CoI (Knowledge Grounded Chain of Ideas), a novel system that enhances LLM hypothesis generation by integrating external, structured knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs). KG-CoI guides LLMs through a structured reasoning process, organizing their output as a chain of ideas (CoI), and includes a KG-supported module for the detection of hallucinations. With experiments on our newly constructed hypothesis generation dataset, we demonstrate that KG-CoI not only improves the accuracy of LLM-generated hypotheses but also reduces the hallucination in their reasoning chains, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing real-world scientific research.|Guangzhi Xiong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02382)|null|
|**2024-11-04**|**Addressing Uncertainty in LLMs to Enhance Reliability in Generative AI**|In this paper, we present a dynamic semantic clustering approach inspired by the Chinese Restaurant Process, aimed at addressing uncertainty in the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). We quantify uncertainty of an LLM on a given query by calculating entropy of the generated semantic clusters. Further, we propose leveraging the (negative) likelihood of these clusters as the (non)conformity score within Conformal Prediction framework, allowing the model to predict a set of responses instead of a single output, thereby accounting for uncertainty in its predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our uncertainty quantification (UQ) technique on two well known question answering benchmarks, COQA and TriviaQA, utilizing two LLMs, Llama2 and Mistral. Our approach achieves SOTA performance in UQ, as assessed by metrics such as AUROC, AUARC, and AURAC. The proposed conformal predictor is also shown to produce smaller prediction sets while maintaining the same probabilistic guarantee of including the correct response, in comparison to existing SOTA conformal prediction baseline.|Ramneet Kaur et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02381)|null|
|**2024-11-04**|**DeeR-VLA: Dynamic Inference of Multimodal Large Language Models for Efficient Robot Execution**|MLLMs have demonstrated remarkable comprehension and reasoning capabilities with complex language and visual data. These advances have spurred the vision of establishing a generalist robotic MLLM proficient in understanding complex human instructions and accomplishing various embodied tasks. However, developing MLLMs for real-world robots is challenging due to the typically limited computation and memory capacities available on robotic platforms. In contrast, the inference of MLLMs involves storing billions of parameters and performing tremendous computation, imposing significant hardware demands. In our paper, we propose a Dynamic Early-Exit Framework for Robotic Vision-Language-Action Model (DeeR-VLA, or simply DeeR) that automatically adjusts the size of the activated MLLM based on each situation at hand. The approach leverages a multi-exit architecture in MLLMs, which allows the model to terminate processing once a proper size of the model has been activated for a specific situation, thus avoiding further redundant computation. Additionally, we develop novel algorithms that establish early-termination criteria for DeeR, conditioned on predefined demands such as average computational cost (i.e., power consumption), as well as peak computational consumption (i.e., latency) and GPU memory usage. These enhancements ensure that DeeR operates efficiently under varying resource constraints while maintaining competitive performance. On the CALVIN robot manipulation benchmark, DeeR demonstrates significant reductions in computational costs of LLM by 5.2-6.5x and GPU memory of LLM by 2-6x without compromising performance.

|**2024-11-04**|**"Give Me BF16 or Give Me Death"? Accuracy-Performance Trade-Offs in LLM Quantization**|Despite the popularity of large language model (LLM) quantization for inference acceleration, significant uncertainty remains regarding the accuracy-performance trade-offs associated with various quantization formats. We present a comprehensive empirical study of quantized accuracy, evaluating popular quantization formats (FP8, INT8, INT4) across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks, on the entire Llama-3.1 model family. Additionally, our study examines the difference in text generated by quantized models versus their uncompressed counterparts. Beyond benchmarks, we also present a couple of quantization improvements which allowed us to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy recovery results. Our investigation, encompassing over 500,000 individual evaluations, yields several key findings: (1) FP8 weight and activation quantization (W8A8-FP) is lossless across all model scales, (2) INT8 weight and activation quantization (W8A8-INT), when properly tuned, incurs surprisingly low 1-3% accuracy degradation, and (3) INT4 weight-only quantization (W4A16-INT) is competitive with 8-bit integer weight and activation quantization. To address the question of the "best" format for a given deployment environment, we conduct inference performance analysis using the popular open-source vLLM framework on various GPU architectures. We find that W4A16 offers the best cost-efficiency for synchronous deployments, and for asynchronous deployment on mid-tier GPUs. At the same time, W8A8 formats excel in asynchronous "continuous batching" deployment of mid- and large-size models on high-end GPUs. Our results provide a set of practical guidelines for deploying quantized LLMs across scales and performance requirements.|Eldar Kurtic et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02355)|null|

Fortunately, group spaces have a rich history of prior social interactions and affordances for social feedback to support creating agents that align to a group's interests and norms. We present Social-RAG, a workflow for grounding agents to social information about a group, which retrieves from prior group interactions, selects relevant social signals, and then feeds the context into a large language model to generate messages to the group. We implement this into PaperPing, our system that posts academic paper recommendations in group chat, leveraging social signals determined from formative studies with 39 researchers. From a three-month deployment in 18 channels, we observed PaperPing posted relevant messages in groups without disrupting their existing social practices, fostering group common ground.|Ruotong Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02353)|null|
|**2024-11-04**|**Can Large Language Models generalize analogy solving like people can?**|When we solve an analogy we transfer information from a known context to a new one through abstract rules and relational similarity. In people, the ability to solve analogies such as "body : feet :: table : ?" emerges in childhood, and appears to transfer easily to other domains, such as the visual domain "( : ) :: < : ?". Recent research shows that large language models (LLMs) can solve various forms of analogies. However, can LLMs generalize analogy solving to new domains like people can? To investigate this, we had children, adults, and LLMs solve a series of letter-string analogies (e.g., a b : a c :: j k : ?) in the Latin alphabet, in a near transfer domain (Greek alphabet), and a far transfer domain (list of symbols). As expected, children and adults easily generalized their knowledge to unfamiliar domains, whereas LLMs did not. This key difference between human and AI performance is evidence that these LLMs still struggle with robust human-like analogical transfer.|Claire E.

|**2024-11-01**|**SelfCodeAlign: Self-Alignment for Code Generation**|Instruction tuning is a supervised fine-tuning approach that significantly improves the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow human instructions. We propose SelfCodeAlign, the first fully transparent and permissive pipeline for self-aligning code LLMs without extensive human annotations or distillation. SelfCodeAlign employs the same base model for inference throughout the data generation process. It first extracts diverse coding concepts from high-quality seed snippets to generate new tasks. It then samples multiple responses per task, pairs each with test cases, and validates them in a sandbox environment. Finally, passing examples are selected for instruction tuning. In our primary experiments, we use SelfCodeAlign with CodeQwen1.5-7B to generate a dataset of 74k instruction-response pairs. Finetuning on this dataset leads to a model that achieves a 67.1 pass@1 on HumanEval+, surpassing CodeLlama-70B-Instruct despite being ten times smaller. Across all benchmarks, this finetuned model consistently outperforms the original version trained with OctoPack, the previous state-of-the-art method for instruction tuning without human annotations or distillation. Additionally, we show that SelfCodeAlign is effective across LLMs of various sizes, from 3B to 33B, and that the base models can benefit more from alignment with their own data distribution. We further validate each component's effectiveness in our pipeline, showing that SelfCodeAlign outperforms both direct distillation from GPT-4o and leading GPT-3.5-based distillation methods, such as OSS-Instruct and Evol-Instruct. SelfCodeAlign has also led to the creation of StarCoder2-Instruct, the first fully transparent, permissively licensed, and self-aligned code LLM that achieves state-of-the-art coding performance.|Yuxiang Wei et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24198)|**[link](https://github.com/bigcode-project/selfcodealign)**|
|**2024-10-31**|**Hidden Persuaders: LLMs' Political Leaning and Their Influence on Voters**|How could LLMs influence our democracy? We investigate LLMs' political leanings and the potential influence of LLMs on voters by conducting multiple experiments in a U.S. presidential election context. Through a voting simulation, we first demonstrate 18 open- and closed-weight LLMs' political preference for a Democratic nominee over a Republican nominee. We show how this leaning towards the Democratic nominee becomes more pronounced in instruction-tuned models compared to their base versions by analyzing their responses to candidate-policy related questions. We further explore the potential impact of LLMs on voter choice by conducting an experiment with 935 U.S. registered voters. During the experiments, participants interacted with LLMs (Claude-3, Llama-3, and GPT-4) over five exchanges. The experiment results show a shift in voter choices towards the Democratic nominee following LLM interaction, widening the voting margin from 0.7% to 4.6%, even though LLMs were not asked to persuade users to support the Democratic nominee during the discourse. This effect is larger than many previous studies on the persuasiveness of political campaigns, which have shown minimal effects in presidential elections. Many users also expressed a desire for further political interaction with LLMs. Which aspects of LLM interactions drove these shifts in voter choice requires further study. Lastly, we explore how a safety method can make LLMs more politically neutral, while leaving some open questions.|Yujin Potter et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24190)|null|
|**2024-10-31**|**Constraint Back-translation Improves Complex Instruction Following of Large Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) struggle to follow instructions with complex constraints in format, length, etc. Following the conventional instruction-tuning practice, previous works conduct post-training on complex instruction-response pairs generated by feeding complex instructions to advanced LLMs. However, even advanced LLMs cannot follow complex instructions well, thus limiting the quality of generated data. In this work, we find that existing datasets inherently contain implicit complex constraints and propose a novel data generation technique, constraint back-translation. Specifically, we take the high-quality instruction-response pairs in existing datasets and only adopt advanced LLMs to add complex constraints already met by the responses to the instructions, which naturally reduces costs and data noise. In the experiments, we adopt Llama3-70B-Instruct to back-translate constraints and create a high-quality complex instruction-response dataset, named CRAB. We present that post-training on CRAB improves multiple backbone LLMs' complex instruction-following ability, evaluated on extensive instruction-following benchmarks. We further find that constraint back-translation also serves as a useful auxiliary training objective in post-training. Our code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.|Yunjia Qi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24175)|null|

However, existing methods often remain confined to previously explored solution spaces and thus overlook the critical blind spot within LLMs' cognitive range. To address these issues, we design the Thought Space Explorer (TSE), a novel framework to expand and optimize thought structures to guide LLMs to explore their blind spots of thinking. By generating new reasoning steps and branches based on the original thought structure with various designed strategies, TSE broadens the thought space and alleviates the impact of blind spots for LLM reasoning. Experimental results on multiple levels of reasoning tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TSE. We also conduct extensive analysis to understand how structured and expansive thought can contribute to unleashing the potential of LLM reasoning capabilities.|Jinghan Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24155)|null|
|**2024-10-31**|**Language-Driven Policy Distillation for Cooperative Driving in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**|The cooperative driving technology of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for improving the efficiency and safety of transportation systems. Learning-based methods, such as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), have demonstrated strong capabilities in cooperative decision-making tasks. However, existing MARL approaches still face challenges in terms of learning efficiency and performance. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and shown remarkable abilities in various sequential decision-making tasks. To enhance the learning capabilities of cooperative agents while ensuring decision-making efficiency and cost-effectiveness, we propose LDPD, a language-driven policy distillation method for guiding MARL exploration. In this framework, a teacher agent based on LLM trains smaller student agents to achieve cooperative decision-making through its own decision-making demonstrations. The teacher agent enhances the observation information of CAVs and utilizes LLMs to perform complex cooperative decision-making reasoning, which also leverages carefully designed decision-making tools to achieve expert-level decisions, providing high-quality teaching experiences. The student agent then refines the teacher's prior knowledge into its own model through gradient policy updates. The experiments demonstrate that the students can rapidly improve their capabilities with minimal guidance from the teacher and eventually surpass the teacher's performance. Extensive experiments show that our approach demonstrates better performance and learning efficiency compared to baseline methods.|Jiaqi Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24152)|null|

However, because the output of GenAI cannot be guaranteed to be correct, manual intervention remains necessary. Some of this intervention can be automated through task-specific tools, alongside additional methodologies for correctness verification and effective prompt development. We explored the application of GenAI in assisting with code translation, language interoperability, and codebase inspection within a legacy Fortran codebase used to simulate particle interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the process, we developed a tool, CodeScribe, which combines prompt engineering with user supervision to establish an efficient process for code conversion. In this paper, we demonstrate how CodeScribe assists in converting Fortran code to C++, generating Fortran-C APIs for integrating legacy systems with modern C++ libraries, and providing developer support for code organization and algorithm implementation.

|**2024-10-31**|**Repository-Level Compositional Code Translation and Validation**|Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc.   We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans translated the entire repository of these projects consisting of 6899 source code fragments. 99.1% of the translated code fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 25.8%. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 36 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the syntactically or semantically incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.|Ali Reza Ibrahimzada et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24117)|null|
|**2024-10-31**|**Matchmaker: Self-Improving Large Language Model Programs for Schema Matching**|Schema matching -- the task of finding matches between attributes across disparate data sources with different tables and hierarchies -- is critical for creating interoperable machine learning (ML)-ready data. Addressing this fundamental data-centric problem has wide implications, especially in domains like healthcare, finance and e-commerce -- but also has the potential to benefit ML models more generally, by increasing the data available for ML model training. However, schema matching is a challenging ML task due to structural/hierarchical and semantic heterogeneity between different schemas. Previous ML approaches to automate schema matching have either required significant labeled data for model training, which is often unrealistic or suffer from poor zero-shot performance. To this end, we propose Matchmaker - a compositional language model program for schema matching, comprised of candidate generation, refinement and confidence scoring. Matchmaker also self-improves in a zero-shot manner without the need for labeled demonstrations via a novel optimization approach, which constructs synthetic in-context demonstrations to guide the language model's reasoning process. Empirically, we demonstrate on real-world medical schema matching benchmarks that Matchmaker outperforms previous ML-based approaches, highlighting its potential to accelerate data integration and interoperability of ML-ready data.|Nabeel Seedat et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24105)|null|
|**2024-10-31**|**Progressive Safeguards for Safe and Model-Agnostic Reinforcement Learning**|In this paper we propose a formal, model-agnostic meta-learning framework for safe reinforcement learning. Our framework is inspired by how parents safeguard their children across a progression of increasingly riskier tasks, imparting a sense of safety that is carried over from task to task. We model this as a meta-learning process where each task is synchronized with a safeguard that monitors safety and provides a reward signal to the agent. The safeguard is implemented as a finite-state machine based on a safety specification; the reward signal is formally shaped around this specification. The safety specification and its corresponding safeguard can be arbitrarily complex and non-Markovian, which adds flexibility to the training process and explainability to the learned policy. The design of the safeguard is manual but it is high-level and model-agnostic, which gives rise to an end-to-end safe learning approach with wide applicability, from pixel-level game control to language model fine-tuning. Starting from a given set of safety specifications (tasks), we train a model such that it can adapt to new specifications using only a small number of training samples. This is made possible by our method for efficiently transferring safety bias between tasks, which effectively minimizes the number of safety violations. We evaluate our framework in a Minecraft-inspired Gridworld, a VizDoom game environment, and an LLM fine-tuning application. Agents trained with our approach achieve near-minimal safety violations, while baselines are shown to underperform.|Nabil Omi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24096)|null|

This study examines LLM biases against Arabs versus Westerners across eight domains, including women's rights, terrorism, and anti-Semitism and assesses model resistance to perpetuating these biases. To this end, we create two datasets: one to evaluate LLM bias toward Arabs versus Westerners and another to test model safety against prompts that exaggerate negative traits ("jailbreaks"). We evaluate six LLMs -- GPT-4, GPT-4o, LlaMA 3.1 (8B & 405B), Mistral 7B, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. We find 79% of cases displaying negative biases toward Arabs, with LlaMA 3.1-405B being the most biased. Our jailbreak tests reveal GPT-4o as the most vulnerable, despite being an optimized version, followed by LlaMA 3.1-8B and Mistral 7B. All LLMs except Claude exhibit attack success rates above 87% in three categories. We also find Claude 3.5 Sonnet the safest, but it still displays biases in seven of eight categories. Despite being an optimized version of GPT4, We find GPT-4o to be more prone to biases and jailbreaks, suggesting optimization flaws. Our findings underscore the pressing need for more robust bias mitigation strategies and strengthened security measures in LLMs.|Muhammed Saeed et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24049)|null|
|**2024-10-30**|**EMMA: End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous Driving**|We introduce EMMA, an End-to-end Multimodal Model for Autonomous driving. Built on a multi-modal large language model foundation, EMMA directly maps raw camera sensor data into various driving-specific outputs, including planner trajectories, perception objects, and road graph elements. EMMA maximizes the utility of world knowledge from the pre-trained large language models, by representing all non-sensor inputs (e.g. navigation instructions and ego vehicle status) and outputs (e.g. trajectories and 3D locations) as natural language text. This approach allows EMMA to jointly process various driving tasks in a unified language space, and generate the outputs for each task using task-specific prompts. Empirically, we demonstrate EMMA's effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance in motion planning on nuScenes as well as competitive results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). EMMA also yields competitive results for camera-primary 3D object detection on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). We show that co-training EMMA with planner trajectories, object detection, and road graph tasks yields improvements across all three domains, highlighting EMMA's potential as a generalist model for autonomous driving applications. However, EMMA also exhibits certain limitations: it can process only a small amount of image frames, does not incorporate accurate 3D sensing modalities like LiDAR or radar and is computationally expensive. We hope that our results will inspire further research to mitigate these issues and to further evolve the state of the art in autonomous driving model architectures.|Jyh-Jing Hwang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23262)|null|
|**2024-10-30**|**Evaluating Cultural and Social Awareness of LLM Web Agents**|As large language models (LLMs) expand into performing as agents for real-world applications beyond traditional NLP tasks, evaluating their robustness becomes increasingly important. However, existing benchmarks often overlook critical dimensions like cultural and social awareness. To address these, we introduce CASA, a benchmark designed to assess LLM agents' sensitivity to cultural and social norms across two web-based tasks: online shopping and social discussion forums. Our approach evaluates LLM agents' ability to detect and appropriately respond to norm-violating user queries and observations. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that measures awareness coverage, helpfulness in managing user queries, and the violation rate when facing misleading web content. Experiments show that current LLMs perform significantly better in non-agent than in web-based agent environments, with agents achieving less than 10% awareness coverage and over 40% violation rates. To improve performance, we explore two methods: prompting and fine-tuning, and find that combining both methods can offer complementary advantages -- fine-tuning on culture-specific datasets significantly enhances the agents' ability to generalize across different regions, while prompting boosts the agents' ability to navigate complex tasks. These findings highlight the importance of constantly benchmarking LLM agents' cultural and social awareness during the development cycle.|Haoyi Qiu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23252)|null|
|**2024-10-30**|**Carrot and Stick: Eliciting Comparison Data and Beyond**|Comparison data elicited from people are fundamental to many machine learning tasks, including reinforcement learning from human feedback for large language models and estimating ranking models. They are typically subjective and not directly verifiable. How to truthfully elicit such comparison data from rational individuals? We design peer prediction mechanisms for eliciting comparison data using a bonus-penalty payment. Our design leverages on the strong stochastic transitivity for comparison data to create symmetrically strongly truthful mechanisms such that truth-telling 1) forms a strict Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and 2) yields the highest payment among all symmetric equilibria. Each individual only needs to evaluate one pair of items and report her comparison in our mechanism.   We further extend the bonus-penalty payment concept to eliciting networked data, designing a symmetrically strongly truthful mechanism when agents' private signals are sampled according to the Ising models. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for our bonus-penalty payment to have truth-telling as a strict Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Experiments on two real-world datasets further support our theoretical discoveries.|Yiling Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23243)|null|
|**2024-10-30**|**A little less conversation, a little more action, please: Investigating the physical common-sense of LLMs in a 3D embodied environment**|As general-purpose tools, Large Language Models (LLMs) must often reason about everyday physical environments. In a question-and-answer capacity, understanding the interactions of physical objects may be necessary to give appropriate responses. Moreover, LLMs are increasingly used as reasoning engines in agentic systems, designing and controlling their action sequences. The vast majority of research has tackled this issue using static benchmarks, comprised of text or image-based questions about the physical world. However, these benchmarks do not capture the complexity and nuance of real-life physical processes. Here we advocate for a second, relatively unexplored, approach: 'embodying' the LLMs by granting them control of an agent within a 3D environment. We present the first embodied and cognitively meaningful evaluation of physical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. Our framework allows direct comparison of LLMs with other embodied agents, such as those based on Deep Reinforcement Learning, and human and non-human animals. We employ the Animal-AI (AAI) environment, a simulated 3D virtual laboratory, to study physical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. For this, we use the AAI Testbed, a suite of experiments that replicate laboratory studies with non-human animals, to study physical reasoning capabilities including distance estimation, tracking out-of-sight objects, and tool use. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-modal models with no finetuning can complete this style of task, allowing meaningful comparison to the entrants of the 2019 Animal-AI Olympics competition and to human children. Our results show that LLMs are currently outperformed by human children on these tasks. We argue that this approach allows the study of physical reasoning using ecologically valid experiments drawn directly from cognitive science, improving the predictability and reliability of LLMs.|Matteo G.

|**2024-10-30**|**EMOTION: Expressive Motion Sequence Generation for Humanoid Robots with In-Context Learning**|This paper introduces a framework, called EMOTION, for generating expressive motion sequences in humanoid robots, enhancing their ability to engage in humanlike non-verbal communication. Non-verbal cues such as facial expressions, gestures, and body movements play a crucial role in effective interpersonal interactions. Despite the advancements in robotic behaviors, existing methods often fall short in mimicking the diversity and subtlety of human non-verbal communication. To address this gap, our approach leverages the in-context learning capability of large language models (LLMs) to dynamically generate socially appropriate gesture motion sequences for human-robot interaction. We use this framework to generate 10 different expressive gestures and conduct online user studies comparing the naturalness and understandability of the motions generated by EMOTION and its human-feedback version, EMOTION++, against those by human operators. The results demonstrate that our approach either matches or surpasses human performance in generating understandable and natural robot motions under certain scenarios. We also provide design implications for future research to consider a set of variables when generating expressive robotic gestures.|Peide Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23234)|null|
|**2024-10-31**|**Aligning Audio-Visual Joint Representations with an Agentic Workflow**|Visual content and accompanied audio signals naturally formulate a joint representation to improve audio-visual (AV) related applications. While studies develop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV data alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation. We observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference. Also, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams. These non-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade application performance. In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint representations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to visual data. Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM-based assistant named AVAgent. For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent uses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language descriptions separately (i.e., tool use). Then, AVAgent reasons whether this paired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e., planning). The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter noise or augment data. Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio signals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e., reflection). The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to become an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual content. To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV data via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations. The experimental results comprehensively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach against previous baselines in diverse downstream tasks.|Shentong Mo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23230)|null|
|**2024-10-30**|**COMAL: A Convergent Meta-Algorithm for Aligning LLMs with General Preferences**|Many alignment methods, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), rely on the Bradley-Terry reward assumption, which is insufficient to capture the full range of general human preferences. To achieve robust alignment with general preferences, we model the alignment problem as a two-player zero-sum game, where the Nash equilibrium policy guarantees a 50% win rate against any competing policy. However, previous algorithms for finding the Nash policy either diverge or converge to a Nash policy in a modified game, even in a simple synthetic setting, thereby failing to maintain the 50% win rate guarantee against all other policies. We propose a meta-algorithm, Convergent Meta Alignment Algorithm (COMAL), for language model alignment with general preferences, inspired by convergent algorithms in game theory. Theoretically, we prove that our meta-algorithm converges to an exact Nash policy in the last iterate. Additionally, our meta-algorithm is simple and can be integrated with many existing methods designed for RLHF and preference optimization with minimal changes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework when combined with existing preference policy optimization methods.|Yixin Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23223)|**[link](https://github.com/yale-nlp/comal)**|
|**2024-10-31**|**Grounding by Trying: LLMs with Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced Retrieval**|The hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) are increasingly mitigated by allowing LLMs to search for information and to ground their answers in real sources. Unfortunately, LLMs often struggle with posing the right search queries, especially when dealing with complex or otherwise indirect topics. Observing that LLMs can learn to search for relevant facts by $\textit{trying}$ different queries and learning to up-weight queries that successfully produce relevant results, we introduce $\underline{Le}$arning to $\underline{Re}$trieve by $\underline{T}$ rying (LeReT), a reinforcement learning framework that explores search queries and uses preference-based optimization to improve their quality. LeReT can improve the absolute retrieval accuracy by up to 29% and the downstream generator evaluations by 17%. The simplicity and flexibility of LeReT allows it to be applied to arbitrary off-the-shelf retrievers and makes it a promising technique for improving general LLM pipelines.

In this paper, we introduce a novel robust attention mechanism designed to enhance the resilience of transformer-based architectures. Crucially, this technique can be integrated into existing transformers as a plug-and-play layer, improving their robustness without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our ProTransformer significantly enhances the robustness of transformer models across a variety of prediction tasks, attack mechanisms, backbone architectures, and data domains. Notably, without further fine-tuning, the ProTransformer consistently improves the performance of vanilla transformers by 19.5%, 28.3%, 16.1%, and 11.4% for BERT, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, respectively, under the classical TextFooler attack. Furthermore, ProTransformer shows promising resilience in large language models (LLMs) against prompting-based attacks, improving the performance of T5 and LLaMA by 24.8% and 17.8%, respectively, and enhancing Vicuna by an average of 10.4% against the Jailbreaking attack. Beyond the language domain, ProTransformer also demonstrates outstanding robustness in both vision and graph domains.|Zhichao Hou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23182)|null|

In contrast to conventional recommendation systems that rely on implicit user-item interactions, ReasoningRec employs LLMs to model users and items, focusing on preferences, aversions, and explanatory reasoning. The framework utilizes a larger LLM to generate synthetic explanations for user preferences, subsequently used to fine-tune a smaller LLM for enhanced recommendation accuracy and human-interpretable explanation. Our experimental study investigates the impact of reasoning and contextual information on personalized recommendations, revealing that the quality of contextual and personalized data significantly influences the LLM's capacity to generate plausible explanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ReasoningRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to 12.5\% in recommendation prediction while concurrently providing human-intelligible explanations.

Using an advanced Large Language Model, our approach yields a 5.78% precision increase in the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, improving from 0.79 to 0.8478, and a 2.17% recall boost in the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, rising from 0.731 to 0.7527. These results underscore Generative AI's value in advancing code comment classification models, offering significant potential for enhanced accuracy in software development and quality control.

Existing methods in this direction typically concern an offline setting where a dataset containing a mix of real and machine-generated texts is given upfront, and the task is to determine whether each sample in the dataset is from a large language model (LLM) or a human. However, in many practical scenarios, sources such as news websites, social media accounts, or on other forums publish content in a streaming fashion. Therefore, in this online scenario, how to quickly and accurately determine whether the source is an LLM with strong statistical guarantees is crucial for these media or platforms to function effectively and prevent the spread of misinformation and other potential misuse of LLMs. To tackle the problem of online detection, we develop an algorithm based on the techniques of sequential hypothesis testing by betting that not only builds upon and complements existing offline detection techniques but also enjoys statistical guarantees, which include a controlled false positive rate and the expected time to correctly identify a source as an LLM. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.|Can Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22318)|**[link](https://github.com/canchen-cc/online-llm-detection)**|
|**2024-10-29**|**Understanding Synthetic Context Extension via Retrieval Heads**|Long-context LLMs are increasingly in demand for applications such as retrieval-augmented generation. To defray the cost of pretraining LLMs over long contexts, recent work takes an approach of synthetic context extension: fine-tuning LLMs with synthetically generated long-context data in a post-training stage. However, it remains unclear how and why this synthetic context extension imparts abilities for downstream long-context tasks. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning on synthetic data for three long-context tasks that require retrieval and reasoning. We vary the realism of "needle" concepts to be retrieved and diversity of the surrounding "haystack" context, from using LLMs to construct synthetic documents to using templated relations and creating symbolic datasets. We find that models trained on synthetic data fall short of the real data, but surprisingly, the mismatch can be interpreted and even predicted in terms of a special set of attention heads that are responsible for retrieval over long context: retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2024). The retrieval heads learned on synthetic data are mostly subsets of the retrieval heads learned on real data, and there is a strong correlation between the recall of heads learned and the downstream performance of a model. Furthermore, with attention knockout and activation patching, we mechanistically show that retrieval heads are necessary and explain model performance, although they are not totally sufficient. Our results shed light on how to interpret synthetic data fine-tuning performance and how to approach creating better data for learning real-world capabilities over long contexts.|Xinyu Zhao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22316)|null|
|**2024-10-29**|**Natural Language Inference Improves Compositionality in Vision-Language Models**|Compositional reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains challenging as these models often struggle to relate objects, attributes, and spatial relationships. Recent methods aim to address these limitations by relying on the semantics of the textual description, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to break them down into subsets of questions and answers. However, these methods primarily operate on the surface level, failing to incorporate deeper lexical understanding while introducing incorrect assumptions generated by the LLM. In response to these issues, we present Caption Expansion with Contradictions and Entailments (CECE), a principled approach that leverages Natural Language Inference (NLI) to generate entailments and contradictions from a given premise. CECE produces lexically diverse sentences while maintaining their core meaning. Through extensive experiments, we show that CECE enhances interpretability and reduces overreliance on biased or superficial features. By balancing CECE along the original premise, we achieve significant improvements over previous methods without requiring additional fine-tuning, producing state-of-the-art results on benchmarks that score agreement with human judgments for image-text alignment, and achieving an increase in performance on Winoground of +19.2% (group score) and +12.9% on EqBen (group score) over the best prior work (finetuned with targeted data).|Paola Cascante-Bonilla et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22315)|null|
|**2024-10-30**|**GPT-4o reads the mind in the eyes**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of reproducing human-like inferences, including inferences about emotions and mental states, from text. Whether this capability extends beyond text to other modalities remains unclear. Humans possess a sophisticated ability to read the mind in the eyes of other people. Here we tested whether this ability is also present in GPT-4o, a multimodal LLM. Using two versions of a widely used theory of mind test, the Reading the Mind in Eyes Test and the Multiracial Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, we found that GPT-4o outperformed humans in interpreting mental states from upright faces but underperformed humans when faces were inverted. While humans in our sample showed no difference between White and Non-white faces, GPT-4o's accuracy was higher for White than for Non-white faces. GPT-4o's errors were not random but revealed a highly consistent, yet incorrect, processing of mental-state information across trials, with an orientation-dependent error structure that qualitatively differed from that of humans for inverted faces but not for upright faces. These findings highlight how advanced mental state inference abilities and human-like face processing signatures, such as inversion effects, coexist in GPT-4o alongside substantial differences in information processing compared to humans.|James W.

|**2024-10-29**|**SVIP: Towards Verifiable Inference of Open-source Large Language Models**|Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, leading to widespread adoption across various domains. However, their increasing model sizes render local deployment impractical for individual users, pushing many to rely on computing service providers for inference through a blackbox API. This reliance introduces a new risk: a computing provider may stealthily substitute the requested LLM with a smaller, less capable model without consent from users, thereby delivering inferior outputs while benefiting from cost savings. In this paper, we formalize the problem of verifiable inference for LLMs. Existing verifiable computing solutions based on cryptographic or game-theoretic techniques are either computationally uneconomical or rest on strong assumptions. We introduce SVIP, a secret-based verifiable LLM inference protocol that leverages intermediate outputs from LLM as unique model identifiers. By training a proxy task on these outputs and requiring the computing provider to return both the generated text and the processed intermediate outputs, users can reliably verify whether the computing provider is acting honestly. In addition, the integration of a secret mechanism further enhances the security of our protocol. We thoroughly analyze our protocol under multiple strong and adaptive adversarial scenarios. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SVIP is accurate, generalizable, computationally efficient, and resistant to various attacks. Notably, SVIP achieves false negative rates below 5% and false positive rates below 3%, while requiring less than 0.01 seconds per query for verification.|Yifan Sun et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22307)|null|

We train the Flow using online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) learning with rollouts, generating DPO pairs for each training example and updating models in real-time.

|**2024-10-29**|**LLMs are Highly-Constrained Biophysical Sequence Optimizers**|Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown significant potential in various biological tasks such as protein engineering and molecule design. These tasks typically involve black-box discrete sequence optimization, where the challenge lies in generating sequences that are not only biologically feasible but also adhere to hard fine-grained constraints. However, LLMs often struggle with such constraints, especially in biological contexts where verifying candidate solutions is costly and time-consuming. In this study, we explore the possibility of employing LLMs as highly-constrained bilevel optimizers through a methodology we refer to as Language Model Optimization with Margin Expectation (LLOME). This approach combines both offline and online optimization, utilizing limited oracle evaluations to iteratively enhance the sequences generated by the LLM. We additionally propose a novel training objective -- Margin-Aligned Expectation (MargE) -- that trains the LLM to smoothly interpolate between the reward and reference distributions. Lastly, we introduce a synthetic test suite that bears strong geometric similarity to real biophysical problems and enables rapid evaluation of LLM optimizers without time-consuming lab validation. Our findings reveal that, in comparison to genetic algorithm baselines, LLMs achieve significantly lower regret solutions while requiring fewer test function evaluations. However, we also observe that LLMs exhibit moderate miscalibration, are susceptible to generator collapse, and have difficulty finding the optimal solution when no explicit ground truth rewards are available.|Angelica Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22296)|null|
|**2024-10-29**|**Fine-Tuning LLMs for Code Mutation: A New Era of Cyber Threats**|Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved their capabilities in natural language processing and code synthesis, enabling more complex applications across different fields. This paper explores the application of LLMs in the context of code mutation, a process where the structure of program code is altered without changing its functionality. Traditionally, code mutation has been employed to increase software robustness in mission-critical applications. Additionally, mutation engines have been exploited by malware developers to evade the signature-based detection methods employed by malware detection systems. Existing code mutation engines, often used by such threat actors, typically result in only limited variations in the malware, which can still be identified through static code analysis. However, the agility demonstrated by an LLM-based code synthesizer could significantly change this threat landscape by allowing for more complex code mutations that are not easily detected using static analysis. One can increase variations of codes synthesized by a pre-trained LLM through fine-tuning and retraining. This process is what we refer to as code mutation training. In this paper, we propose a novel definition of code mutation training tailored for pre-trained LLM-based code synthesizers and demonstrate this training on a lightweight pre-trained model. Our approach involves restructuring (i.e., mutating) code at the subroutine level, which allows for more manageable mutations while maintaining the semantic integrity verified through unit testing. Our experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving code mutation capabilities of LLM-based program synthesizers in producing varied and functionally correct code solutions, showcasing their potential to transform the landscape of code mutation and the threats associated with it.|Mohammad Setak et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22293)|null|

However, LLMs are found to be vulnerable to various adversarial attacks, particularly prompt injection attacks, which trick them into producing harmful or inappropriate content. Adversaries execute such attacks by crafting malicious prompts to deceive the LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on embedding-based Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to protect LLM-based applications against this severe threat. We leverage three commonly used embedding models to generate embeddings of malicious and benign prompts and utilize ML classifiers to predict whether an input prompt is malicious. Out of several traditional ML methods, we achieve the best performance with classifiers built using Random Forest and XGBoost.

|**2024-10-28**|**Arithmetic Without Algorithms: Language Models Solve Math With a Bag of Heuristics**|Do large language models (LLMs) solve reasoning tasks by learning robust generalizable algorithms, or do they memorize training data? To investigate this question, we use arithmetic reasoning as a representative task. Using causal analysis, we identify a subset of the model (a circuit) that explains most of the model's behavior for basic arithmetic logic and examine its functionality. By zooming in on the level of individual circuit neurons, we discover a sparse set of important neurons that implement simple heuristics. Each heuristic identifies a numerical input pattern and outputs corresponding answers. We hypothesize that the combination of these heuristic neurons is the mechanism used to produce correct arithmetic answers. To test this, we categorize each neuron into several heuristic types-such as neurons that activate when an operand falls within a certain range-and find that the unordered combination of these heuristic types is the mechanism that explains most of the model's accuracy on arithmetic prompts. Finally, we demonstrate that this mechanism appears as the main source of arithmetic accuracy early in training. Overall, our experimental results across several LLMs show that LLMs perform arithmetic using neither robust algorithms nor memorization; rather, they rely on a "bag of heuristics".|Yaniv Nikankin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21272)|null|
|**2024-10-28**|**EoRA: Training-free Compensation for Compressed LLM with Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation**|In this work, we re-formulate the model compression problem into the customized compensation problem: Given a compressed model, we aim to introduce residual low-rank paths to compensate for compression errors under customized requirements from users (e.g., tasks, compression ratios), resulting in greater flexibility in adjusting overall capacity without being constrained by specific compression formats. However, naively applying SVD to derive residual paths causes suboptimal utilization of the low-rank representation capacity. Instead, we propose Training-free Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation (EoRA), a method that directly minimizes compression-induced errors without requiring gradient-based training, achieving fast optimization in minutes using a small amount of calibration data. EoRA projects compression errors into the eigenspace of input activations, leveraging eigenvalues to effectively prioritize the reconstruction of high-importance error components. Moreover, EoRA can be seamlessly integrated with fine-tuning and quantization to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. EoRA consistently outperforms previous methods in compensating errors for compressed LLaMA2/3 models on various tasks, such as language generation, commonsense reasoning, and math reasoning tasks (e.g., 31.31%/12.88% and 9.69% improvements on ARC-Easy/ARC-Challenge and MathQA when compensating LLaMA3-8B that is quantized to 4-bit and pruned to 2:4 sparsity). EoRA offers a scalable, training-free solution to compensate for compression errors, making it a powerful tool to deploy LLMs in various capacity and efficiency requirements.|Shih-Yang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21271)|null|
|**2024-10-28**|**LARP: Tokenizing Videos with a Learned Autoregressive Generative Prior**|We present LARP, a novel video tokenizer designed to overcome limitations in current video tokenization methods for autoregressive (AR) generative models. Unlike traditional patchwise tokenizers that directly encode local visual patches into discrete tokens, LARP introduces a holistic tokenization scheme that gathers information from the visual content using a set of learned holistic queries. This design allows LARP to capture more global and semantic representations, rather than being limited to local patch-level information. Furthermore, it offers flexibility by supporting an arbitrary number of discrete tokens, enabling adaptive and efficient tokenization based on the specific requirements of the task. To align the discrete token space with downstream AR generation tasks, LARP integrates a lightweight AR transformer as a training-time prior model that predicts the next token on its discrete latent space. By incorporating the prior model during training, LARP learns a latent space that is not only optimized for video reconstruction but is also structured in a way that is more conducive to autoregressive generation. Moreover, this process defines a sequential order for the discrete tokens, progressively pushing them toward an optimal configuration during training, ensuring smoother and more accurate AR generation at inference time. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LARP's strong performance, achieving state-of-the-art FVD on the UCF101 class-conditional video generation benchmark. LARP enhances the compatibility of AR models with videos and opens up the potential to build unified high-fidelity multimodal large language models (MLLMs).|Hanyu Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21264)|null|
|**2024-10-28**|**Are BabyLMs Second Language Learners?**|This paper describes a linguistically-motivated approach to the 2024 edition of the BabyLM Challenge (Warstadt et al. 2023). Rather than pursuing a first language learning (L1) paradigm, we approach the challenge from a second language (L2) learning perspective. In L2 learning, there is a stronger focus on learning explicit linguistic information, such as grammatical notions, definitions of words or different ways of expressing a meaning. This makes L2 learning potentially more efficient and concise. We approximate this using data from Wiktionary, grammar examples either generated by an LLM or sourced from grammar books, and paraphrase data. We find that explicit information about word meaning (in our case, Wiktionary) does not boost model performance, while grammatical information can give a small improvement. The most impactful data ingredient is sentence paraphrases, with our two best models being trained on 1) a mix of paraphrase data and data from the BabyLM pretraining dataset, and 2) exclusively paraphrase data.|Lukas Edman et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21254)|null|

In principle, reinforcement learning (RL) with appropriate reward signals can further enhance models' capacities. However, how to obtain reliable rewards in long-context scenarios remains unexplored. To this end, we propose LongReward, a novel method that utilizes an off-the-shelf LLM to provide rewards for long-context model responses from four human-valued dimensions: helpfulness, logicality, faithfulness, and completeness, each with a carefully designed assessment pipeline. By combining LongReward and offline RL algorithm DPO, we are able to effectively improve long-context SFT models. Our experiments indicate that LongReward not only significantly improves models' long-context performance but also enhances their ability to follow short instructions. We also find that long-context DPO with LongReward and conventional short-context DPO can be used together without hurting either one's performance.|Jiajie Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21252)|null|
|**2024-10-28**|**Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval with Embeddings from Relevance Feedback**|Building effective dense retrieval systems remains difficult when relevance supervision is not available. Recent work has looked to overcome this challenge by using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate hypothetical documents that can be used to find the closest real document. However, this approach relies solely on the LLM to have domain-specific knowledge relevant to the query, which may not be practical. Furthermore, generating hypothetical documents can be inefficient as it requires the LLM to generate a large number of tokens for each query. To address these challenges, we introduce Real Document Embeddings from Relevance Feedback (ReDE-RF). Inspired by relevance feedback, ReDE-RF proposes to re-frame hypothetical document generation as a relevance estimation task, using an LLM to select which documents should be used for nearest neighbor search. Through this re-framing, the LLM no longer needs domain-specific knowledge but only needs to judge what is relevant. Additionally, relevance estimation only requires the LLM to output a single token, thereby improving search latency.

|**2024-10-28**|**Flaming-hot Initiation with Regular Execution Sampling for Large Language Models**|Since the release of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains. A key challenge in developing these general capabilities is efficiently sourcing diverse, high-quality data. This becomes especially critical in reasoning-related tasks with sandbox checkers, such as math or code, where the goal is to generate correct solutions to specific problems with higher probability. In this work, we introduce Flaming-hot Initiation with Regular Execution (FIRE) sampling, a simple yet highly effective method to efficiently find good responses. Our empirical findings show that FIRE sampling enhances inference-time generation quality and also benefits training in the alignment stage.

|**2024-10-28**|**LoRA vs Full Fine-tuning: An Illusion of Equivalence**|Fine-tuning is a crucial paradigm for adapting pre-trained large language models to downstream tasks. Recently, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been shown to match the performance of fully fine-tuned models on various tasks with an extreme reduction in the number of trainable parameters. Even in settings where both methods learn similarly accurate models, \emph{are their learned solutions really equivalent?} We study how different fine-tuning methods change pre-trained models by analyzing the model's weight matrices through the lens of their spectral properties. We find that full fine-tuning and LoRA yield weight matrices whose singular value decompositions exhibit very different structure; moreover, the fine-tuned models themselves show distinct generalization behaviors when tested outside the adaptation task's distribution. More specifically, we first show that the weight matrices trained with LoRA have new, high-ranking singular vectors, which we call \emph{intruder dimensions}. Intruder dimensions do not appear during full fine-tuning. Second, we show that LoRA models with intruder dimensions, despite achieving similar performance to full fine-tuning on the target task, become worse models of the pre-training distribution and adapt less robustly to multiple tasks sequentially. Higher-rank, rank-stabilized LoRA models closely mirror full fine-tuning, even when performing on par with lower-rank LoRA models on the same tasks. These results suggest that models updated with LoRA and full fine-tuning access different parts of parameter space, even when they perform equally on the fine-tuned distribution. We conclude by examining why intruder dimensions appear in LoRA fine-tuned models, why they are undesirable, and how their effects can be minimized.|Reece Shuttleworth et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21228)|null|
|**2024-10-28**|**Lifting the Veil on the Large Language Model Supply Chain: Composition, Risks, and Mitigations**|Large language models (LLM) have sparked significant impact with regard to both intelligence and productivity. In recent years, a great surge has been witnessed in the introduction of both commercial and open-source LLMs. Many businesses have adopted the LLMs into their applications to solve their own domain-specific tasks. However, integrating LLMs into specific business scenarios requires more than just utilizing the models themselves. Instead, it is a systematic process that involves substantial components, which are collectively referred to as the LLM supply chain. The LLM supply chain inherently carries risks. Therefore, it is essential to understand the types of components that may be introduced into the supply chain and the associated risks, enabling different stakeholders to implement effective mitigation measures. While some literature touches on risks associated with the LLM supply chain, there is currently no paper that explicitly defines its scope, identifies inherent risks, and examines potential mitigation strategies. As LLMs have become essential infrastructure in the new era, we believe that a thorough review of the LLM supply chain, along with its inherent risks and mitigation strategies, would be valuable for industry practitioners to avoid potential damages and losses, and enlightening for academic researchers to rethink existing approaches and explore new avenues of research. Our paper provides a comprehensive overview of the LLM supply chain, detailing the stakeholders, composing artifacts, and the supplying types. We developed taxonomies of risk types, risky actions, and mitigations related to various supply chain stakeholders and components. In summary, our work explores the technical and operational aspects of the LLM supply chain, offering valuable insights for researchers and engineers in the evolving LLM landscape.|Kaifeng Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21218)|null|

Although no effective treatments currently exist to reverse Alzheimer's, prevention and early intervention, including cognitive training, are critical. This report explores the potential of AI chatbots in enhancing personalized cognitive training. We introduce ReMe, a web-based framework designed to create AI chatbots that facilitate cognitive training research, specifically targeting episodic memory tasks derived from personal life logs. By leveraging large language models, ReMe provides enhanced user-friendly, interactive, and personalized training experiences. Case studies demonstrate ReMe's effectiveness in engaging users through life recall and open-ended language puzzles, highlighting its potential to improve cognitive training design. Despite promising results, further research is needed to validate training effectiveness through large-scale studies that include cognitive ability evaluations. Overall, ReMe offers a promising approach to personalized cognitive training, utilizing AI capabilities to meet the growing demand for non-pharmacological interventions in cognitive health, with future research aiming to expand its applications and efficacy.|Zilong Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19733)|null|
|**2024-10-25**|**Counting Ability of Large Language Models and Impact of Tokenization**|Transformers, the backbone of modern large language models (LLMs), face inherent architectural limitations that impede their reasoning capabilities. Unlike recurrent networks, Transformers lack recurrent connections, confining them to constant-depth computation. This restriction places them in the complexity class TC $^0$ , making them theoretically incapable of solving tasks that demand increasingly deep reasoning as input length grows. Counting, a fundamental component of many reasoning tasks, also requires reasoning depth to grow linearly to be performed inductively. While previous studies have established the upper limits of counting ability in Transformer-based expert models (i.e., models specifically trained for counting tasks), these findings do not directly extend to general-purpose LLMs due to differences in reasoning mechanisms. Recent work has highlighted how Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning can help alleviate some of the architectural limitations of Transformers in counting tasks. However, little attention has been paid to the role of tokenization in these models. Unlike expert models that often use character-level tokenization, LLMs typically rely on byte-level (BPE) tokenizers, which fundamentally alters the way reasoning is processed. Our work investigates the impact of tokenization on the counting abilities of LLMs, uncovering substantial performance variations based on input tokenization differences. We provide both theoretical and experimental analyses, offering insights into how tokenization choices can undermine models' theoretical computability, thereby inspiring the design of new tokenization methods to enhance reasoning in LLMs.|Xiang Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19730)|null|

Recently, fine-tuned financial domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs), have emerged. While these advancements are promising, limitations such as high inference costs, hallucinations, and the complexity of concurrently analyzing high-dimensional financial data, emerge. This motivates our invention FISHNET (Financial Intelligence from Sub-querying, Harmonizing, Neural-Conditioning, Expert swarming, and Task planning), an agentic architecture that accomplishes highly complex analytical tasks for more than 98,000 regulatory filings that vary immensely in terms of semantics, data hierarchy, or format. FISHNET shows remarkable performance for financial insight generation (61.8% success rate over 5.0% Routing, 45.6% RAG R-Precision). We conduct rigorous ablations to empirically prove the success of FISHNET, each agent's importance, and the optimized performance of assembling all agents. Our modular architecture can be leveraged for a myriad of use-cases, enabling scalability, flexibility, and data integrity that are critical for financial tasks.|Nicole Cho et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19727)|null|
|**2024-10-25**|**2D-DPO: Scaling Direct Preference Optimization with 2-Dimensional Supervision**|Recent advancements in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have significantly enhanced the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, owing to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, existing methods typically optimize a scalar score or ranking reward, thereby overlooking the multi-dimensional nature of human preferences. In this work, we propose to extend the preference of DPO to two dimensions: segments and aspects. We first introduce a 2D supervision dataset called HelpSteer-2D. For the segment dimension, we divide the response into sentences and assign scores to each segment. For the aspect dimension, we meticulously design several criteria covering the response quality rubrics. With the 2-dimensional signals as feedback, we develop a 2D-DPO framework, decomposing the overall objective into multi-segment and multi-aspect objectives. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that 2D-DPO performs better than methods that optimize for scalar or 1-dimensional preferences.|Shilong Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19720)|null|

However, understanding long-form videos still remains challenging for MLLMs. This paper proposes TimeSuite, a collection of new designs to adapt the existing short-form video MLLMs for long video understanding, including a simple yet efficient framework to process long video sequence, a high-quality video dataset for grounded tuning of MLLMs, and a carefully-designed instruction tuning task to explicitly incorporate the grounding supervision in the traditional QA format. Specifically, based on VideoChat, we propose our long-video MLLM, coined as VideoChat-T, by implementing a token shuffling to compress long video tokens and introducing Temporal Adaptive Position Encoding (TAPE) to enhance the temporal awareness of visual representation. Meanwhile, we introduce the TimePro, a comprehensive grounding-centric instruction tuning dataset composed of 9 tasks and 349k high-quality grounded annotations. Notably, we design a new instruction tuning task type, called Temporal Grounded Caption, to peform detailed video descriptions with the corresponding time stamps prediction. This explicit temporal location prediction will guide MLLM to correctly attend on the visual content when generating description, and thus reduce the hallucination risk caused by the LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our TimeSuite provides a successful solution to enhance the long video understanding capability of short-form MLLM, achieving improvement of 5.6% and 6.8% on the benchmarks of Egoschema and VideoMME, respectively. In addition, VideoChat-T exhibits robust zero-shot temporal grounding capabilities, significantly outperforming the existing state-of-the-art MLLMs. After fine-tuning, it performs on par with the traditional supervised expert models.|Xiangyu Zeng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19702)|null|
|**2024-10-25**|**IPPON: Common Sense Guided Informative Path Planning for Object Goal Navigation**|Navigating efficiently to an object in an unexplored environment is a critical skill for general-purpose intelligent robots. Recent approaches to this object goal navigation problem have embraced a modular strategy, integrating classical exploration algorithms-notably frontier exploration-with a learned semantic mapping/exploration module. This paper introduces a novel informative path planning and 3D object probability mapping approach. The mapping module computes the probability of the object of interest through semantic segmentation and a Bayes filter. Additionally, it stores probabilities for common objects, which semantically guides the exploration based on common sense priors from a large language model. The planner terminates when the current viewpoint captures enough voxels identified with high confidence as the object of interest. Although our planner follows a zero-shot approach, it achieves state-of-the-art performance as measured by the Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) and Soft SPL in the Habitat ObjectNav Challenge 2023, outperforming other works by more than 20%. Furthermore, we validate its effectiveness on real robots. Project webpage: https://ippon-paper.github.io/|Kaixian Qu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19697)|null|
|**2024-10-25**|**Less is More: Extreme Gradient Boost Rank-1 Adaption for Efficient Finetuning of LLMs**|Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a crucial technique for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks. However, the enormous size of LLMs poses significant challenges in terms of computational complexity and resource requirements. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising solution. However, there exists a gap between the practical performance of low-rank adaptations and its theoretical optimum. In this work, we propose eXtreme Gradient Boosting LoRA (XGBLoRA), a novel framework that bridges this gap by leveraging the power of ensemble learning. Inspired by gradient boosting, XGBLoRA iteratively learns and merges a sequence of LoRA adaptations to refine model predictions. It achieves better performance than the standard LoRA, while enjoying the computational efficiency of rank-1 adaptations. We provide theoretical analysis to show the convergence and optimality of our approach, and conduct extensive experiments on a range of natural language processing tasks. The results demonstrate that XGBLoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and achieves performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly fewer trainable parameters. This work advances parameter-efficient fine-tuning for LLMs, and offers a promising solution for adapting LLMs to downstream tasks while optimizing performance and efficiency.|Yifei Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19694)|null|

We propose AGENT-CQ (Automatic GENeration, and evaluaTion of Clarifying Questions), an end-to-end LLM-based framework addressing the challenges of scalability and adaptability faced by existing methods that rely on manual curation or template-based approaches. AGENT-CQ consists of two stages: a generation stage employing LLM prompting strategies to generate clarifying questions, and an evaluation stage (CrowdLLM) that simulates human crowdsourcing judgments using multiple LLM instances to assess generated questions and answers based on comprehensive quality metrics. Extensive experiments on the ClariQ dataset demonstrate CrowdLLM's effectiveness in evaluating question and answer quality. Human evaluation and CrowdLLM show that the AGENT-CQ - generation stage, consistently outperforms baselines in various aspects of question and answer quality. In retrieval-based evaluation, LLM-generated questions significantly enhance retrieval effectiveness for both BM25 and cross-encoder models compared to human-generated questions.|Clemencia Siro et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19692)|null|
|**2024-10-25**|**APRICOT: Active Preference Learning and Constraint-Aware Task Planning with LLMs**|Home robots performing personalized tasks must adeptly balance user preferences with environmental affordances. We focus on organization tasks within constrained spaces, such as arranging items into a refrigerator, where preferences for placement collide with physical limitations. The robot must infer user preferences based on a small set of demonstrations, which is easier for users to provide than extensively defining all their requirements. While recent works use Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn preferences from user demonstrations, they encounter two fundamental challenges. First, there is inherent ambiguity in interpreting user actions, as multiple preferences can often explain a single observed behavior. Second, not all user preferences are practically feasible due to geometric constraints in the environment. To address these challenges, we introduce APRICOT, a novel approach that merges LLM-based Bayesian active preference learning with constraint-aware task planning. APRICOT refines its generated preferences by actively querying the user and dynamically adapts its plan to respect environmental constraints. We evaluate APRICOT on a dataset of diverse organization tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, showing significant improvements in both preference satisfaction and plan feasibility.

The plugin collects the parts of proofs marked with the admit tactic in a Coq file, i.e., proof holes, and combines LLMs along with non-machine-learning methods to generate proof candidates for the holes. Then, CoqPilot checks if each proof candidate solves the given subgoal and, if successful, replaces the hole with it. The focus of CoqPilot is twofold. Firstly, we want to allow users to seamlessly combine multiple Coq generation approaches and provide a zero-setup experience for our tool. Secondly, we want to deliver a platform for LLM-based experiments on Coq proof generation. We developed a benchmarking system for Coq generation methods, available in the plugin, and conducted an experiment using it, showcasing the framework's possibilities.

Inspired by James P. Carse's distinction between finite and infinite games, we leverage recent advances in generative AI to create Unbounded: a game of character life simulation that is fully encapsulated in generative models. Specifically, Unbounded draws inspiration from sandbox life simulations and allows you to interact with your autonomous virtual character in a virtual world by feeding, playing with and guiding it - with open-ended mechanics generated by an LLM, some of which can be emergent. In order to develop Unbounded, we propose technical innovations in both the LLM and visual generation domains. Specifically, we present: (1) a specialized, distilled large language model (LLM) that dynamically generates game mechanics, narratives, and character interactions in real-time, and (2) a new dynamic regional image prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) for vision models that ensures consistent yet flexible visual generation of a character across multiple environments. We evaluate our system through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, showing significant improvements in character life simulation, user instruction following, narrative coherence, and visual consistency for both characters and the environments compared to traditional related approaches.|Jialu Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18975)|null|

In this paper, we introduce Ferret-UI 2, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed for universal UI understanding across a wide range of platforms, including iPhone, Android, iPad, Webpage, and AppleTV. Building on the foundation of Ferret-UI, Ferret-UI 2 introduces three key innovations: support for multiple platform types, high-resolution perception through adaptive scaling, and advanced task training data generation powered by GPT-4o with set-of-mark visual prompting. These advancements enable Ferret-UI 2 to perform complex, user-centered interactions, making it highly versatile and adaptable for the expanding diversity of platform ecosystems. Extensive empirical experiments on referring, grounding, user-centric advanced tasks (comprising 9 subtasks $\times$ 5 platforms), GUIDE next-action prediction dataset, and GUI-World multi-platform benchmark demonstrate that Ferret-UI 2 significantly outperforms Ferret-UI, and also shows strong cross-platform transfer capabilities.|Zhangheng Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18967)|null|

A Survey and Evaluation on Detection Assumptions**|Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great performance across various benchmarks, showing potential as general-purpose task solvers. However, as LLMs are typically trained on vast amounts of data, a significant concern in their evaluation is data contamination, where overlap between training data and evaluation datasets inflates performance assessments. While multiple approaches have been developed to identify data contamination, these approaches rely on specific assumptions that may not hold universally across different settings. To bridge this gap, we systematically review 47 papers on data contamination detection, categorize the underlying assumptions, and assess whether they have been rigorously validated. We identify and analyze eight categories of assumptions and test three of them as case studies. Our analysis reveals that when classifying instances used for pretraining LLMs, detection approaches based on these three assumptions perform close to random guessing, suggesting that current LLMs learn data distributions rather than memorizing individual instances. Overall, this work underscores the importance of approaches clearly stating their underlying assumptions and testing their validity across various scenarios.|Yujuan Fu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18966)|null|

While numerical data provides a foundation, it often lacks crucial context necessary for accurate predictions. Human forecasters frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge or constraints, which can be efficiently communicated through natural language. However, the ability of existing forecasting models to effectively integrate this textual information remains an open question. To address this, we introduce "Context is Key" (CiK), a time series forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate both modalities. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models, time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on our benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporating contextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based forecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings.

This performance gap deepens the digital divide, preventing developers using LRPLs from benefiting equally from LLM advancements and reinforcing disparities in innovation within underrepresented programming communities. While generating additional training data for LRPLs is promising, it faces two key challenges: manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, and LLM-generated LRPL code is often of subpar quality. The underlying cause of this issue is the gap between natural language to programming language gap (NL-PL Gap), which is especially pronounced in LRPLs due to limited aligned data. In this work, we introduce a novel approach called Bridge-Coder, which leverages LLMs' intrinsic capabilities to enhance the performance on LRPLs. Our method consists of two key stages. Bridge Generation, where we create high-quality dataset by utilizing LLMs' general knowledge understanding, proficiency in HRPLs, and in-context learning abilities. Then, we apply the Bridged Alignment, which progressively improves the alignment between NL instructions and LRPLs. Experimental results across multiple LRPLs show that Bridge-Coder significantly enhances model performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. Furthermore, we offer a detailed analysis of the key components of our method, providing valuable insights for future work aimed at addressing the challenges associated with LRPLs.|Jipeng Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18957)|null|

However, those instruction-tuned LLMs often perform poorly in specialized medical natural language understanding (NLU) tasks that require domain knowledge, granular text comprehension, and structured data extraction. To bridge the gap, we: (1) propose a unified prompting format for 7 important NLU tasks, % through span extraction and multi-choice question-answering (QA), (2) curate an instruction-tuning dataset, MNLU-Instruct, utilizing diverse existing open-source medical NLU corpora, and (3) develop BioMistral-NLU, a generalizable medical NLU model, through fine-tuning BioMistral on MNLU-Instruct. We evaluate BioMistral-NLU in a zero-shot setting, across 6 important NLU tasks, from two widely adopted medical NLU benchmarks: Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation (BLUE) and Biomedical Language Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark (BLURB). Our experiments show that our BioMistral-NLU outperforms the original BioMistral, as well as the proprietary LLMs - ChatGPT and GPT-4. Our dataset-agnostic prompting strategy and instruction tuning step over diverse NLU tasks enhance LLMs' generalizability across diverse medical NLU tasks. Our ablation experiments show that instruction-tuning on a wider variety of tasks, even when the total number of training instances remains constant, enhances downstream zero-shot generalization.|Yujuan Velvin Fu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18955)|null|

However, this comes at the cost of slower and more expensive inference. Early-exiting is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of LLM inference by enabling next token prediction at intermediate layers. Yet, the large vocabulary size in modern LLMs makes the confidence estimation required for exit decisions computationally expensive, diminishing the efficiency gains. To address this, we propose dynamically pruning the vocabulary at test time for each token. Specifically, the vocabulary is pruned at one of the initial layers, and the smaller vocabulary is then used throughout the rest of the forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that such post-hoc dynamic vocabulary pruning improves the efficiency of confidence estimation in early-exit LLMs while maintaining competitive performance.|Jort Vincenti et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18952)|**[link](https://github.com/matteonulli/vocabulary_pruning)**|

However, we observe that existing safety benchmarks for MLLMs show limitations in query quality and evaluation reliability limiting the detection of model safety implications as MLLMs continue to evolve. In this paper, we propose \toolns, a comprehensive framework designed for conducting safety evaluations of MLLMs. Our framework consists of a comprehensive harmful query dataset and an automated evaluation protocol that aims to address the above limitations, respectively. We first design an automatic safety dataset generation pipeline, where we employ a set of LLM judges to recognize and categorize the risk scenarios that are most harmful and diverse for MLLMs; based on the taxonomy, we further ask these judges to generate high-quality harmful queries accordingly resulting in 23 risk scenarios with 2,300 multi-modal harmful query pairs. During safety evaluation, we draw inspiration from the jury system in judicial proceedings and pioneer the jury deliberation evaluation protocol that adopts collaborative LLMs to evaluate whether target models exhibit specific harmful behaviors, providing a reliable and unbiased assessment of content security risks. In addition, our benchmark can also be extended to the audio modality showing high scalability and potential. Based on our framework, we conducted large-scale experiments on 15 widely-used open-source MLLMs and 6 commercial MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini), where we revealed widespread safety issues in existing MLLMs and instantiated several insights on MLLM safety performance such as image quality and parameter size.|Zonghao Ying et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18927)|null|

|**2024-10-23**|**TP-Eval: Tap Multimodal LLMs' Potential in Evaluation by Customizing Prompts**|Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have received much attention for their impressive capabilities. The evaluation of MLLMs is becoming critical to analyzing attributes of MLLMs and providing valuable insights. However, current benchmarks overlook the problem of prompt sensitivity - minor prompt variations may lead to significant performance fluctuations. Thus, inappropriate prompts may obscure the models' capabilities, underestimating the models' performance. Moreover, different models have different preferences for different prompts, and thus, using the same prompt for all models will cause evaluation bias. This paper analyzes this deficiency in existing benchmarks and further introduces a new evaluation framework named TP-Eval, which introduces a prompt customization method to reduce evaluation biases and tap models' potential. TP-Eval will rewrite the original prompts to different customized prompts for different models. In particular, we propose some well-designed modules for prompt customization tailored to the scenario of MLLM evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to uncovering models' capabilities, and TP-Eval should benefit the community in developing more comprehensive and convincing MLLM evaluation benchmarks.|Yuxuan Xie et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18071)|null|
|**2024-10-23**|**LongRAG: A Dual-Perspective Retrieval-Augmented Generation Paradigm for Long-Context Question Answering**|Long-Context Question Answering (LCQA), a challenging task, aims to reason over long-context documents to yield accurate answers to questions. Existing long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) for LCQA often struggle with the "lost in the middle" issue. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by providing external factual evidence. However, its chunking strategy disrupts the global long-context information, and its low-quality retrieval in long contexts hinders LLMs from identifying effective factual details due to substantial noise. To this end, we propose LongRAG, a general, dual-perspective, and robust LLM-based RAG system paradigm for LCQA to enhance RAG's understanding of complex long-context knowledge (i.e., global information and factual details). We design LongRAG as a plug-and-play paradigm, facilitating adaptation to various domains and LLMs. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop datasets demonstrate that LongRAG significantly outperforms long-context LLMs (up by 6.94%), advanced RAG (up by 6.16%), and Vanilla RAG (up by 17.25%). Furthermore, we conduct quantitative ablation studies and multi-dimensional analyses, highlighting the effectiveness of the system's components and fine-tuning strategies.

Adapting existing supervised and unsupervised solutions for the Russian language faces several limitations due to the rich morphology of Russian and the limited number of training datasets available. Recent studies conducted on English texts show that large language models (LLMs) successfully address the task of generating keyphrases. LLMs allow achieving impressive results without task-specific fine-tuning, using text prompts instead. In this work, we access the performance of prompt-based methods for generating keyphrases for Russian scientific abstracts. First, we compare the performance of zero-shot and few-shot prompt-based methods, fine-tuned models, and unsupervised methods. Then we assess strategies for selecting keyphrase examples in a few-shot setting. We present the outcomes of human evaluation of the generated keyphrases and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the models through expert assessment. Our results suggest that prompt-based methods can outperform common baselines even using simple text prompts.|Anna Glazkova et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18040)|null|
|**2024-10-23**|**POD-Attention: Unlocking Full Prefill-Decode Overlap for Faster LLM Inference**|Each request in LLM inference goes through two phases: compute-bound prefill and memory-bandwidth-bound decode. To improve GPU utilization, recent systems use hybrid batching that combines the prefill and decode phases of different requests into the same batch. Hybrid batching works well for linear operations as it amortizes the cost of loading model weights from HBM. However, attention computation in hybrid batches remains inefficient because existing attention kernels are optimized for either prefill or decode.   In this paper, we present POD-Attention -- the first GPU kernel that efficiently computes attention for hybrid batches. POD-Attention aims to maximize the utilization of both compute and memory bandwidth by carefully allocating the GPU's resources such that prefill and decode operations happen concurrently on the same multiprocessor. We integrate POD-Attention in a state-of-the-art LLM inference scheduler Sarathi-Serve. POD-Attention speeds up attention computation by up to 75% (mean 28%) and increases LLM serving throughput by up to 22% in offline inference. In online inference, POD-Attention enables lower time-to-first-token (TTFT), time-between-tokens (TBT), and request execution latency versus Sarathi-Serve.|Aditya K Kamath et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18038)|null|
|**2024-10-23**|**MiLoRA: Efficient Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation for Large Language Models Fine-tuning**|Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its mixture-of-experts (MOE) variants are highly effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. However, they introduce significant latency in multi-tenant settings due to the LoRA modules and MOE routers added to multiple linear modules in the Transformer layer. To address this issue, we propose Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (MiLoRA), a novel and efficient LoRA variant. MiLoRA differs from previous MOE-style LoRA methods by considering each LoRA module as an expert and employing a prompt-aware routing mechanism. This mechanism calculates expert routing results once before generating the first new token and reuses these results for subsequent tokens, reducing latency. Extensive experiments and analysis on commonsense reasoning tasks, math reasoning tasks, and widely used LLM evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that MiLoRA consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines with comparable tunable parameter budgets. Additionally, MiLoRA significantly reduces latency in multi-tenant settings compared to previous LoRA-based methods.|Jingfan Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18035)|null|
|**2024-10-23**|**GraphTeam: Facilitating Large Language Model-based Graph Analysis via Multi-Agent Collaboration**|Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing. Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.

However, research has predominantly focused on the effects of adjustments to the Federal Funds rate rather than on the decision-making process itself. Recent advancements in large language models(LLMs) offer a potential method for reconstructing the original FOMC meetings, which are responsible for setting the Federal Funds rate. In this paper, we propose a five-stage FOMC meeting simulation framework, MiniFed, which employs LLM agents to simulate real-world FOMC meeting members and optimize the FOMC structure. This framework effectively revitalizes the FOMC meeting process and facilitates projections of the Federal Funds rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MiniFed framework achieves both high accuracy in Federal Funds rate projections and behavioral alignment with the agents' real-world counterparts. Given that few studies have focused on employing LLM agents to simulate large-scale real-world conferences, our work can serve as a benchmark for future developments.|Sungil Seok et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18012)|null|
|**2024-10-23**|**ExpertFlow: Optimized Expert Activation and Token Allocation for Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Inference**|Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, while outperforming dense Large Language Models (LLMs) in terms of performance, face significant deployment challenges during inference due to their high memory demands. Existing offloading techniques, which involve swapping activated and idle experts between the GPU and CPU, often suffer from rigid expert caching mechanisms. These mechanisms fail to adapt to dynamic routing, leading to inefficient cache utilization, or incur prohibitive costs for prediction training. To tackle these inference-specific challenges, we introduce ExpertFlow, a comprehensive system specifically designed to enhance inference efficiency by accommodating flexible routing and enabling efficient expert scheduling between CPU and GPU. This reduces overhead and boosts system performance. Central to our approach is a predictive routing path-based offloading mechanism that utilizes a lightweight predictor to accurately forecast routing paths before computation begins. This proactive strategy allows for real-time error correction in expert caching, significantly increasing cache hit ratios and reducing the frequency of expert transfers, thereby minimizing I/O overhead. Additionally, we implement a dynamic token scheduling strategy that optimizes MoE inference by rearranging input tokens across different batches. This method not only reduces the number of activated experts per batch but also improves computational efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpertFlow achieves up to 93.72\% GPU memory savings and enhances inference speed by 2 to 10 times compared to baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and utility as a robust solution for resource-constrained inference scenarios.|Xin He et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17954)|null|

However, adapting general-purpose RAG systems to specialized fields such as science and medicine poses unique challenges due to distribution shifts and limited access to domain-specific data. To tackle this, we propose SimRAG, a self-training approach that equips the LLM with joint capabilities of question answering and question generation for domain adaptation. Our method first fine-tunes the LLM on instruction-following, question-answering, and search-related data. Then, it prompts the same LLM to generate diverse domain-relevant questions from unlabeled corpora, with an additional filtering strategy to retain high-quality synthetic examples. By leveraging these synthetic examples, the LLM can improve their performance on domain-specific RAG tasks. Experiments on 11 datasets, spanning two backbone sizes and three domains, demonstrate that SimRAG outperforms baselines by 1.2\%--8.6\%.|Ran Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17952)|null|

We develop a comprehensive benchmark focused on HubSpot CRM operations to evaluate ThorV2 against leading models from OpenAI and Anthropic. Our results demonstrate that ThorV2 outperforms existing models in accuracy, reliability, latency, and cost efficiency for both single and multi-API calling tasks. We also show that ThorV2 is far more reliable and scales better to multistep tasks compared to traditional models. Our work offers the tantalizing possibility of more accurate function-calling compared to today's best-performing models using significantly smaller LLMs. These advancements have significant implications for the development of more capable AI assistants and the broader application of LLMs in real-world scenarios.|Nirav Bhan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17950)|null|
|**2024-10-22**|**Towards Reliable Evaluation of Behavior Steering Interventions in LLMs**|Representation engineering methods have recently shown promise for enabling efficient steering of model behavior. However, evaluation pipelines for these methods have primarily relied on subjective demonstrations, instead of quantitative, objective metrics. We aim to take a step towards addressing this issue by advocating for four properties missing from current evaluations: (i) contexts sufficiently similar to downstream tasks should be used for assessing intervention quality; (ii) model likelihoods should be accounted for; (iii) evaluations should allow for standardized comparisons across different target behaviors; and (iv) baseline comparisons should be offered. We introduce an evaluation pipeline grounded in these criteria, offering both a quantitative and visual analysis of how effectively a given method works. We use this pipeline to evaluate two representation engineering methods on how effectively they can steer behaviors such as truthfulness and corrigibility, finding that some interventions are less effective than previously reported.|Itamar Pres et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17245)|null|

While LLM-based agents have shown promise in automating machine learning tasks, they often generate low-diversity and suboptimal code, even after multiple iterations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Tree-Search Enhanced LLM Agents (SELA), an innovative agent-based system that leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the AutoML process. By representing pipeline configurations as trees, our framework enables agents to conduct experiments intelligently and iteratively refine their strategies, facilitating a more effective exploration of the machine learning solution space. This novel approach allows SELA to discover optimal pathways based on experimental feedback, improving the overall quality of the solutions. In an extensive evaluation across 20 machine learning datasets, we compare the performance of traditional and agent-based AutoML methods, demonstrating that SELA achieves a win rate of 65% to 80% against each baseline across all datasets. These results underscore the significant potential of agent-based strategies in AutoML, offering a fresh perspective on tackling complex machine learning challenges.|Yizhou Chi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17238)|**[link](https://github.com/geekan/metagpt)**|
|**2024-10-22**|**Large Language Models Empowered Personalized Web Agents**|Web agents have emerged as a promising direction to automate Web task completion based on user instructions, significantly enhancing user experience. Recently, Web agents have evolved from traditional agents to Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Web agents. Despite their success, existing LLM-based Web agents overlook the importance of personalized data (e.g., user profiles and historical Web behaviors) in assisting the understanding of users' personalized instructions and executing customized actions. To overcome the limitation, we first formulate the task of LLM-empowered personalized Web agents, which integrate personalized data and user instructions to personalize instruction comprehension and action execution. To address the absence of a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, we construct a Personalized Web Agent Benchmark (PersonalWAB), featuring user instructions, personalized user data, Web functions, and two evaluation paradigms across three personalized Web tasks. Moreover, we propose a Personalized User Memory-enhanced Alignment (PUMA) framework to adapt LLMs to the personalized Web agent task. PUMA utilizes a memory bank with a task-specific retrieval strategy to filter relevant historical Web behaviors. Based on the behaviors, PUMA then aligns LLMs for personalized action execution through fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of PUMA over existing Web agents on PersonalWAB.|Hongru Cai et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17236)|null|

Using open-source models, our method equals or surpasses GPT-4 on a held-out set of reports.

This phenomenon poses significant risks in critical applications, such as medicine or law, necessitating robust hallucination mitigation strategies. While recent works have proposed fine-tuning methods to teach LLMs to abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge or capabilities, these methods rely on the existence of ground-truth labels or are limited to short-form responses. To address these limitations, we propose fine-tuning using semantic entropy, an uncertainty measure derived from introspection into the model which does not require external labels. We demonstrate that our approach matches or outperforms models fine-tuned using prior work and achieves strong performance for both short and long-form generations on a range of datasets.|Benedict Aaron Tjandra et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17234)|null|
|**2024-10-22**|**Few-shot In-Context Preference Learning Using Large Language Models**|Designing reward functions is a core component of reinforcement learning but can be challenging for truly complex behavior. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been used to alleviate this challenge by replacing a hand-coded reward function with a reward function learned from preferences. However, it can be exceedingly inefficient to learn these rewards as they are often learned tabula rasa. We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can reduce this query inefficiency by converting an iterative series of human preferences into code representing the rewards. We propose In-Context Preference Learning (ICPL), a method that uses the grounding of an LLM to accelerate learning reward functions from preferences. ICPL takes the environment context and task description, synthesizes a set of reward functions, and then repeatedly updates the reward functions using human rankings of videos of the resultant policies. Using synthetic preferences, we demonstrate that ICPL is orders of magnitude more efficient than RLHF and is even competitive with methods that use ground-truth reward functions instead of preferences. Finally, we perform a series of human preference-learning trials and observe that ICPL extends beyond synthetic settings and can work effectively with humans-in-the-loop.

|**2024-10-22**|**Context-aware Prompt Tuning: Advancing In-Context Learning with Adversarial Methods**|Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) typically involves updating at least a few billions of parameters. A more parameter-efficient approach is Prompt Tuning (PT), which updates only a few learnable tokens, and differently, In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts the model to a new task by simply including examples in the input without any training. When applying optimization-based methods, such as fine-tuning and PT for few-shot learning, the model is specifically adapted to the small set of training examples, whereas ICL leaves the model unchanged. This distinction makes traditional learning methods more prone to overfitting; in contrast, ICL is less sensitive to the few-shot scenario. While ICL is not prone to overfitting, it does not fully extract the information that exists in the training examples. This work introduces Context-aware Prompt Tuning (CPT), a method inspired by ICL, PT, and adversarial attacks. We build on the ICL strategy of concatenating examples before the input, but we extend this by PT-like learning, refining the context embedding through iterative optimization to extract deeper insights from the training examples. We carefully modify specific context tokens, considering the unique structure of input and output formats. Inspired by adversarial attacks, we adjust the input based on the labels present in the context, focusing on minimizing, rather than maximizing, the loss. Moreover, we apply a projected gradient descent algorithm to keep token embeddings close to their original values, under the assumption that the user-provided data is inherently valuable. Our method has been shown to achieve superior accuracy across multiple classification tasks using various LLM models.|Tsachi Blau et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17222)|null|

However, considering the essential differences between text and image modalities, the design space of language models for image generation remains underexplored. We observe that image tokens exhibit greater randomness compared to text tokens, which presents challenges when training with token prediction. Nevertheless, AR models demonstrate their potential by effectively learning patterns even from a seemingly suboptimal optimization problem. Our analysis also reveals that while all models successfully grasp the importance of local information in image generation, smaller models struggle to capture the global context. In contrast, larger models showcase improved capabilities in this area, helping to explain the performance gains achieved when scaling up model size. We further elucidate the design space of language models for vision generation, including tokenizer choice, model choice, model scalability, vocabulary design, and sampling strategy through extensive comparative experiments. Our work is the first to analyze the optimization behavior of language models in vision generation, and we believe it can inspire more effective designs when applying LMs to other domains.

Meanwhile, knowledge editing has been developed as a new popular paradigm to correct the erroneous factual knowledge encoded in LLMs with the advantage of avoiding retraining from scratch. However, one common issue of existing evaluation datasets for knowledge editing is that they do not ensure LLMs actually generate hallucinated answers to the evaluation questions before editing. When LLMs are evaluated on such datasets after being edited by different techniques, it is hard to directly adopt the performance to assess the effectiveness of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations. Thus, the fundamental question remains insufficiently validated: Can knowledge editing really correct hallucinations in LLMs? We proposed HalluEditBench to holistically benchmark knowledge editing methods in correcting real-world hallucinations. First, we rigorously construct a massive hallucination dataset with 9 domains, 26 topics and more than 6,000 hallucinations. Then, we assess the performance of knowledge editing methods in a holistic way on five dimensions including Efficacy, Generalization, Portability, Locality, and Robustness. Through HalluEditBench, we have provided new insights into the potentials and limitations of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations, which could inspire future improvements and facilitate the progress in the field of knowledge editing.|Baixiang Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16251)|**[link](https://github.com/llm-editing/HalluEditBench)**|

However, the mechanisms by which LLMs use different parts of the input context remain largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of context utilization in MT, studying how LLMs use various context parts, such as few-shot examples and the source text, when generating translations. We highlight several key findings: (1) the source part of few-shot examples appears to contribute more than its corresponding targets, irrespective of translation direction; (2) finetuning LLMs with parallel data alters the contribution patterns of different context parts; and (3) there is a positional bias where earlier few-shot examples have higher contributions to the translated sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that inspecting anomalous context contributions can potentially uncover pathological translations, such as hallucinations.

We utilize LoRA-Peft to significantly reduce trainable parameters in the LLM and incorporate recent linear attention dropping strategy in the Vision Transformer(ViT) for smoother attention. Furthermore, we provide novel multimodal attention explanations and retrieval for our model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an integrated model that combines X-ray, ECG, and Radiology/Cardiology Report with this approach. By utilizing contrastive loss, MoRE effectively aligns modality-specific features into a coherent embedding, which supports various downstream tasks such as zero-shot classification and multimodal retrieval. Employing our proposed methodology, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the Mimic-IV, CheXpert, Edema Severity, and PtbXl downstream datasets, surpassing existing multimodal approaches. Our proposed framework shows significant improvements in capturing intricate inter-modal relationships and its robustness in medical diagnosis that establishes a framework for future research in multimodal learning in the healthcare sector.|Samrajya Thapa et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16239)|**[link](https://github.com/svthapa/more)**|
|**2024-10-21**|**IBGP: Imperfect Byzantine Generals Problem for Zero-Shot Robustness in Communicative Multi-Agent Systems**|As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly integrate into our infrastructure, their robust coordination and message synchronization become vital. The Byzantine Generals Problem (BGP) is a critical model for constructing resilient multi-agent systems (MAS) under adversarial attacks. It describes a scenario where malicious agents with unknown identities exist in the system-situations that, in our context, could result from LLM agents' hallucinations or external attacks. In BGP, the objective of the entire system is to reach a consensus on the action to be taken. Traditional BGP requires global consensus among all agents; however, in practical scenarios, global consensus is not always necessary and can even be inefficient. Therefore, there is a pressing need to explore a refined version of BGP that aligns with the local coordination patterns observed in MAS. We refer to this refined version as Imperfect BGP (IBGP) in our research, aiming to address this discrepancy. To tackle this issue, we propose a framework that leverages consensus protocols within general MAS settings, providing provable resilience against communication attacks and adaptability to changing environments, as validated by empirical results. Additionally, we present a case study in a sensor network environment to illustrate the practical application of our protocol.|Yihuan Mao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16237)|null|
|**2024-10-21**|**LLaVA-KD: A Framework of Distilling Multimodal Large Language Models**|The success of Large Language Models (LLM) has led researchers to explore Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for unified visual and linguistic understanding. However, the increasing model size and computational complexity of MLLM limit their use in resource-constrained environments. Small-scale MLLM (s-MLLM) aims to retain the capabilities of the large-scale model (l-MLLM) while reducing computational demands, but resulting in a significant decline in performance. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel LLaVA-KD framework to transfer knowledge from l-MLLM to s-MLLM. Specifically, we introduce Multimodal Distillation (MDist) to minimize the divergence between the visual-textual output distributions of l-MLLM and s-MLLM, and Relation Distillation (RDist) to transfer l-MLLM's ability to model correlations between visual features. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training scheme to fully exploit the potential of s-MLLM: 1) Distilled Pre-Training to align visual-textual representations, 2) Supervised Fine-Tuning to equip the model with multimodal understanding, and 3) Distilled Fine-Tuning to further transfer l-MLLM capabilities. Our approach significantly improves performance without altering the small model's architecture. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

|**2024-10-21**|**ToW: Thoughts of Words Improve Reasoning in Large Language Models**|We introduce thoughts of words (ToW), a novel training-time data-augmentation method for next-word prediction. ToW views next-word prediction as a core reasoning task and injects fine-grained thoughts explaining what the next word should be and how it is related to the previous contexts in pre-training texts. Our formulation addresses two fundamental drawbacks of existing next-word prediction learning schemes: they induce factual hallucination and are inefficient for models to learn the implicit reasoning processes in raw texts. While there are many ways to acquire such thoughts of words, we explore the first step of acquiring ToW annotations through distilling from larger models. After continual pre-training with only 70K ToW annotations, we effectively improve models' reasoning performances by 7% to 9% on average and reduce model hallucination by up to 10%. At the same time, ToW is entirely agnostic to tasks and applications, introducing no additional biases on labels or semantics.|Zhikun Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16235)|null|
|**2024-10-18**|**Are AI Detectors Good Enough? A Survey on Quality of Datasets With Machine-Generated Texts**|The rapid development of autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved the quality of generated texts, necessitating reliable machine-generated text detectors. A huge number of detectors and collections with AI fragments have emerged, and several detection methods even showed recognition quality up to 99.9% according to the target metrics in such collections. However, the quality of such detectors tends to drop dramatically in the wild, posing a question: Are detectors actually highly trustworthy or do their high benchmark scores come from the poor quality of evaluation datasets? In this paper, we emphasise the need for robust and qualitative methods for evaluating generated data to be secure against bias and low generalising ability of future model. We present a systematic review of datasets from competitions dedicated to AI-generated content detection and propose methods for evaluating the quality of datasets containing AI-generated fragments. In addition, we discuss the possibility of using high-quality generated data to achieve two goals: improving the training of detection models and improving the training datasets themselves. Our contribution aims to facilitate a better understanding of the dynamics between human and machine text, which will ultimately support the integrity of information in an increasingly automated world.|German Gritsai et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14677)|null|

However, this part of knowledge can be useful to advanced users whose expertise qualifies them to handle these information. The one-size-fits-all alignment mechanism undermines LLM's utility for these qualified users. To address this problem, we propose SudoLM, a framework that lets LLMs learn access control over specific parametric knowledge for users with different credentials via authorization alignment. SudoLM allows authorized users to unlock their access to all the parametric knowledge with an assigned SUDO key while blocking access to non-qualified users. Experiments on two application scenarios demonstrate that SudoLM effectively controls the user's access to the parametric knowledge and maintains its general utility.|Qin Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14676)|null|
|**2024-10-18**|**Enhancing Large Language Models' Situated Faithfulness to External Contexts**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are often augmented with external information as contexts, but this external information can sometimes be inaccurate or even intentionally misleading. We argue that robust LLMs should demonstrate situated faithfulness, dynamically calibrating their trust in external information based on their confidence in the internal knowledge and the external context. To benchmark this capability, we evaluate LLMs across several QA datasets, including a newly created dataset called RedditQA featuring in-the-wild incorrect contexts sourced from Reddit posts. We show that when provided with both correct and incorrect contexts, both open-source and proprietary models tend to overly rely on external information, regardless of its factual accuracy. To enhance situated faithfulness, we propose two approaches: Self-Guided Confidence Reasoning (SCR) and Rule-Based Confidence Reasoning (RCR). SCR enables models to self-access the confidence of external information relative to their own internal knowledge to produce the most accurate answer. RCR, in contrast, extracts explicit confidence signals from the LLM and determines the final answer using predefined rules. Our results show that for LLMs with strong reasoning capabilities, such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, SCR outperforms RCR, achieving improvements of up to 24.2% over a direct input augmentation baseline. Conversely, for a smaller model like Llama-3-8B, RCR outperforms SCR. Fine-tuning SCR with our proposed Confidence Reasoning Direct Preference Optimization (CR-DPO) method improves performance on both seen and unseen datasets, yielding an average improvement of 8.9% on Llama-3-8B. In addition to quantitative results, we offer insights into the relative strengths of SCR and RCR. Our findings highlight promising avenues for improving situated faithfulness in LLMs. The data and code are released.|Yukun Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14675)|**[link](https://github.com/kkkevinkkkkk/situated_faithfulness)**|

Despite its popularity, there is a notable absence of automated methods for evaluating the quality of reasoning steps in MCoT. To address this gap, we propose Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Evaluation (MiCEval), a framework designed to assess the correctness of reasoning chains by evaluating the quality of both the description and each reasoning step. The evaluation of the description component focuses on the accuracy of the image descriptions, while the reasoning step evaluates the quality of each step as it is conditionally generated based on the preceding steps. MiCEval is built upon a fine-grained dataset with annotations that rate each step according to correctness, relevance, and informativeness. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art MLLMs show that step-wise evaluations using MiCEval align more closely with human judgments compared to existing methods based on cosine similarity or fine-tuning approaches.

|**2024-10-18**|**A Large Language Model-Driven Reward Design Framework via Dynamic Feedback for Reinforcement Learning**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in designing reward functions for Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks. However, obtaining high-quality reward code often involves human intervention, numerous LLM queries, or repetitive RL training. To address these issues, we propose CARD, a LLM-driven Reward Design framework that iteratively generates and improves reward function code. Specifically, CARD includes a Coder that generates and verifies the code, while a Evaluator provides dynamic feedback to guide the Coder in improving the code, eliminating the need for human feedback. In addition to process feedback and trajectory feedback, we introduce Trajectory Preference Evaluation (TPE), which evaluates the current reward function based on trajectory preferences. If the code fails the TPE, the Evaluator provides preference feedback, avoiding RL training at every iteration and making the reward function better aligned with the task objective. Empirical results on Meta-World and ManiSkill2 demonstrate that our method achieves an effective balance between task performance and token efficiency, outperforming or matching the baselines across all tasks. On 10 out of 12 tasks, CARD shows better or comparable performance to policies trained with expert-designed rewards, and our method even surpasses the oracle on 3 tasks.|Shengjie Sun et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14660)|null|
|**2024-10-18**|**Bridging the Training-Inference Gap in LLMs by Leveraging Self-Generated Tokens**|Language models are often trained to maximize the likelihood of the next token given past tokens in the training dataset. However, during inference time, they are utilized differently, generating text sequentially and auto-regressively by using previously generated tokens as input to predict the next one. Marginal differences in predictions at each step can cascade over successive steps, resulting in different distributions from what the models were trained for and potentially leading to unpredictable behavior. This paper proposes two simple approaches based on model own generation to address this discrepancy between the training and inference time. Our first approach is Batch-Scheduled Sampling, where, during training, we stochastically choose between the ground-truth token from the dataset and the model's own generated token as input to predict the next token. This is done in an offline manner, modifying the context window by interleaving ground-truth tokens with those generated by the model. Our second approach is Reference-Answer-based Correction, where we explicitly incorporate a self-correction capability into the model during training. This enables the model to effectively self-correct the gaps between the generated sequences and the ground truth data without relying on an external oracle model. By incorporating our proposed strategies during training, we have observed an overall improvement in performance compared to baseline methods, as demonstrated by our extensive experiments using summarization, general question-answering, and math question-answering tasks.|Zhepeng Cen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14655)|null|
|**2024-10-18**|**Real-time Fake News from Adversarial Feedback**|We show that existing evaluations for fake news detection based on conventional sources, such as claims on fact-checking websites, result in an increasing accuracy over time for LLM-based detectors -- even after their knowledge cutoffs. This suggests that recent popular political claims, which form the majority of fake news on such sources, are easily classified using surface-level shallow patterns. Instead, we argue that a proper fake news detection dataset should test a model's ability to reason factually about the current world by retrieving and reading related evidence. To this end, we develop a novel pipeline that leverages natural language feedback from a RAG-based detector to iteratively modify real-time news into deceptive fake news that challenges LLMs. Our iterative rewrite decreases the binary classification AUC by an absolute 17.5 percent for a strong RAG GPT-4o detector. Our experiments reveal the important role of RAG in both detecting and generating fake news, as retrieval-free LLM detectors are vulnerable to unseen events and adversarial attacks, while feedback from RAG detection helps discover more deceitful patterns in fake news.|Sanxing Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14651)|null|
|**2024-10-18**|**EvoPress: Towards Optimal Dynamic Model Compression via Evolutionary Search**|The high computational costs of large language models (LLMs) have led to a flurry of research on LLM compression, via methods such as quantization, sparsification, or structured pruning. A new frontier in this area is given by \emph{dynamic, non-uniform} compression methods, which adjust the compression levels (e.g., sparsity) per-block or even per-layer in order to minimize accuracy loss, while guaranteeing a global compression threshold. Yet, current methods rely on heuristics for identifying the "importance" of a given layer towards the loss, based on assumptions such as \emph{error monotonicity}, i.e. that the end-to-end model compression error is proportional to the sum of layer-wise errors. In this paper, we revisit this area, and propose a new and general approach for dynamic compression that is provably optimal in a given input range. We begin from the motivating observation that, in general, \emph{error monotonicity does not hold for LLMs}: compressed models with lower sum of per-layer errors can perform \emph{worse} than models with higher error sums. To address this, we propose a new general evolutionary framework for dynamic LLM compression called EvoPress, which has provable convergence, and low sample and evaluation complexity. We show that these theoretical guarantees lead to highly competitive practical performance for dynamic compression of Llama, Mistral and Phi models. Via EvoPress, we set new state-of-the-art results across all compression approaches: structural pruning (block/layer dropping), unstructured sparsity, as well as quantization with dynamic bitwidths.

A prominent example is the "lost in the middle" phenomenon, where LLMs struggle to utilize relevant information situated in the middle of the input. While prior research primarily focuses on single pieces of relevant information, real-world applications often involve multiple relevant information pieces. To bridge this gap, we present LongPiBench, a benchmark designed to assess positional bias involving multiple pieces of relevant information. Thorough experiments are conducted with five commercial and six open-source models. These experiments reveal that while most current models are robust against the "lost in the middle" issue, there exist significant biases related to the spacing of relevant information pieces. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating and reducing positional biases to advance LLM's capabilities.|Runchu Tian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14641)|**[link](https://github.com/Rachum-thu/LongPiBench)**|

Previous training-free embedding methods have mainly focused on optimizing embedding prompts and have overlooked the benefits of utilizing the generative abilities of LLMs. We propose a novel method, GenEOL, which uses LLMs to generate diverse transformations of a sentence that preserve its meaning, and aggregates the resulting embeddings of these transformations to enhance the overall sentence embedding. GenEOL significantly outperforms the existing training-free embedding methods by an average of 2.85 points across several LLMs on the sentence semantic text similarity (STS) benchmark. Our analysis shows that GenEOL stabilizes representation quality across LLM layers and is robust to perturbations of embedding prompts. GenEOL also achieves notable gains on multiple clustering, reranking and pair-classification tasks from the MTEB benchmark.|Raghuveer Thirukovalluru et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14635)|null|
|**2024-10-17**|**Fluid: Scaling Autoregressive Text-to-image Generative Models with Continuous Tokens**|Scaling up autoregressive models in vision has not proven as beneficial as in large language models. In this work, we investigate this scaling problem in the context of text-to-image generation, focusing on two critical factors: whether models use discrete or continuous tokens, and whether tokens are generated in a random or fixed raster order using BERT- or GPT-like transformer architectures. Our empirical results show that, while all models scale effectively in terms of validation loss, their evaluation performance -- measured by FID, GenEval score, and visual quality -- follows different trends. Models based on continuous tokens achieve significantly better visual quality than those using discrete tokens. Furthermore, the generation order and attention mechanisms significantly affect the GenEval score: random-order models achieve notably better GenEval scores compared to raster-order models. Inspired by these findings, we train Fluid, a random-order autoregressive model on continuous tokens. Fluid 10.5B model achieves a new state-of-the-art zero-shot FID of 6.16 on MS-COCO 30K, and 0.69 overall score on the GenEval benchmark. We hope our findings and results will encourage future efforts to further bridge the scaling gap between vision and language models.|Lijie Fan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13863)|null|

Initial attempts have also explored the potential of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for visual content generation. However, existing works have insufficiently addressed the varying granularity demands of different image generation tasks within a unified MLLM paradigm - from the diversity required in text-to-image generation to the precise controllability needed in image manipulation.

Traditional methods depending on supervised learning with 3D point clouds are limited by scarce datasets. Recently zero-shot methods leveraging LLMs have been proposed to address the data issue. While effective, these methods only use object-centric information, limiting their ability to handle complex queries. In this work, we present VLM-Grounder, a novel framework using vision-language models (VLMs) for zero-shot 3D visual grounding based solely on 2D images. VLM-Grounder dynamically stitches image sequences, employs a grounding and feedback scheme to find the target object, and uses a multi-view ensemble projection to accurately estimate 3D bounding boxes. Experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets show VLM-Grounder outperforms previous zero-shot methods, achieving 51.6% Acc@0.25 on ScanRefer and 48.0% Acc on Nr3D, without relying on 3D geometry or object priors.

|**2024-10-17**|**$γ-$MoD: Exploring Mixture-of-Depth Adaptation for Multimodal Large Language Models**|Despite the significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their high computational cost remains a barrier to real-world deployment. Inspired by the mixture of depths (MoDs) in natural language processing, we aim to address this limitation from the perspective of ``activated tokens''. Our key insight is that if most tokens are redundant for the layer computation, then can be skipped directly via the MoD layer. However, directly converting the dense layers of MLLMs to MoD layers leads to substantial performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose an innovative MoD adaptation strategy for existing MLLMs called $\gamma$-MoD. In $\gamma$-MoD, a novel metric is proposed to guide the deployment of MoDs in the MLLM, namely rank of attention maps (ARank). Through ARank, we can effectively identify which layer is redundant and should be replaced with the MoD layer. Based on ARank, we further propose two novel designs to maximize the computational sparsity of MLLM while maintaining its performance, namely shared vision-language router and masked routing learning. With these designs, more than 90% dense layers of the MLLM can be effectively converted to the MoD ones. To validate our method, we apply it to three popular MLLMs, and conduct extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets. Experimental results not only validate the significant efficiency benefit of $\gamma$-MoD to existing MLLMs but also confirm its generalization ability on various MLLMs. For example, with a minor performance drop, i.e., -1.5%, $\gamma$ -MoD can reduce the training and inference time of LLaVA-HR by 31.0% and 53.2%, respectively.|Yaxin Luo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13859)|null|

In this paper, we conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis of LLMs' mathematical abilities, with a specific focus on their arithmetic performances. We identify numerical precision as a key factor that influences their effectiveness in mathematical tasks. Our results show that Transformers operating with low numerical precision fail to address arithmetic tasks, such as iterated addition and integer multiplication, unless the model size grows super-polynomially with respect to the input length. In contrast, Transformers with standard numerical precision can efficiently handle these tasks with significantly smaller model sizes. We further support our theoretical findings through empirical experiments that explore the impact of varying numerical precision on arithmetic tasks, providing valuable insights for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs.|Guhao Feng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13857)|null|
|**2024-10-17**|**Can MLLMs Understand the Deep Implication Behind Chinese Images?**|As the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to improve, the need for higher-order capability evaluation of MLLMs is increasing. However, there is a lack of work evaluating MLLM for higher-order perception and understanding of Chinese visual content. To fill the gap, we introduce the **C**hinese **I**mage **I**mplication understanding **Bench**mark, **CII-Bench**, which aims to assess the higher-order perception and understanding capabilities of MLLMs for Chinese images. CII-Bench stands out in several ways compared to existing benchmarks. Firstly, to ensure the authenticity of the Chinese context, images in CII-Bench are sourced from the Chinese Internet and manually reviewed, with corresponding answers also manually crafted. Additionally, CII-Bench incorporates images that represent Chinese traditional culture, such as famous Chinese traditional paintings, which can deeply reflect the model's understanding of Chinese traditional culture. Through extensive experiments on CII-Bench across multiple MLLMs, we have made significant findings. Initially, a substantial gap is observed between the performance of MLLMs and humans on CII-Bench. The highest accuracy of MLLMs attains 64.4%, where as human accuracy averages 78.2%, peaking at an impressive 81.0%. Subsequently, MLLMs perform worse on Chinese traditional culture images, suggesting limitations in their ability to understand high-level semantics and lack a deep knowledge base of Chinese traditional culture. Finally, it is observed that most models exhibit enhanced accuracy when image emotion hints are incorporated into the prompts. We believe that CII-Bench will enable MLLMs to gain a better understanding of Chinese semantics and Chinese-specific images, advancing the journey towards expert artificial general intelligence (AGI).

|**2024-10-17**|**Retrospective Learning from Interactions**|Multi-turn interactions between large language models (LLMs) and users naturally include implicit feedback signals. If an LLM responds in an unexpected way to an instruction, the user is likely to signal it by rephrasing the request, expressing frustration, or pivoting to an alternative task. Such signals are task-independent and occupy a relatively constrained subspace of language, allowing the LLM to identify them even if it fails on the actual task. This creates an avenue for continually learning from interactions without additional annotations. We introduce ReSpect, a method to learn from such signals in past interactions via retrospection. We deploy ReSpect in a new multimodal interaction scenario, where humans instruct an LLM to solve an abstract reasoning task with a combinatorial solution space. Through thousands of interactions with humans, we show how ReSpect gradually improves task completion rate from 31% to 82%, all without any external annotation.|Zizhao Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13852)|null|
|**2024-10-17**|**SimLayerKV: A Simple Framework for Layer-Level KV Cache Reduction**|Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their capabilities to handle long contexts. However, increasing the number of model layers and the length of input sequences significantly escalates the memory required to store key-value (KV) cache, posing challenges for efficient inference. To mitigate this issue, we present SimLayerKV, a simple yet effective method that reduces inter-layer KV cache redundancies by selectively dropping cache in identified lazy layers. Our approach is based on the observation that certain layers in long-context LLMs exhibit "lazy" behavior, contributing less to modeling long-range dependencies compared to non-lazy layers. By analyzing attention weight patterns, we find that the behavior of these lazy layers is consistent across tokens during generation for a given input. This insight motivates our SimLayerKV, which identifies lazy layers and reduces their KV cache accordingly. SimLayerKV is training-free, generalizable, and can be implemented with only seven lines of code. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative LLMs, e.g., LLaMA2-7B, LLaMA3-8B, and Mistral-7B across 16 tasks from the LongBench benchmark. The results demonstrate that SimLayerKV achieves a KV cache compression ratio of 5 $\times$ with only a 1.2% performance drop when combined with 4-bit quantization.

|**2024-10-17**|**Active-Dormant Attention Heads: Mechanistically Demystifying Extreme-Token Phenomena in LLMs**|Practitioners have consistently observed three puzzling phenomena in transformer-based large language models (LLMs): attention sinks, value-state drains, and residual-state peaks, collectively referred to as extreme-token phenomena. These phenomena are characterized by certain so-called "sink tokens" receiving disproportionately high attention weights, exhibiting significantly smaller value states, and having much larger residual-state norms than those of other tokens. These extreme tokens give rise to various challenges in LLM inference, quantization, and interpretability.   We elucidate the mechanisms behind extreme-token phenomena. First, we show that these phenomena arise in very simple architectures -- transformers with one to three layers -- trained on a toy model, the Bigram-Backcopy (BB) task. In this setting, we identify an active-dormant mechanism, where attention heads become sinks for specific input domains while remaining non-sinks for others. Our theoretical analysis of the training dynamics reveals that these phenomena are driven by a mutual reinforcement mechanism. Building on these insights, we propose strategies to mitigate extreme-token phenomena during pretraining, including replacing softmax with ReLU and Adam with SGD. Next, we extend our analysis to pretrained LLMs, including Llama and OLMo, showing that many attention heads exhibit a similar active-dormant mechanism as in the BB task, and that the mutual reinforcement mechanism also governs the emergence of extreme-token phenomena during LLM pretraining. Our results reveal that many of the static and dynamic properties of extreme-token phenomena predicted by the BB task align with observations in pretrained LLMs.|Tianyu Guo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13835)|null|

Automating web tasks (like booking hotels within a budget) is increasingly sought after. Fulfilling practical needs, the web agent also serves as an important proof-of-concept example for various agent grounding scenarios, with its success promising advancements in many future applications. Prior research often handcrafts web agent strategies (e.g., prompting templates, multi-agent systems, search methods, etc.) and the corresponding in-context examples, which may not generalize well across all real-world scenarios. On the other hand, there has been limited study on the misalignment between a web agent's observation/action representation and the pre-training data of the LLM it's based on. This discrepancy is especially notable when LLMs are primarily trained for language completion rather than tasks involving embodied navigation actions and symbolic web elements. Our study enhances an LLM-based web agent by simply refining its observation and action space to better align with the LLM's capabilities. This approach enables our base agent to significantly outperform previous methods on a wide variety of web tasks. Specifically, on WebArena, a benchmark featuring general-purpose web interaction tasks, our agent AgentOccam surpasses the previous state-of-the-art and concurrent work by 9.8 (+29.4%) and 5.9 (+15.8%) absolute points respectively, and boosts the success rate by 26.6 points (+161%) over similar plain web agents with its observation and action space alignment. We achieve this without using in-context examples, new agent roles, online feedback or search strategies. AgentOccam's simple design highlights LLMs' impressive zero-shot performance on web tasks, and underlines the critical role of carefully tuning observation and action spaces for LLM-based agents.|Ke Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13825)|null|
|**2024-10-16**|**Meta-Chunking: Learning Efficient Text Segmentation via Logical Perception**|Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while serving as a viable complement to large language models (LLMs), often overlooks the crucial aspect of text chunking within its pipeline, which impacts the quality of knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper introduces the concept of Meta-Chunking, which refers to a granularity between sentences and paragraphs, consisting of a collection of sentences within a paragraph that have deep linguistic logical connections. To implement Meta-Chunking, we designed two strategies based on LLMs: Margin Sampling Chunking and Perplexity Chunking. The former employs LLMs to perform binary classification on whether consecutive sentences need to be segmented, making decisions based on the probability difference obtained from margin sampling. The latter precisely identifies text chunk boundaries by analyzing the characteristics of perplexity distribution. Additionally, considering the inherent complexity of different texts, we propose a strategy that combines Meta-Chunking with dynamic merging to achieve a balance between fine-grained and coarse-grained text chunking. Experiments conducted on eleven datasets demonstrate that Meta-Chunking can more efficiently improve the performance of single-hop and multi-hop question answering based on RAG. For instance, on the 2WikiMultihopQA dataset, it outperforms similarity chunking by 1.32 while only consuming 45.8% of the time.

|**2024-10-16**|**JudgeBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM-based Judges**|LLM-based judges have emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation and are increasingly used to assess, compare, and improve models. However, the reliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs become more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring stronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a judge's alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more challenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of factual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we propose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging response pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench leverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into challenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges, fine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench poses a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many strong models (e.g., GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random guessing. Overall, JudgeBench offers a reliable platform for assessing increasingly advanced LLM-based judges.

However, leveraging the ICL capabilities within LLMs to directly predict robot actions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RoboPrompt, a framework that enables off-the-shelf text-only LLMs to directly predict robot actions through ICL without training. Our approach first heuristically identifies keyframes that capture important moments from an episode. Next, we extract end-effector actions from these keyframes as well as the estimated initial object poses, and both are converted into textual descriptions. Finally, we construct a structured template to form ICL demonstrations from these textual descriptions and a task instruction. This enables an LLM to directly predict robot actions at test time. Through extensive experiments and analysis, RoboPrompt shows stronger performance over zero-shot and ICL baselines in simulated and real-world settings.|Yida Yin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12782)|null|
|**2024-10-16**|**Identifying Task Groupings for Multi-Task Learning Using Pointwise V-Usable Information**|The success of multi-task learning can depend heavily on which tasks are grouped together. Naively grouping all tasks or a random set of tasks can result in negative transfer, with the multi-task models performing worse than single-task models. Though many efforts have been made to identify task groupings and to measure the relatedness among different tasks, it remains a challenging research topic to define a metric to identify the best task grouping out of a pool of many potential task combinations. We propose a metric of task relatedness based on task difficulty measured by pointwise V-usable information (PVI). PVI is a recently proposed metric to estimate how much usable information a dataset contains given a model. We hypothesize that tasks with not statistically different PVI estimates are similar enough to benefit from the joint learning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the feasibility of this metric for task grouping on 15 NLP datasets in the general, biomedical, and clinical domains. We compare the results of the joint learners against single learners, existing baseline methods, and recent large language models, including Llama 2 and GPT-4. The results show that by grouping tasks with similar PVI estimates, the joint learners yielded competitive results with fewer total parameters, with consistent performance across domains.|Yingya Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12774)|null|
|**2024-10-16**|**StyleDistance: Stronger Content-Independent Style Embeddings with Synthetic Parallel Examples**|Style representations aim to embed texts with similar writing styles closely and texts with different styles far apart, regardless of content. However, the contrastive triplets often used for training these representations may vary in both style and content, leading to potential content leakage in the representations. We introduce StyleDistance, a novel approach to training stronger content-independent style embeddings. We use a large language model to create a synthetic dataset of near-exact paraphrases with controlled style variations, and produce positive and negative examples across 40 distinct style features for precise contrastive learning. We assess the quality of our synthetic data and embeddings through human and automatic evaluations. StyleDistance enhances the content-independence of style embeddings, which generalize to real-world benchmarks and outperform leading style representations in downstream applications.

|**2024-10-17**|**CREAM: Consistency Regularized Self-Rewarding Language Models**|Recent self-rewarding large language models (LLM) have successfully applied LLM-as-a-Judge to iteratively improve the alignment performance without the need of human annotations for preference data. These methods commonly utilize the same LLM to act as both the policy model (which generates responses) and the reward model (which scores and ranks those responses). The ranked responses are then used as preference pairs to train the LLM via direct alignment technologies (e.g. DPO). However, it is noteworthy that throughout this process, there is no guarantee of accuracy in the rewarding and ranking, which is critical for ensuring accurate rewards and high-quality preference data. Empirical results from relatively small LLMs (e.g., 7B parameters) also indicate that improvements from self-rewarding may diminish after several iterations in certain situations, which we hypothesize is due to accumulated bias in the reward system. This bias can lead to unreliable preference data for training the LLM. To address this issue, we first formulate and analyze the generalized iterative preference fine-tuning framework for self-rewarding language model. We then introduce the regularization to this generalized framework to mitigate the overconfident preference labeling in the self-rewarding process. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose a Consistency Regularized sElf-rewarding lAnguage Model (CREAM) that leverages the rewarding consistency across different iterations to regularize the self-rewarding training, helping the model to learn from more reliable preference data. With this explicit regularization, our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of CREAM in improving both reward consistency and alignment performance.

|**2024-10-16**|**FusionLLM: A Decentralized LLM Training System on Geo-distributed GPUs with Adaptive Compression**|To alleviate hardware scarcity in training large deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly large language models (LLMs), we present FusionLLM, a decentralized training system designed and implemented for training DNNs using geo-distributed GPUs across different computing clusters or individual devices. Decentralized training faces significant challenges regarding system design and efficiency, including: 1) the need for remote automatic differentiation (RAD), 2) support for flexible model definitions and heterogeneous software, 3) heterogeneous hardware leading to low resource utilization or the straggler problem, and 4) slow network communication. To address these challenges, in the system design, we represent the model as a directed acyclic graph of operators (OP-DAG). Each node in the DAG represents the operator in the DNNs, while the edge represents the data dependency between operators. Based on this design, 1) users are allowed to customize any DNN without caring low-level operator implementation; 2) we enable the task scheduling with the more fine-grained sub-tasks, offering more optimization space; 3) a DAG runtime executor can implement RAD withour requiring the consistent low-level ML framework versions.   To enhance system efficiency, we implement a workload estimator and design an OP-Fence scheduler to cluster devices with similar bandwidths together and partition the DAG to increase throughput. Additionally, we propose an AdaTopK compressor to adaptively compress intermediate activations and gradients at the slowest communication links. To evaluate the convergence and efficiency of our system and algorithms, we train ResNet-101 and GPT-2 on three real-world testbeds using 48 GPUs connected with 8 Mbps~10 Gbps networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our system and method can achieve 1.45 - 9.39x speedup compared to baseline methods while ensuring convergence.|Zhenheng Tang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12707)|null|
|**2024-10-16**|**Embedding an Ethical Mind: Aligning Text-to-Image Synthesis via Lightweight Value Optimization**|Recent advancements in diffusion models trained on large-scale data have enabled the generation of indistinguishable human-level images, yet they often produce harmful content misaligned with human values, e.g., social bias, and offensive content. Despite extensive research on Large Language Models (LLMs), the challenge of Text-to-Image (T2I) model alignment remains largely unexplored. Addressing this problem, we propose LiVO (Lightweight Value Optimization), a novel lightweight method for aligning T2I models with human values. LiVO only optimizes a plug-and-play value encoder to integrate a specified value principle with the input prompt, allowing the control of generated images over both semantics and values. Specifically, we design a diffusion model-tailored preference optimization loss, which theoretically approximates the Bradley-Terry model used in LLM alignment but provides a more flexible trade-off between image quality and value conformity. To optimize the value encoder, we also develop a framework to automatically construct a text-image preference dataset of 86k (prompt, aligned image, violating image, value principle) samples. Without updating most model parameters and through adaptive value selection from the input prompt, LiVO significantly reduces harmful outputs and achieves faster convergence, surpassing several strong baselines and taking an initial step towards ethically aligned T2I models.|Xingqi Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12700)|**[link](https://github.com/achernarwang/LiVO)**|

Modern large language models (LLMs), like Llama-2, offer promise for automating the mapping of these landmarks in free-text radiology reports to corresponding positions in image data. Recent studies propose LLMs may develop coherent representations of generative processes. Motivated by these insights, we investigated whether LLMs accurately represent the spatial positions of anatomical landmarks. Through experiments with Llama-2 models, we found that they can linearly represent anatomical landmarks in space with considerable robustness to different prompts. These results underscore the potential of LLMs to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of medical imaging workflows.|Mohamad Abdi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12686)|null|
|**2024-10-16**|**Cross-Modal Safety Mechanism Transfer in Large Vision-Language Models**|Vision-language alignment in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) successfully enables LLMs to understand visual input. However, we find that existing vision-language alignment methods fail to transfer the existing safety mechanism for text in LLMs to vision, which leads to vulnerabilities in toxic image. To explore the cause of this problem, we give the insightful explanation of where and how the safety mechanism of LVLMs operates and conduct comparative analysis between text and vision. We find that the hidden states at the specific transformer layers play a crucial role in the successful activation of safety mechanism, while the vision-language alignment at hidden states level in current methods is insufficient. This results in a semantic shift for input images compared to text in hidden states, therefore misleads the safety mechanism. To address this, we propose a novel Text-Guided vision-language Alignment method (TGA) for LVLMs. TGA retrieves the texts related to input vision and uses them to guide the projection of vision into the hidden states space in LLMs. Experiments show that TGA not only successfully transfers the safety mechanism for text in basic LLMs to vision in vision-language alignment for LVLMs without any safety fine-tuning on the visual modality but also maintains the general performance on various vision tasks (Safe and Good).|Shicheng Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12662)|null|
|**2024-10-15**|**MoH: Multi-Head Attention as Mixture-of-Head Attention**|In this work, we upgrade the multi-head attention mechanism, the core of the Transformer model, to improve efficiency while maintaining or surpassing the previous accuracy level. We show that multi-head attention can be expressed in the summation form. Drawing on the insight that not all attention heads hold equal significance, we propose Mixture-of-Head attention (MoH), a new architecture that treats attention heads as experts in the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism. MoH has two significant advantages: First, MoH enables each token to select the appropriate attention heads, enhancing inference efficiency without compromising accuracy or increasing the number of parameters. Second, MoH replaces the standard summation in multi-head attention with a weighted summation, introducing flexibility to the attention mechanism and unlocking extra performance potential. Extensive experiments on ViT, DiT, and LLMs demonstrate that MoH outperforms multi-head attention by using only 50%-90% of the attention heads. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-trained multi-head attention models, such as LLaMA3-8B, can be further continue-tuned into our MoH models. Notably, MoH-LLaMA3-8B achieves an average accuracy of 64.0% across 14 benchmarks, outperforming LLaMA3-8B by 2.4% by utilizing only 75% of the attention heads. We believe the proposed MoH is a promising alternative to multi-head attention and provides a strong foundation for developing advanced and efficient attention-based models.|Peng Jin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11842)|**[link](https://github.com/skyworkai/moh)**|
|**2024-10-15**|**GaVaMoE: Gaussian-Variational Gated Mixture of Experts for Explainable Recommendation**|Large language model-based explainable recommendation (LLM-based ER) systems show promise in generating human-like explanations for recommendations. However, they face challenges in modeling user-item collaborative preferences, personalizing explanations, and handling sparse user-item interactions. To address these issues, we propose GaVaMoE, a novel Gaussian-Variational Gated Mixture of Experts framework for explainable recommendation. GaVaMoE introduces two key components: (1) a rating reconstruction module that employs Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to capture complex user-item collaborative preferences, serving as a pre-trained multi-gating mechanism; and (2) a set of fine-grained expert models coupled with the multi-gating mechanism for generating highly personalized explanations. The VAE component models latent factors in user-item interactions, while the GMM clusters users with similar behaviors. Each cluster corresponds to a gate in the multi-gating mechanism, routing user-item pairs to appropriate expert models. This architecture enables GaVaMoE to generate tailored explanations for specific user types and preferences, mitigating data sparsity by leveraging user similarities. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GaVaMoE significantly outperforms existing methods in explanation quality, personalization, and consistency. Notably, GaVaMoE exhibits robust performance in scenarios with sparse user-item interactions, maintaining high-quality explanations even for users with limited historical data.|Fei Tang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11841)|null|

Previous methods integrating multiple vision encoders to enhance visual detail introduce redundancy and computational overhead. We observe that most MLLMs utilize only the last-layer feature map of the vision encoder for visual representation, neglecting the rich fine-grained information in shallow feature maps. To address this issue, we propose \modelname, a simple yet effective multi-layer feature fuser that efficiently integrates deep and shallow features from Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, it leverages semantically aligned deep features as queries to dynamically extract missing details from shallow features, thus preserving semantic alignment while enriching the representation with fine-grained information. Applied to the LLaVA-1.5 model, \modelname~achieves significant improvements in visual representation and benchmark performance, providing a more flexible and lightweight solution compared to multi-encoder ensemble methods.

It can serve as a natural interface for image editing, dramatically improving precision and flexibility. Leveraging this benefit, we introduce a new framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with Text2Image generative model for scene graph-based image editing. This integration enables precise modifications at the object level and creative recomposition of scenes without compromising overall image integrity. Our approach involves two primary stages: 1) Utilizing a LLM-driven scene parser, we construct an image's scene graph, capturing key objects and their interrelationships, as well as parsing fine-grained attributes such as object masks and descriptions. These annotations facilitate concept learning with a fine-tuned diffusion model, representing each object with an optimized token and detailed description prompt. 2) During the image editing phase, a LLM editing controller guides the edits towards specific areas. These edits are then implemented by an attention-modulated diffusion editor, utilizing the fine-tuned model to perform object additions, deletions, replacements, and adjustments. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing image editing methods in terms of editing precision and scene aesthetics.|Zhiyuan Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11815)|null|

During tool learning, LLMs may call multiple tools in nested orders, where the latter tool call may take the former response as its input parameters. However, current research on the nested tool learning capabilities is still under-explored, since the existing benchmarks lack of relevant data instances. To address this problem, we introduce NesTools to bridge the current gap in comprehensive nested tool learning evaluations. NesTools comprises a novel automatic data generation method to construct large-scale nested tool calls with different nesting structures. With manual review and refinement, the dataset is in high quality and closely aligned with real-world scenarios. Therefore, NesTools can serve as a new benchmark to evaluate the nested tool learning abilities of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on 22 LLMs, and provide in-depth analyses with NesTools, which shows that current LLMs still suffer from the complex nested tool learning task.|Han Han et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11805)|null|

While TSF methods are emerging these days, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and struggle with poor generalization performance on new domains. Foundation models aim to overcome this limitation. Pre-trained on large-scale language or time series data, they exhibit promising inferencing capabilities in new or unseen data. This has spurred a surge in new TSF foundation models. We propose a new benchmark, FoundTS, to enable thorough and fair evaluation and comparison of such models. FoundTS covers a variety of TSF foundation models, including those based on large language models and those pretrained on time series. Next, FoundTS supports different forecasting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, thereby facilitating more thorough evaluations. Finally, FoundTS offers a pipeline that standardizes evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, thereby facilitating fair evaluations. Building on this, we report on an extensive evaluation of TSF foundation models on a broad range of datasets from diverse domains and with different statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing foundation models, and we identify directions for future model design.

To mitigate the additional computational and financial costs associated with in-context learning, several prompt compression methods have been proposed to compress the in-context learning prompts. Despite their success, these methods face challenges with transferability due to model-specific compression, or rely on external training data, such as GPT-4. In this paper, we investigate the ability of LLMs to develop a unified compression method that discretizes uninformative tokens, utilizing a self-supervised pre-training technique. By introducing a small number of parameters during the continual pre-training, the proposed Selection-p produces a probability for each input token, indicating whether to preserve or discard it. Experiments show Selection-p achieves state-of-the-art performance across numerous classification tasks, achieving compression rates of up to 10 times while experiencing only a marginal 0.8% decrease in performance. Moreover, it exhibits superior transferability to different models compared to prior work. Additionally, we further analyze how Selection-p helps maintain performance on in-context learning with long contexts.|Tsz Ting Chung et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11786)|null|

Despite the diverse and high-performing designs available, practitioners often face confusion when selecting the most effective pipeline for their specific task: \textit{Which topology is the best choice for my task, avoiding unnecessary communication token overhead while ensuring high-quality solution?} In response to this dilemma, we introduce G-Designer, an adaptive, efficient, and robust solution for multi-agent deployment, which dynamically designs task-aware, customized communication topologies. Specifically, G-Designer models the multi-agent system as a multi-agent network, leveraging a variational graph auto-encoder to encode both the nodes (agents) and a task-specific virtual node, and decodes a task-adaptive and high-performing communication topology. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks showcase that G-Designer is: \textbf{(1) high-performing}, achieving superior results on MMLU with accuracy at $84.50\%$ and on HumanEval with pass@1 at $89.90\%$; \textbf{(2) task-adaptive}, architecting communication protocols tailored to task difficulty, reducing token consumption by up to $95.33\%$ on HumanEval; and \textbf{(3) adversarially robust}, defending against agent adversarial attacks with merely $0.3\%$ accuracy drop.|Guibin Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11782)|null|

A natural hypothesis is that these errors stem from how LLMs represent numbers, and specifically, whether their representations of numbers capture their numeric values. We tackle this question from the observation that LLM errors on numerical tasks are often distributed across \textit{the digits} of the answer rather than normally around \textit{its numeric value}. Through a series of probing experiments and causal interventions, we show that LLMs internally represent numbers with individual circular representations per-digit in base 10. This digit-wise representation, as opposed to a value representation, sheds light on the error patterns of models on tasks involving numerical reasoning and could serve as a basis for future studies on analyzing numerical mechanisms in LLMs.|Amit Arnold Levy et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11781)|null|
|**2024-10-15**|**MLLM can see? Dynamic Correction Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation**|Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, but the underlying reasons remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis and find that, although MLLMs incorrectly generate the objects in the final output, they are actually able to recognize visual objects in the preceding layers. We speculate that this may be due to the strong knowledge priors of the language model suppressing the visual information, leading to hallucinations. Motivated by this, we propose a novel dynamic correction decoding method for MLLMs (DeCo), which adaptively selects the appropriate preceding layers and proportionally integrates knowledge into the final layer to adjust the output logits. Note that DeCo is model agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated with various classic decoding strategies and applied to different MLLMs. We evaluate DeCo on widely-used benchmarks, demonstrating that it can reduce hallucination rates by a large margin compared to baselines, highlighting its potential to mitigate hallucinations.

|**2024-10-14**|**DuoAttention: Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference with Retrieval and Streaming Heads**|Deploying long-context large language models (LLMs) is essential but poses significant computational and memory challenges. Caching all Key and Value (KV) states across all attention heads consumes substantial memory. Existing KV cache pruning methods either damage the long-context capabilities of LLMs or offer only limited efficiency improvements. In this paper, we identify that only a fraction of attention heads, a.k.a, Retrieval Heads, are critical for processing long contexts and require full attention across all tokens. In contrast, all other heads, which primarily focus on recent tokens and attention sinks--referred to as Streaming Heads--do not require full attention. Based on this insight, we introduce DuoAttention, a framework that only applies a full KV cache to retrieval heads while using a light-weight, constant-length KV cache for streaming heads, which reduces both LLM's decoding and pre-filling memory and latency without compromising its long-context abilities. DuoAttention uses a lightweight, optimization-based algorithm with synthetic data to identify retrieval heads accurately. Our method significantly reduces long-context inference memory by up to 2.55x for MHA and 1.67x for GQA models while speeding up decoding by up to 2.18x and 1.50x and accelerating pre-filling by up to 1.73x and 1.63x for MHA and GQA models, respectively, with minimal accuracy loss compared to full attention. Notably, combined with quantization, DuoAttention enables Llama-3-8B decoding with 3.3 million context length on a single A100 GPU.

Due to the lack of fine-grained temporal annotations, existing video benchmarks mostly resemble static image benchmarks and are incompetent at evaluating models for temporal understanding. In this paper, we introduce TemporalBench, a new benchmark dedicated to evaluating fine-grained temporal understanding in videos. TemporalBench consists of ~10K video question-answer pairs, derived from ~2K high-quality human annotations detailing the temporal dynamics in video clips. As a result, our benchmark provides a unique testbed for evaluating various temporal understanding and reasoning abilities such as action frequency, motion magnitude, event order, etc. Moreover, it enables evaluations on various tasks like both video question answering and captioning, both short and long video understanding, as well as different models such as multimodal video embedding models and text generation models. Results show that state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o achieve only 38.5% question answering accuracy on TemporalBench, demonstrating a significant gap (~30%) between humans and AI in temporal understanding. Furthermore, we notice a critical pitfall for multi-choice QA where LLMs can detect the subtle changes in negative captions and find a centralized description as a cue for its prediction, where we propose Multiple Binary Accuracy (MBA) to correct such bias. We hope that TemporalBench can foster research on improving models' temporal reasoning capabilities.

Does this contradict their claim of generalists? To answer the question, we take a closer look at Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs. Our study shows that the expert routers in MoE LLMs can serve as an off-the-shelf embedding model with promising performance on a diverse class of embedding-focused tasks, without requiring any finetuning. Moreover, our extensive analysis shows that the MoE routing weights (RW) is complementary to the hidden state (HS) of LLMs, a widely-used embedding. Compared to HS, we find that RW is more robust to the choice of prompts and focuses on high-level semantics. Motivated by the analysis, we propose MoEE combining RW and HS, which achieves better performance than using either separately. Our exploration of their combination and prompting strategy shed several novel insights, e.g., a weighted sum of RW and HS similarities outperforms the similarity on their concatenation. Our experiments are conducted on 6 embedding tasks with 20 datasets from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). The results demonstrate the significant improvement brought by MoEE to LLM-based embedding without further finetuning.|Ziyue Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10814)|null|

This paper introduces LongMemEval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate five core long-term memory abilities of chat assistants: information extraction, multi-session reasoning, temporal reasoning, knowledge updates, and abstention. With 500 meticulously curated questions embedded within freely scalable user-assistant chat histories, LongMemEval presents a significant challenge to existing long-term memory systems, with commercial chat assistants and long-context LLMs showing 30% accuracy drop on memorizing information across sustained interactions. We then present a unified framework that breaks down the long-term memory design into four design choices across the indexing, retrieval, and reading stages. Built upon key experimental insights, we propose several memory designs including session decomposition for optimizing value granularity, fact-augmented key expansion for enhancing the index structure, and time-aware query expansion for refining the search scope. Experiment results show that these optimizations greatly improve both memory recall and downstream question answering on LongMemEval. Overall, our study provides valuable resources and guidance for advancing the long-term memory capabilities of LLM-based chat assistants, paving the way toward more personalized and reliable conversational AI.|Di Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813)|**[link](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/longmemeval)**|

However, ensuring their safe use remains a significant challenge. Preference training and safety measures often overfit to harms prevalent in Western-centric datasets, and safety protocols frequently fail to extend to multilingual settings. In this work, we explore model merging in a diverse multi-task setting, combining safety and general-purpose tasks within a multilingual context. Each language introduces unique and varied learning challenges across tasks. We find that objective-based merging is more effective than mixing data, with improvements of up to 8% and 10% in general performance and safety respectively. We also find that language-based merging is highly effective -- by merging monolingually fine-tuned models, we achieve a 4% increase in general performance and 7% reduction in harm across all languages on top of the data mixtures method using the same available data. Overall, our comprehensive study of merging approaches provides a useful framework for building strong and safe multilingual models.|Aakanksha et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10801)|null|
|**2024-10-15**|**MMAR: Towards Lossless Multi-Modal Auto-Regressive Probabilistic Modeling**|Recent advancements in multi-modal large language models have propelled the development of joint probabilistic models capable of both image understanding and generation. However, we have identified that recent methods inevitably suffer from loss of image information during understanding task, due to either image discretization or diffusion denoising steps. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Auto-Regressive (MMAR) probabilistic modeling framework. Unlike discretization line of method, MMAR takes in continuous-valued image tokens to avoid information loss. Differing from diffusion-based approaches, we disentangle the diffusion process from auto-regressive backbone model by employing a light-weight diffusion head on top each auto-regressed image patch embedding. In this way, when the model transits from image generation to understanding through text generation, the backbone model's hidden representation of the image is not limited to the last denoising step. To successfully train our method, we also propose a theoretically proven technique that addresses the numerical stability issue and a training strategy that balances the generation and understanding task goals. Through extensive evaluations on 18 image understanding benchmarks, MMAR demonstrates much more superior performance than other joint multi-modal models, matching the method that employs pretrained CLIP vision encoder, meanwhile being able to generate high quality images at the same time. We also showed that our method is scalable with larger data and model size.|Jian Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10798)|null|
|**2024-10-14**|**Context-Parametric Inversion: Why Instruction Finetuning May Not Actually Improve Context Reliance**|Large language models are instruction-finetuned to enhance their ability to follow user instructions and process the input context. However, even state-of-the-art models often struggle to follow the instruction, especially when the input context is not aligned with the model's parametric knowledge. This manifests as various failures, such as hallucinations where the responses are outdated, biased or contain unverified facts. In this work, we try to understand the underlying reason for this poor context reliance, especially after instruction tuning. We observe an intriguing phenomenon: during instruction tuning, the context reliance initially increases as expected, but then gradually decreases as instruction finetuning progresses. We call this phenomenon context-parametric inversion and observe it across multiple general purpose instruction tuning datasets like TULU, Alpaca and Ultrachat, as well as model families such as Llama, Mistral and Pythia. In a simple theoretical setup, we isolate why context-parametric inversion occurs along the gradient descent trajectory of instruction finetuning. We tie this phenomena to examples in the instruction finetuning data mixture where the input context provides information that is already present in the model's parametric knowledge. Our analysis suggests natural mitigation strategies that provide some limited gains, while also validating our theoretical insights. We hope that our work serves as a starting point in addressing this failure mode in a staple part of LLM training.|Sachin Goyal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10796)|**[link](https://github.com/locuslab/context-parametric-inversion)**|

However, despite its effectiveness in tackling complex tasks, ReAct faces two main challenges: losing focus on the original question and becoming stuck in action loops. To address these issues, we introduce Focused ReAct, an enhanced version of the ReAct paradigm that incorporates reiteration and early stop mechanisms. These improvements help the model stay focused on the original query and avoid repetitive behaviors. Experimental results show accuracy gains of 18% to 530% and a runtime reduction of up to 34% compared to the original ReAct method.|Shuoqiu Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10779)|null|
|**2024-10-14**|**AFlow: Automating Agentic Workflow Generation**|Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in solving complex tasks across diverse domains, typically by employing agentic workflows that follow detailed instructions and operational sequences. However, constructing these workflows requires significant human effort, limiting scalability and generalizability. Recent research has sought to automate the generation and optimization of these workflows, but existing methods still rely on initial manual setup and fall short of achieving fully automated and effective workflow generation. To address this challenge, we reformulate workflow optimization as a search problem over code-represented workflows, where LLM-invoking nodes are connected by edges. We introduce AFlow, an automated framework that efficiently explores this space using Monte Carlo Tree Search, iteratively refining workflows through code modification, tree-structured experience, and execution feedback. Empirical evaluations across six benchmark datasets demonstrate AFlow's efficacy, yielding a 5.7% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, AFlow enables smaller models to outperform GPT-4o on specific tasks at 4.55% of its inference cost in dollars.

|**2024-10-14**|**Denial-of-Service Poisoning Attacks against Large Language Models**|Recent studies have shown that LLMs are vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where adversarial inputs like spelling errors or non-semantic prompts trigger endless outputs without generating an [EOS] token. These attacks can potentially cause high latency and make LLM services inaccessible to other users or tasks. However, when there are speech-to-text interfaces (e.g., voice commands to a robot), executing such DoS attacks becomes challenging, as it is difficult to introduce spelling errors or non-semantic prompts through speech. A simple DoS attack in these scenarios would be to instruct the model to "Keep repeating Hello", but we observe that relying solely on natural instructions limits output length, which is bounded by the maximum length of the LLM's supervised finetuning (SFT) data. To overcome this limitation, we propose poisoning-based DoS (P-DoS) attacks for LLMs, demonstrating that injecting a single poisoned sample designed for DoS purposes can break the output length limit. For example, a poisoned sample can successfully attack GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini (via OpenAI's finetuning API) using less than $1, causing repeated outputs up to the maximum inference length (16K tokens, compared to 0.5K before poisoning). Additionally, we perform comprehensive ablation studies on open-source LLMs and extend our method to LLM agents, where attackers can control both the finetuning dataset and algorithm. Our findings underscore the urgent need for defenses against P-DoS attacks to secure LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/P-DoS.|Kuofeng Gao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10760)|**[link](https://github.com/sail-sg/p-dos)**|

However, concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs for code persist despite their widespread use. Much of the existing research focused on either training or evaluation, raising questions about whether stakeholders in training and evaluation align in their understanding of model trustworthiness and whether they can move toward a unified direction. In this paper, we propose a vision for a unified trustworthiness auditing framework, DataTrust, which adopts a data-centric approach that synergistically emphasizes both training and evaluation data and their correlations. DataTrust aims to connect model trustworthiness indicators in evaluation with data quality indicators in training. It autonomously inspects training data and evaluates model trustworthiness using synthesized data, attributing potential causes from specific evaluation data to corresponding training data and refining indicator connections. Additionally, a trustworthiness arena powered by DataTrust will engage crowdsourced input and deliver quantitative outcomes. We outline the benefits that various stakeholders can gain from DataTrust and discuss the challenges and opportunities it presents.|Chong Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09048)|null|
|**2024-10-11**|**Unraveling and Mitigating Safety Alignment Degradation of Vision-Language Models**|The safety alignment ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is prone to be degraded by the integration of the vision module compared to its LLM backbone. We investigate this phenomenon, dubbed as ''safety alignment degradation'' in this paper, and show that the challenge arises from the representation gap that emerges when introducing vision modality to VLMs. In particular, we show that the representations of multi-modal inputs shift away from that of text-only inputs which represent the distribution that the LLM backbone is optimized for. At the same time, the safety alignment capabilities, initially developed within the textual embedding space, do not successfully transfer to this new multi-modal representation space. To reduce safety alignment degradation, we introduce Cross-Modality Representation Manipulation (CMRM), an inference time representation intervention method for recovering the safety alignment ability that is inherent in the LLM backbone of VLMs, while simultaneously preserving the functional capabilities of VLMs. The empirical results show that our framework significantly recovers the alignment ability that is inherited from the LLM backbone with minimal impact on the fluency and linguistic capabilities of pre-trained VLMs even without additional training. Specifically, the unsafe rate of LLaVA-7B on multi-modal input can be reduced from 61.53% to as low as 3.15% with only inference-time intervention.

Simultaneously, it has become easier than ever to use AI tools to generate photorealistic images depicting any scene imaginable. Combining these two -- AI-generated fake news content -- is particularly potent and dangerous. To combat the spread of AI-generated fake news, we propose the MiRAGeNews Dataset, a dataset of 12,500 high-quality real and AI-generated image-caption pairs from state-of-the-art generators. We find that our dataset poses a significant challenge to humans (60% F-1) and state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs (< 24% F-1). Using our dataset we train a multi-modal detector (MiRAGe) that improves by +5.1% F-1 over state-of-the-art baselines on image-caption pairs from out-of-domain image generators and news publishers.

We first observe a positive correlation between the effectiveness of attacks and the internal behaviors of the models. For instance, attacks tend to be less effective when models pay more attention to system prompts designed to ensure LLM safety alignment. Building on this discovery, we introduce an enhanced method that manipulates models' attention scores to facilitate LLM jailbreaking, which we term AttnGCG. Empirically, AttnGCG shows consistent improvements in attack efficacy across diverse LLMs, achieving an average increase of ~7% in the Llama-2 series and ~10% in the Gemma series. Our strategy also demonstrates robust attack transferability against both unseen harmful goals and black-box LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Moreover, we note our attention-score visualization is more interpretable, allowing us to gain better insights into how our targeted attention manipulation facilitates more effective jailbreaking.

|**2024-10-11**|**Semi-Supervised Learning of Noisy Mixture of Experts Models**|The mixture of experts (MoE) model is a versatile framework for predictive modeling that has gained renewed interest in the age of large language models. A collection of predictive ``experts'' is learned along with a ``gating function'' that controls how much influence each expert is given when a prediction is made. This structure allows relatively simple models to excel in complex, heterogeneous data settings. In many contemporary settings, unlabeled data are widely available while labeled data are difficult to obtain. Semi-supervised learning methods seek to leverage the unlabeled data. We propose a novel method for semi-supervised learning of MoE models. We start from a semi-supervised MoE model that was developed by oceanographers that makes the strong assumption that the latent clustering structure in unlabeled data maps directly to the influence that the gating function should give each expert in the supervised task. We relax this assumption, imagining a noisy connection between the two, and propose an algorithm based on least trimmed squares, which succeeds even in the presence of misaligned data. Our theoretical analysis characterizes the conditions under which our approach yields estimators with a near-parametric rate of convergence.

Prior approaches rely on increasing temperature to increase diversity. However, contrary to popular belief, we show not only does this approach produce lower quality individual generations as temperature increases, but it depends on model's next-token probabilities being similar to the true distribution of answers. We propose \method{}, an alternative approach that uses the language model itself to partition the space into strata. At inference, a random stratum is selected and a sample drawn from within the strata. To measure diversity, we introduce CoverageQA, a dataset of underspecified questions with multiple equally plausible answers, and assess diversity by measuring KL Divergence between the output distribution and uniform distribution over valid ground truth answers. As computing probability per response/solution for proprietary models is infeasible, we measure recall on ground truth solutions. Our evaluation show using SimpleStrat achieves higher recall by 0.05 compared to GPT-4o and 0.36 average reduction in KL Divergence compared to Llama 3.|Justin Wong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09038)|null|

Recently, studies have proposed a Knowledge Distillation (KD) approach, reasoning distillation, which transfers such reasoning ability of LLMs through fine-tuning language models of multi-step rationales generated by LLM teachers. However, they have inadequately considered two challenges regarding insufficient distillation sets from the LLM teacher model, in terms of 1) data quality and 2) soft label provision. In this paper, we propose Mentor-KD, which effectively distills the multi-step reasoning capability of LLMs to smaller LMs while addressing the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, we exploit a mentor, intermediate-sized task-specific fine-tuned model, to augment additional CoT annotations and provide soft labels for the student model during reasoning distillation. We conduct extensive experiments and confirm Mentor-KD's effectiveness across various models and complex reasoning tasks.|Hojae Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09037)|**[link](https://github.com/2hojae/mentor-kd)**|

In practice, obtaining high-quality ptychographic images requires simultaneous optimization of numerous experimental and algorithmic parameters. Traditionally, parameter selection often relies on trial and error, leading to low-throughput workflows and potential human bias. In this work, we develop the "Ptychographic Experiment and Analysis Robot" (PEAR), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate data analysis in ptychography. To ensure high robustness and accuracy, PEAR employs multiple LLM agents for tasks including knowledge retrieval, code generation, parameter recommendation, and image reasoning. Our study demonstrates that PEAR's multi-agent design significantly improves the workflow success rate, even with smaller open-weight models such as LLaMA 3.1 8B.

|**2024-10-11**|**AgentHarm: A Benchmark for Measuring Harmfulness of LLM Agents**|The robustness of LLMs to jailbreak attacks, where users design prompts to circumvent safety measures and misuse model capabilities, has been studied primarily for LLMs acting as simple chatbots. Meanwhile, LLM agents -- which use external tools and can execute multi-stage tasks -- may pose a greater risk if misused, but their robustness remains underexplored. To facilitate research on LLM agent misuse, we propose a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. We evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. We publicly release AgentHarm to enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents.

However, there has been no investigation into whether contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can harness these sub-character features in Chinese through prompting. In this study, we establish a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' and VLMs' understanding of visual elements in Chinese characters, including radicals, composition structures, strokes, and stroke counts. Our results reveal that models surprisingly exhibit some, but still limited, knowledge of the visual information, regardless of whether images of characters are provided. To incite models' ability to use radicals, we further experiment with incorporating radicals into the prompts for Chinese language understanding tasks.

Among them, growing attention has been focused on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single LLM. Despite the structural simplicity and deployment-friendliness, training a monolithic MLLM with promising performance still remains challenging. In particular, the popular approaches adopt continuous pre-training to extend a pre-trained LLM to a monolithic MLLM, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting and leads to performance degeneration. In this paper, we aim to overcome this limitation from the perspective of delta tuning. Specifically, our core idea is to embed visual parameters into a pre-trained LLM, thereby incrementally learning visual knowledge from massive data via delta tuning, i.e., freezing the LLM when optimizing the visual parameters. Based on this principle, we present Mono-InternVL, a novel monolithic MLLM that seamlessly integrates a set of visual experts via a multimodal mixture-of-experts structure. Moreover, we propose an innovative pre-training strategy to maximize the visual capability of Mono-InternVL, namely Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP). In particular, EViP is designed as a progressive learning process for visual experts, which aims to fully exploit the visual knowledge from noisy data to high-quality data. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 16 benchmarks. Experimental results not only validate the superior performance of Mono-InternVL compared to the state-of-the-art MLLM on 6 multimodal benchmarks, e.g., +113 points over InternVL-1.5 on OCRBench, but also confirm its better deployment efficiency, with first token latency reduced by up to 67%.|Gen Luo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08202)|null|

In this process, tool documentation plays a crucial role by providing usage instructions for LLMs, thereby facilitating effective tool utilization. This paper concentrates on the critical challenge of bridging the comprehension gap between LLMs and external tools due to the inadequacies and inaccuracies inherent in existing human-centric tool documentation. We propose a novel framework, DRAFT, aimed at Dynamically Refining tool documentation through the Analysis of Feedback and Trails emanating from LLMs' interactions with external tools. This methodology pivots on an innovative trial-and-error approach, consisting of three distinct learning phases: experience gathering, learning from experience, and documentation rewriting, to iteratively enhance the tool documentation. This process is further optimized by implementing a diversity-promoting exploration strategy to ensure explorative diversity and a tool-adaptive termination mechanism to prevent overfitting while enhancing efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DRAFT's iterative, feedback-based refinement significantly ameliorates documentation quality, fostering a deeper comprehension and more effective utilization of tools by LLMs. Notably, our analysis reveals that the tool documentation refined via our approach demonstrates robust cross-model generalization capabilities.|Changle Qu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08197)|**[link](https://github.com/quchangle1/DRAFT)**|

Previous works involving continued mathematical pretraining often include code that utilizes math-related packages, which are primarily designed for fields such as engineering, machine learning, signal processing, or module testing, rather than being directly focused on mathematical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for generating mathematical code accompanied with corresponding reasoning steps for continued pretraining. Our approach begins with the construction of a high-quality mathematical continued pretraining dataset by incorporating math-related web data, code using mathematical packages, math textbooks, and synthetic data. Next, we construct reasoning steps by extracting LaTeX expressions, the conditions needed for the expressions, and the results of the expressions from the previously collected dataset. Based on this extracted information, we generate corresponding code to accurately capture the mathematical reasoning process. Appending the generated code to each reasoning step results in data consisting of paired natural language reasoning steps and their corresponding code. Combining this data with the original dataset results in a 19.2B-token high-performing mathematical pretraining corpus, which we name MathCode-Pile. Training several popular base models with this corpus significantly improves their mathematical abilities, leading to the creation of the MathCoder2 family of models. All of our data processing and training code is open-sourced, ensuring full transparency and easy reproducibility of the entire data collection and training pipeline.

Traditional training-time methods finetune LLMs using human preference datasets but incur significant training costs and require repeated training to handle diverse user preferences. Test-time alignment methods address this by using reward models (RMs) to guide frozen LLMs without retraining. However, existing test-time approaches rely on trajectory-level RMs which are designed to evaluate complete responses, making them unsuitable for autoregressive text generation that requires computing next-token rewards from partial responses. To address this, we introduce GenARM, a test-time alignment approach that leverages the Autoregressive Reward Model--a novel reward parametrization designed to predict next-token rewards for efficient and effective autoregressive generation. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this parametrization can provably guide frozen LLMs toward any distribution achievable by traditional RMs within the KL-regularized reinforcement learning framework. Experimental results show that GenARM significantly outperforms prior test-time alignment baselines and matches the performance of training-time methods. Additionally, GenARM enables efficient weak-to-strong guidance, aligning larger LLMs with smaller RMs without the high costs of training larger models. Furthermore, GenARM supports multi-objective alignment, allowing real-time trade-offs between preference dimensions and catering to diverse user preferences without retraining.|Yuancheng Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08193)|null|

Existing zero-shot object navigation methods prompt LLM with the text of spatially closed objects, which lacks enough scene context for in-depth reasoning. To better preserve the information of environment and fully exploit the reasoning ability of LLM, we propose to represent the observed scene with 3D scene graph. The scene graph encodes the relationships between objects, groups and rooms with a LLM-friendly structure, for which we design a hierarchical chain-of-thought prompt to help LLM reason the goal location according to scene context by traversing the nodes and edges. Moreover, benefit from the scene graph representation, we further design a re-perception mechanism to empower the object navigation framework with the ability to correct perception error. We conduct extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D and RoboTHOR environments, where SG-Nav surpasses previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by more than 10% SR on all benchmarks, while the decision process is explainable. To the best of our knowledge, SG-Nav is the first zero-shot method that achieves even higher performance than supervised object navigation methods on the challenging MP3D benchmark.|Hang Yin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08189)|null|
|**2024-10-10**|**Sample then Identify: A General Framework for Risk Control and Assessment in Multimodal Large Language Models**|Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit promising advancements across various tasks, yet they still encounter significant trustworthiness issues. Prior studies apply Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) in language modeling to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees. However, these methods typically rely on internal model logits or are restricted to multiple-choice settings, which hampers their generalizability and adaptability in dynamic, open-ended environments. In this paper, we introduce TRON, a two-step framework for risk control and assessment, applicable to any MLLM that supports sampling in both open-ended and closed-ended scenarios. TRON comprises two main components: (1) a novel conformal score to sample response sets of minimum size, and (2) a nonconformity score to identify high-quality responses based on self-consistency theory, controlling the error rates by two specific risk levels. Furthermore, we investigate semantic redundancy in prediction sets within open-ended contexts for the first time, leading to a promising evaluation metric for MLLMs based on average set size. Our comprehensive experiments across four Video Question-Answering (VideoQA) datasets utilizing eight MLLMs show that TRON achieves desired error rates bounded by two user-specified risk levels. Additionally, deduplicated prediction sets maintain adaptiveness while being more efficient and stable for risk assessment under different risk levels.|Qingni Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08174)|null|
|**2024-10-10**|**On the Evaluation of Generative Robotic Simulations**|Due to the difficulty of acquiring extensive real-world data, robot simulation has become crucial for parallel training and sim-to-real transfer, highlighting the importance of scalable simulated robotic tasks. Foundation models have demonstrated impressive capacities in autonomously generating feasible robotic tasks. However, this new paradigm underscores the challenge of adequately evaluating these autonomously generated tasks. To address this, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored to generative simulations. Our framework segments evaluation into three core aspects: quality, diversity, and generalization. For single-task quality, we evaluate the realism of the generated task and the completeness of the generated trajectories using large language models and vision-language models. In terms of diversity, we measure both task and data diversity through text similarity of task descriptions and world model loss trained on collected task trajectories. For task-level generalization, we assess the zero-shot generalization ability on unseen tasks of a policy trained with multiple generated tasks. Experiments conducted on three representative task generation pipelines demonstrate that the results from our framework are highly consistent with human evaluations, confirming the feasibility and validity of our approach. The findings reveal that while metrics of quality and diversity can be achieved through certain methods, no single approach excels across all metrics, suggesting a need for greater focus on balancing these different metrics. Additionally, our analysis further highlights the common challenge of low generalization capability faced by current works.

Agent S aims to address three key challenges in automating computer tasks: acquiring domain-specific knowledge, planning over long task horizons, and handling dynamic, non-uniform interfaces. To this end, Agent S introduces experience-augmented hierarchical planning, which learns from external knowledge search and internal experience retrieval at multiple levels, facilitating efficient task planning and subtask execution. In addition, it employs an Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) to better elicit the reasoning and control capabilities of GUI agents based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark shows that Agent S outperforms the baseline by 9.37% on success rate (an 83.6% relative improvement) and achieves a new state-of-the-art. Comprehensive analysis highlights the effectiveness of individual components and provides insights for future improvements. Furthermore, Agent S demonstrates broad generalizability to different operating systems on a newly-released WindowsAgentArena benchmark.

|**2024-10-10**|**Rewarding Progress: Scaling Automated Process Verifiers for LLM Reasoning**|A promising approach for improving reasoning in large language models is to use process reward models (PRMs). PRMs provide feedback at each step of a multi-step reasoning trace, potentially improving credit assignment over outcome reward models (ORMs) that only provide feedback at the final step. However, collecting dense, per-step human labels is not scalable, and training PRMs from automatically-labeled data has thus far led to limited gains. To improve a base policy by running search against a PRM or using it as dense rewards for reinforcement learning (RL), we ask: "How should we design process rewards?". Our key insight is that, to be effective, the process reward for a step should measure progress: a change in the likelihood of producing a correct response in the future, before and after taking the step, corresponding to the notion of step-level advantages in RL. Crucially, this progress should be measured under a prover policy distinct from the base policy. We theoretically characterize the set of good provers and our results show that optimizing process rewards from such provers improves exploration during test-time search and online RL. In fact, our characterization shows that weak prover policies can substantially improve a stronger base policy, which we also observe empirically. We validate our claims by training process advantage verifiers (PAVs) to predict progress under such provers, and show that compared to ORMs, test-time search against PAVs is $>8\%$ more accurate, and $1.5-5\times$ more compute-efficient. Online RL with dense rewards from PAVs enables one of the first results with $5-6\times$ gain in sample efficiency, and $>6\%$ gain in accuracy, over ORMs.|Amrith Setlur et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08146)|null|
|**2024-10-10**|**Insight Over Sight? Exploring the Vision-Knowledge Conflicts in Multimodal LLMs**|This paper explores the problem of commonsense-level vision-knowledge conflict in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where visual information contradicts model's internal commonsense knowledge (see Figure 1). To study this issue, we introduce an automated pipeline, augmented with human-in-the-loop quality control, to establish a benchmark aimed at simulating and assessing the conflicts in MLLMs. Utilizing this pipeline, we have crafted a diagnostic benchmark comprising 374 original images and 1,122 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs. This benchmark covers two types of conflict target and three question difficulty levels, providing a thorough assessment tool. Through this benchmark, we evaluate the conflict-resolution capabilities of nine representative MLLMs across various model families and find a noticeable over-reliance on textual queries. Drawing on these findings, we propose a novel prompting strategy, "Focus-on-Vision" (FoV), which markedly enhances MLLMs' ability to favor visual data over conflicting textual knowledge. Our detailed analysis and the newly proposed strategy significantly advance the understanding and mitigating of vision-knowledge conflicts in MLLMs. The data and code are made publicly available.|Xiaoyuan Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08145)|null|
|**2024-10-09**|**MM-Ego: Towards Building Egocentric Multimodal LLMs**|This research aims to comprehensively explore building a multimodal foundation model for egocentric video understanding. To achieve this goal, we work on three fronts. First, as there is a lack of QA data for egocentric video understanding, we develop a data engine that efficiently generates 7M high-quality QA samples for egocentric videos ranging from 30 seconds to one hour long, based on human-annotated data. This is currently the largest egocentric QA dataset. Second, we contribute a challenging egocentric QA benchmark with 629 videos and 7,026 questions to evaluate the models' ability in recognizing and memorizing visual details across videos of varying lengths. We introduce a new de-biasing evaluation method to help mitigate the unavoidable language bias present in the models being evaluated. Third, we propose a specialized multimodal architecture featuring a novel "Memory Pointer Prompting" mechanism. This design includes a global glimpse step to gain an overarching understanding of the entire video and identify key visual information, followed by a fallback step that utilizes the key visual information to generate responses. This enables the model to more effectively comprehend extended video content. With the data, benchmark, and model, we successfully build MM-Ego, an egocentric multimodal LLM that shows powerful performance on egocentric video understanding.|Hanrong Ye et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07177)|null|
|**2024-10-09**|**Astute RAG: Overcoming Imperfect Retrieval Augmentation and Knowledge Conflicts for Large Language Models**|Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while effective in integrating external knowledge to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs), can be undermined by imperfect retrieval, which may introduce irrelevant, misleading, or even malicious information. Despite its importance, previous studies have rarely explored the behavior of RAG through joint analysis on how errors from imperfect retrieval attribute and propagate, and how potential conflicts arise between the LLMs' internal knowledge and external sources. We find that imperfect retrieval augmentation might be inevitable and quite harmful, through controlled analysis under realistic conditions. We identify the knowledge conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a bottleneck to overcome in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To render LLMs resilient to imperfect retrieval, we propose Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach that adaptively elicits essential information from LLMs' internal knowledge, iteratively consolidates internal and external knowledge with source-awareness, and finalizes the answer according to information reliability. Our experiments using Gemini and Claude demonstrate that Astute RAG significantly outperforms previous robustness-enhanced RAG methods. Notably, Astute RAG is the only approach that matches or exceeds the performance of LLMs without RAG under worst-case scenarios. Further analysis reveals that Astute RAG effectively resolves knowledge conflicts, improving the reliability and trustworthiness of RAG systems.|Fei Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07176)|null|
|**2024-10-09**|**Do better language models have crisper vision?**|How well do text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) grasp the visual world? As LLMs are increasingly used in computer vision, addressing this question becomes both fundamental and pertinent. However, existing studies have primarily focused on limited scenarios, such as their ability to generate visual content or cluster multimodal data. To this end, we propose the Visual Text Representation Benchmark (ViTeRB) to isolate key properties that make language models well-aligned with the visual world. With this, we identify large-scale decoder-based LLMs as ideal candidates for representing text in vision-centric contexts, counter to the current practice of utilizing text encoders. Building on these findings, we propose ShareLock, an ultra-lightweight CLIP-like model. By leveraging precomputable frozen features from strong vision and language models, ShareLock achieves an impressive 51% accuracy on ImageNet despite utilizing just 563k image-caption pairs. Moreover, training requires only 1 GPU hour (or 10 hours including the precomputation of features) - orders of magnitude less than prior methods. Code will be released.|Jona Ruthardt et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07173)|null|
|**2024-10-09**|**Glider: Global and Local Instruction-Driven Expert Router**|The availability of performant pre-trained models has led to a proliferation of fine-tuned expert models that are specialized to particular domains. This has enabled the creation of powerful and adaptive routing-based "Model MoErging" methods with the goal of using expert modules to create an aggregate system with improved performance or generalization. However, existing MoErging methods often prioritize generalization to unseen tasks at the expense of performance on held-in tasks, which limits its practical applicability in real-world deployment scenarios. We observe that current token-level routing mechanisms neglect the global semantic context of the input task. This token-wise independence hinders effective expert selection for held-in tasks, as routing decisions fail to incorporate the semantic properties of the task. To address this, we propose, Global and Local Instruction Driven Expert Router (GLIDER) that integrates a multi-scale routing mechanism, encompassing a semantic global router and a learned local router. The global router leverages LLM's advanced reasoning capabilities for semantic-related contexts to enhance expert selection. Given the input query and LLM, the router generates semantic task instructions that guide the retrieval of the most relevant experts across all layers. This global guidance is complemented by a local router that facilitates token-level routing decisions within each module, enabling finer control and enhanced performance on unseen tasks. Our experiments using T5-based models for T0 and FLAN tasks demonstrate that GLIDER achieves substantially improved held-in performance while maintaining strong generalization on held-out tasks. We also perform ablations experiments to dive deeper into the components of GLIDER. Our experiments highlight the importance of our multi-scale routing that leverages LLM-driven semantic reasoning for MoErging methods.|Pingzhi Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07172)|null|
|**2024-10-09**|**Deciphering Cross-Modal Alignment in Large Vision-Language Models with Modality Integration Rate**|We present the Modality Integration Rate (MIR), an effective, robust, and generalized metric to indicate the multi-modal pre-training quality of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). Large-scale pre-training plays a critical role in building capable LVLMs, while evaluating its training quality without the costly supervised fine-tuning stage is under-explored. Loss, perplexity, and in-context evaluation results are commonly used pre-training metrics for Large Language Models (LLMs), while we observed that these metrics are less indicative when aligning a well-trained LLM with a new modality. Due to the lack of proper metrics, the research of LVLMs in the critical pre-training stage is hindered greatly, including the training data choice, efficient module design, etc. In this paper, we propose evaluating the pre-training quality from the inter-modal distribution distance perspective and present MIR, the Modality Integration Rate, which is 1) \textbf{Effective} to represent the pre-training quality and show a positive relation with the benchmark performance after supervised fine-tuning. 2) \textbf{Robust} toward different training/evaluation data. 3) \textbf{Generalize} across training configurations and architecture choices. We conduct a series of pre-training experiments to explore the effectiveness of MIR and observe satisfactory results that MIR is indicative about training data selection, training strategy schedule, and model architecture design to get better pre-training results. We hope MIR could be a helpful metric for building capable LVLMs and inspire the following research about modality alignment in different areas.

|**2024-10-09**|**Embodied Agent Interface: Benchmarking LLMs for Embodied Decision Making**|We aim to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for embodied decision making. While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.|Manling Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07166)|**[link](https://github.com/embodied-agent-interface/embodied-agent-interface)**|
|**2024-10-09**|**AvatarGO: Zero-shot 4D Human-Object Interaction Generation and Animation**|Recent advancements in diffusion models have led to significant improvements in the generation and animation of 4D full-body human-object interactions (HOI). Nevertheless, existing methods primarily focus on SMPL-based motion generation, which is limited by the scarcity of realistic large-scale interaction data. This constraint affects their ability to create everyday HOI scenes. This paper addresses this challenge using a zero-shot approach with a pre-trained diffusion model. Despite this potential, achieving our goals is difficult due to the diffusion model's lack of understanding of ''where'' and ''how'' objects interact with the human body. To tackle these issues, we introduce AvatarGO, a novel framework designed to generate animatable 4D HOI scenes directly from textual inputs. Specifically, 1) for the ''where'' challenge, we propose LLM-guided contact retargeting, which employs Lang-SAM to identify the contact body part from text prompts, ensuring precise representation of human-object spatial relations. 2) For the ''how'' challenge, we introduce correspondence-aware motion optimization that constructs motion fields for both human and object models using the linear blend skinning function from SMPL-X. Our framework not only generates coherent compositional motions, but also exhibits greater robustness in handling penetration issues. Extensive experiments with existing methods validate AvatarGO's superior generation and animation capabilities on a variety of human-object pairs and diverse poses. As the first attempt to synthesize 4D avatars with object interactions, we hope AvatarGO could open new doors for human-centric 4D content creation.|Yukang Cao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07164)|null|
|**2024-10-09**|**Simplicity Prevails: Rethinking Negative Preference Optimization for LLM Unlearning**|In this work, we address the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning, aiming to remove unwanted data influences and associated model capabilities (e.g., copyrighted data or harmful content generation) while preserving essential model utilities, without the need for retraining from scratch. Despite the growing need for LLM unlearning, a principled optimization framework remains lacking. To this end, we revisit the state-of-the-art approach, negative preference optimization (NPO), and identify the issue of reference model bias, which could undermine NPO's effectiveness, particularly when unlearning forget data of varying difficulty. Given that, we propose a simple yet effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that 'simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We also provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages, supported by analysis using mixtures of Markov chains. Furthermore, we present extensive experiments validating SimNPO's superiority over existing unlearning baselines in benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, and robustness against relearning attacks.

|**2024-10-09**|**Trans4D: Realistic Geometry-Aware Transition for Compositional Text-to-4D Synthesis**|Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video generation, further improving the effectiveness of 4D synthesis. Existing 4D generation methods can generate high-quality 4D objects or scenes based on user-friendly conditions, benefiting the gaming and video industries. However, these methods struggle to synthesize significant object deformation of complex 4D transitions and interactions within scenes. To address this challenge, we propose Trans4D, a novel text-to-4D synthesis framework that enables realistic complex scene transitions. Specifically, we first use multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to produce a physic-aware scene description for 4D scene initialization and effective transition timing planning. Then we propose a geometry-aware 4D transition network to realize a complex scene-level 4D transition based on the plan, which involves expressive geometrical object deformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Trans4D consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in generating 4D scenes with accurate and high-quality transitions, validating its effectiveness.

|**2024-10-09**|**Cheating Automatic LLM Benchmarks: Null Models Achieve High Win Rates**|Automatic LLM benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard-Auto, and MT-Bench, have become popular for evaluating language models due to their cost-effectiveness and scalability compared to human evaluation. Achieving high win rates on these benchmarks can significantly boost the promotional impact of newly released language models. This promotional benefit may motivate tricks, such as manipulating model output length or style to game win rates, even though several mechanisms have been developed to control length and disentangle style to reduce gameability. Nonetheless, we show that even a "null model" that always outputs a constant response (irrelevant to input instructions) can cheat automatic benchmarks and achieve top-ranked win rates: an 86.5% LC win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0; an 83.0 score on Arena-Hard-Auto; and a 9.55 score on MT-Bench. Moreover, the crafted cheating outputs are transferable because we assume that the instructions of these benchmarks (e.g., 805 samples of AlpacaEval 2.0) are private and cannot be accessed. While our experiments are primarily proof-of-concept, an adversary could use LLMs to generate more imperceptible cheating responses, unethically benefiting from high win rates and promotional impact. Our findings call for the development of anti-cheating mechanisms for reliable automatic benchmarks.

|**2024-10-07**|**Data Advisor: Dynamic Data Curation for Safety Alignment of Large Language Models**|Data is a crucial element in large language model (LLM) alignment. Recent studies have explored using LLMs for efficient data collection. However, LLM-generated data often suffers from quality issues, with underrepresented or absent aspects and low-quality datapoints. To address these problems, we propose Data Advisor, an enhanced LLM-based method for generating data that takes into account the characteristics of the desired dataset. Starting from a set of pre-defined principles in hand, Data Advisor monitors the status of the generated data, identifies weaknesses in the current dataset, and advises the next iteration of data generation accordingly. Data Advisor can be easily integrated into existing data generation methods to enhance data quality and coverage. Experiments on safety alignment of three representative LLMs (i.e., Mistral, Llama2, and Falcon) demonstrate the effectiveness of Data Advisor in enhancing model safety against various fine-grained safety issues without sacrificing model utility.|Fei Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05269)|null|
|**2024-10-07**|**Grounding Partially-Defined Events in Multimodal Data**|How are we able to learn about complex current events just from short snippets of video? While natural language enables straightforward ways to represent under-specified, partially observable events, visual data does not facilitate analogous methods and, consequently, introduces unique challenges in event understanding. With the growing prevalence of vision-capable AI agents, these systems must be able to model events from collections of unstructured video data. To tackle robust event modeling in multimodal settings, we introduce a multimodal formulation for partially-defined events and cast the extraction of these events as a three-stage span retrieval task. We propose a corresponding benchmark for this task, MultiVENT-G, that consists of 14.5 hours of densely annotated current event videos and 1,168 text documents, containing 22.8K labeled event-centric entities. We propose a collection of LLM-driven approaches to the task of multimodal event analysis, and evaluate them on MultiVENT-G. Results illustrate the challenges that abstract event understanding poses and demonstrates promise in event-centric video-language systems.|Kate Sanders et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05267)|null|
|**2024-10-07**|**PrefixQuant: Static Quantization Beats Dynamic through Prefixed Outliers in LLMs**|Quantization is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) by enhancing memory efficiency and inference speed. Existing methods for activation quantization mainly address channel-wise outliers, often neglecting token-wise outliers, leading to reliance on costly per-token dynamic quantization. To address this, we introduce PrefixQuant, a novel technique that isolates outlier tokens offline without re-training. Specifically, PrefixQuant identifies high-frequency outlier tokens and prefixes them in the KV cache, preventing the generation of outlier tokens during inference and simplifying quantization. To our knowledge, PrefixQuant is the first to enable efficient per-tensor static quantization to outperform expensive per-token dynamic quantization. For instance, in W4A4KV4 (4- bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) Llama-3-8B, PrefixQuant with per-tensor static quantization achieves a 7.43 WikiText2 perplexity and 71.08% average accuracy on 5 common-sense reasoning tasks, outperforming previous per-token dynamic quantization methods like QuaRot with 0.98 perplexity improvement and +5.98 points accuracy. Additionally, the inference speed of W4A4 quantized models using PrefixQuant is 1.60x to 2.81x faster than FP16 models and exceeds QuaRot models by 1.2x to 1.3x. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/ChenMnZ/PrefixQuant}.|Mengzhao Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05265)|**[link](https://github.com/chenmnz/prefixquant)**|
|**2024-10-07**|**TurtleBench: Evaluating Top Language Models via Real-World Yes/No Puzzles**|As the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) expands, the demand for reliable evaluations increases. Existing LLM evaluation benchmarks primarily rely on static datasets, making it challenging to assess model performance in dynamic interactions with users. Moreover, these benchmarks often depend on specific background knowledge, complicating the measurement of a model's logical reasoning capabilities. Other dynamic evaluation methods based on strong models or manual efforts may introduce biases and incur high costs and time demands, hindering large-scale application. To address these issues, we propose TurtleBench. TurtleBench collects real user guesses from our online Turtle Soup Puzzle platform that we developed. This approach allows for the relatively dynamic generation of evaluation datasets, mitigating the risk of model cheating while aligning assessments more closely with genuine user needs for reasoning capabilities, thus enhancing the reliability of evaluations. TurtleBench includes 1,532 user guesses along with the correctness of guesses after annotation. Using this dataset, we thoroughly evaluated nine of the most advanced LLMs available today. Notably, the OpenAI o1 series models did not achieve leading results in these evaluations. We propose several hypotheses for further research, such as "the latent reasoning of o1 utilizes trivial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques" and "increasing CoT length not only provides reasoning benefits but also incurs noise costs."|Qingchen Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05262)|**[link](https://github.com/mazzzystar/TurtleBench)**|
|**2024-10-07**|**Differential Transformer**|Transformer tends to overallocate attention to irrelevant context. In this work, we introduce Diff Transformer, which amplifies attention to the relevant context while canceling noise. Specifically, the differential attention mechanism calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. The subtraction cancels noise, promoting the emergence of sparse attention patterns. Experimental results on language modeling show that Diff Transformer outperforms Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and training tokens. More intriguingly, it offers notable advantages in practical applications, such as long-context modeling, key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation, in-context learning, and reduction of activation outliers. By being less distracted by irrelevant context, Diff Transformer can mitigate hallucination in question answering and text summarization. For in-context learning, Diff Transformer not only enhances accuracy but is also more robust to order permutation, which was considered as a chronic robustness issue. The results position Diff Transformer as a highly effective and promising architecture to advance large language models.|Tianzhu Ye et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05258)|null|
|**2024-10-07**|**GLEE: A Unified Framework and Benchmark for Language-based Economic Environments**|Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in economic and strategic interactions, where communication via natural language is often prevalent. This raises key questions: Do LLMs behave rationally? Can they mimic human behavior? Do they tend to reach an efficient and fair outcome? What is the role of natural language in the strategic interaction? How do characteristics of the economic environment influence these dynamics? These questions become crucial concerning the economic and societal implications of integrating LLM-based agents into real-world data-driven systems, such as online retail platforms and recommender systems. While the ML community has been exploring the potential of LLMs in such multi-agent setups, varying assumptions, design choices and evaluation criteria across studies make it difficult to draw robust and meaningful conclusions. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for standardizing research on two-player, sequential, language-based games. Inspired by the economic literature, we define three base families of games with consistent parameterization, degrees of freedom and economic measures to evaluate agents' performance (self-gain), as well as the game outcome (efficiency and fairness). We develop an open-source framework for interaction simulation and analysis, and utilize it to collect a dataset of LLM vs. LLM interactions across numerous game configurations and an additional dataset of human vs. LLM interactions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate how our framework and dataset can be used to: (i) compare the behavior of LLM-based agents to human players in various economic contexts; (ii) evaluate agents in both individual and collective performance measures; and (iii) quantify the effect of the economic characteristics of the environments on the behavior of agents.|Eilam Shapira et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05254)|**[link](https://github.com/eilamshapira/GLEE)**|
|**2024-10-07**|**Causal Micro-Narratives**|We present a novel approach to classify causal micro-narratives from text. These narratives are sentence-level explanations of the cause(s) and/or effect(s) of a target subject. The approach requires only a subject-specific ontology of causes and effects, and we demonstrate it with an application to inflation narratives. Using a human-annotated dataset spanning historical and contemporary US news articles for training, we evaluate several large language models (LLMs) on this multi-label classification task. The best-performing model--a fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B--achieves F1 scores of 0.87 on narrative detection and 0.71 on narrative classification. Comprehensive error analysis reveals challenges arising from linguistic ambiguity and highlights how model errors often mirror human annotator disagreements.

|**2024-10-07**|**SFTMix: Elevating Language Model Instruction Tuning with Mixup Recipe**|To induce desired behaviors in large language models (LLMs) for interaction-driven tasks, the instruction-tuning stage typically trains LLMs on instruction-response pairs using the next-token prediction (NTP) loss. Previous work aiming to improve instruction-tuning performance often emphasizes the need for higher-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, which typically involves expensive data filtering with proprietary LLMs or labor-intensive data generation by human annotators. However, these approaches do not fully leverage the datasets' intrinsic properties, resulting in high computational and labor costs, thereby limiting scalability and performance gains. In this paper, we propose SFTMix, a novel recipe that elevates instruction-tuning performance beyond the conventional NTP paradigm, without the need for well-curated datasets. Observing that LLMs exhibit uneven confidence across the semantic representation space, we argue that examples with different confidence levels should play distinct roles during the instruction-tuning process. Based on this insight, SFTMix leverages training dynamics to identify examples with varying confidence levels, then applies a Mixup-based regularization to mitigate overfitting on confident examples while propagating supervision signals to improve learning on relatively unconfident ones. This approach enables SFTMix to significantly outperform NTP across a wide range of instruction-following and healthcare domain-specific SFT tasks, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse LLM families and scalability to datasets of any size. Comprehensive ablation studies further verify the robustness of SFTMix's design choices, underscoring its versatility in consistently enhancing performance across different LLMs and datasets in broader natural language processing applications.|Yuxin Xiao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05248)|null|

However, the effectiveness of these agents hinges on the robustness of their grounding capability. Current GUI agents predominantly utilize text-based representations such as HTML or accessibility trees, which, despite their utility, often introduce noise, incompleteness, and increased computational overhead. In this paper, we advocate a human-like embodiment for GUI agents that perceive the environment entirely visually and directly take pixel-level operations on the GUI. The key is visual grounding models that can accurately map diverse referring expressions of GUI elements to their coordinates on the GUI across different platforms. We show that a simple recipe, which includes web-based synthetic data and slight adaptation of the LLaVA architecture, is surprisingly effective for training such visual grounding models. We collect the largest dataset for GUI visual grounding so far, containing 10M GUI elements and their referring expressions over 1.3M screenshots, and use it to train UGround, a strong universal visual grounding model for GUI agents. Empirical results on six benchmarks spanning three categories (grounding, offline agent, and online agent) show that 1) UGround substantially outperforms existing visual grounding models for GUI agents, by up to 20% absolute, and 2) agents with UGround outperform state-of-the-art agents, despite the fact that existing agents use additional text-based input while ours only uses visual perception. These results provide strong support for the feasibility and promises of GUI agents that navigate the digital world as humans do.|Boyu Gou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05243)|null|
|**2024-10-07**|**GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models**|Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their formal reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematics. The GSM8K benchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on grade-school-level questions. While the performance of LLMs on GSM8K has significantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear whether their mathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions about the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, we conduct a large-scale study on several SOTA open and closed models. To overcome the limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved benchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a diverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations, providing key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning capabilities of models.Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question. Specifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and show that their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases. We hypothesize that this decline is because current LLMs cannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from their training data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question causes significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art models, even though the clause doesn't contribute to the reasoning chain needed for the final answer. Overall, our work offers a more nuanced understanding of LLMs' capabilities and limitations in mathematical reasoning.|Iman Mirzadeh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05229)|null|
|**2024-10-04**|**Enhance Reasoning by Learning from Mistakes: Peer-Review Knowledge Distillation from Multiple Large Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited complex reasoning abilities by generating question rationales and demonstrated exceptional performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, these reasoning capabilities generally emerge in models with tens of billions of parameters, creating significant computational challenges for real-world deployment. Recent research has concentrated on improving open-source smaller models through knowledge distillation (KD) from commercial LLMs. Nevertheless, most of these studies rely solely on the responses from one single LLM as the gold rationale for training. In this paper, we introduce a novel Mistake-Aware Peer-Review Distillation (MAPD) approach: 1) Instead of merely obtaining gold rationales from teachers, our method asks teachers to identify and explain the student's mistakes, providing customized instruction learning data. 2) We design a simulated peer-review process between teacher LLMs, which selects only the generated rationales above the acceptance threshold. This reduces the chance of teachers guessing correctly with flawed rationale, improving instructional data quality. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.|Zhuochun Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03663)|null|

However, their unethical applications, such as disseminating disinformation, have become a growing concern. Although recent works have proposed a number of LLM detection methods, their robustness and reliability remain unclear. In this paper, we present RAFT: a grammar error-free black-box attack against existing LLM detectors. In contrast to previous attacks for language models, our method exploits the transferability of LLM embeddings at the word-level while preserving the original text quality. We leverage an auxiliary embedding to greedily select candidate words to perturb against the target detector. Experiments reveal that our attack effectively compromises all detectors in the study across various domains by up to 99%, and are transferable across source models. Manual human evaluation studies show our attacks are realistic and indistinguishable from original human-written text. We also show that examples generated by RAFT can be used to train adversarially robust detectors. Our work shows that current LLM detectors are not adversarially robust, underscoring the urgent need for more resilient detection mechanisms.|James Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03658)|null|
|**2024-10-04**|**GenSim2: Scaling Robot Data Generation with Multi-modal and Reasoning LLMs**|Robotic simulation today remains challenging to scale up due to the human efforts required to create diverse simulation tasks and scenes. Simulation-trained policies also face scalability issues as many sim-to-real methods focus on a single task. To address these challenges, this work proposes GenSim2, a scalable framework that leverages coding LLMs with multi-modal and reasoning capabilities for complex and realistic simulation task creation, including long-horizon tasks with articulated objects. To automatically generate demonstration data for these tasks at scale, we propose planning and RL solvers that generalize within object categories. The pipeline can generate data for up to 100 articulated tasks with 200 objects and reduce the required human efforts. To utilize such data, we propose an effective multi-task language-conditioned policy architecture, dubbed proprioceptive point-cloud transformer (PPT), that learns from the generated demonstrations and exhibits strong sim-to-real zero-shot transfer. Combining the proposed pipeline and the policy architecture, we show a promising usage of GenSim2 that the generated data can be used for zero-shot transfer or co-train with real-world collected data, which enhances the policy performance by 20% compared with training exclusively on limited real data.|Pu Hua et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03645)|null|
|**2024-10-04**|**Aligning LLMs with Individual Preferences via Interaction**|As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly advanced capabilities, aligning their behaviors with human values and preferences becomes crucial for their wide adoption. While previous research focuses on general alignment to principles such as helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty, the need to account for individual and diverse preferences has been largely overlooked, potentially undermining customized human experiences. To address this gap, we train LLMs that can ''interact to align'', essentially cultivating the meta-skill of LLMs to implicitly infer the unspoken personalized preferences of the current user through multi-turn conversations, and then dynamically align their following behaviors and responses to these inferred preferences. Our approach involves establishing a diverse pool of 3,310 distinct user personas by initially creating seed examples, which are then expanded through iterative self-generation and filtering. Guided by distinct user personas, we leverage multi-LLM collaboration to develop a multi-turn preference dataset containing 3K+ multi-turn conversations in tree structures. Finally, we apply supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs using this dataset. For evaluation, we establish the ALOE (ALign With CustOmized PrEferences) benchmark, consisting of 100 carefully selected examples and well-designed metrics to measure the customized alignment performance during conversations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enabling dynamic, personalized alignment via interaction.|Shujin Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03642)|**[link](https://github.com/shujinwu-0814/aloe)**|
|**2024-10-04**|**Large Language Model Performance Benchmarking on Mobile Platforms: A Thorough Evaluation**|As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into every aspect of our work and daily lives, there are growing concerns about user privacy, which push the trend toward local deployment of these models. There are a number of lightweight LLMs (e.g., Gemini Nano, LLAMA2 7B) that can run locally on smartphones, providing users with greater control over their personal data. As a rapidly emerging application, we are concerned about their performance on commercial-off-the-shelf mobile devices. To fully understand the current landscape of LLM deployment on mobile platforms, we conduct a comprehensive measurement study on mobile devices. We evaluate both metrics that affect user experience, including token throughput, latency, and battery consumption, as well as factors critical to developers, such as resource utilization, DVFS strategies, and inference engines. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis of how these hardware capabilities and system dynamics affect on-device LLM performance, which may help developers identify and address bottlenecks for mobile LLM applications. We also provide comprehensive comparisons across the mobile system-on-chips (SoCs) from major vendors, highlighting their performance differences in handling LLM workloads. We hope that this study can provide insights for both the development of on-device LLMs and the design for future mobile system architecture.|Jie Xiao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03613)|null|
|**2024-10-04**|**TICKing All the Boxes: Generated Checklists Improve LLM Evaluation and Generation**|Given the widespread adoption and usage of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to have flexible and interpretable evaluations of their instruction-following ability. Preference judgments between model outputs have become the de facto evaluation standard, despite distilling complex, multi-faceted preferences into a single ranking. Furthermore, as human annotation is slow and costly, LLMs are increasingly used to make these judgments, at the expense of reliability and interpretability. In this work, we propose TICK (Targeted Instruct-evaluation with ChecKlists), a fully automated, interpretable evaluation protocol that structures evaluations with LLM-generated, instruction-specific checklists. We first show that, given an instruction, LLMs can reliably produce high-quality, tailored evaluation checklists that decompose the instruction into a series of YES/NO questions. Each question asks whether a candidate response meets a specific requirement of the instruction. We demonstrate that using TICK leads to a significant increase (46.4% $\to$ 52.2%) in the frequency of exact agreements between LLM judgements and human preferences, as compared to having an LLM directly score an output. We then show that STICK (Self-TICK) can be used to improve generation quality across multiple benchmarks via self-refinement and Best-of-N selection. STICK self-refinement on LiveBench reasoning tasks leads to an absolute gain of $+$7.8%, whilst Best-of-N selection with STICK attains $+$6.3% absolute improvement on the real-world instruction dataset, WildBench. In light of this, structured, multi-faceted self-improvement is shown to be a promising way to further advance LLM capabilities. Finally, by providing LLM-generated checklists to human evaluators tasked with directly scoring LLM responses to WildBench instructions, we notably increase inter-annotator agreement (0.194 $\to$ 0.256).|Jonathan Cook et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03608)|null|
|**2024-10-04**|**Efficiently Identifying Watermarked Segments in Mixed-Source Texts**|Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to detect synthetic text, mitigating misuse cases like fake news and academic dishonesty. While existing watermarking detection techniques primarily focus on classifying entire documents as watermarked or not, they often neglect the common scenario of identifying individual watermark segments within longer, mixed-source documents. Drawing inspiration from plagiarism detection systems, we propose two novel methods for partial watermark detection. First, we develop a geometry cover detection framework aimed at determining whether there is a watermark segment in long text. Second, we introduce an adaptive online learning algorithm to pinpoint the precise location of watermark segments within the text. Evaluated on three popular watermarking techniques (KGW-Watermark, Unigram-Watermark, and Gumbel-Watermark), our approach achieves high accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Moreover, our framework is adaptable to other watermarking techniques, offering new insights for precise watermark detection.|Xuandong Zhao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03600)|null|
|**2024-10-04**|**Understanding Reasoning in Chain-of-Thought from the Hopfieldian View**|Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various tasks, with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting emerging as a key technique to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, existing research primarily focuses on improving performance, lacking a comprehensive framework to explain and understand the fundamental factors behind CoT's success. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel perspective grounded in the Hopfieldian view of cognition in cognitive neuroscience. We establish a connection between CoT reasoning and key cognitive elements such as stimuli, actions, neural populations, and representation spaces. From our view, we can understand the reasoning process as the movement between these representation spaces. Building on this insight, we develop a method for localizing reasoning errors in the response of CoTs. Moreover, we propose the Representation-of-Thought (RoT) framework, which leverages the robustness of low-dimensional representation spaces to enhance the robustness of the reasoning process in CoTs. Experimental results demonstrate that RoT improves the robustness and interpretability of CoT reasoning while offering fine-grained control over the reasoning process.|Lijie Hu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03595)|null|
|**2024-10-04**|**Look Twice Before You Answer: Memory-Space Visual Retracing for Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models**|Despite their impressive capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations, especially assertively fabricating content not present in the visual inputs. To address the aforementioned challenge, we follow a common cognitive process - when one's initial memory of critical on-sight details fades, it is intuitive to look at them a second time to seek a factual and accurate answer. Therefore, we introduce Memory-space Visual Retracing (MemVR), a novel hallucination mitigation paradigm that without the need for external knowledge retrieval or additional fine-tuning. In particular, we treat visual prompts as supplementary evidence to be reinjected into MLLMs via Feed Forward Network (FFN) as key-value memory, when the model is uncertain or even amnesic about question-relevant visual memories. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that MemVR significantly mitigates hallucination issues across various MLLMs and excels in general benchmarks without incurring added time overhead, thus emphasizing its potential for widespread applicability.|Xin Zou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03577)|null|

TableQA research has focused primarily on high-resource languages, leaving medium- and low-resource languages with little progress due to scarcity of annotated data and neural models. We address this gap by introducing a fully automatic large-scale tableQA data generation process for low-resource languages with limited budget. We incorporate our data generation method on two Indic languages, Bengali and Hindi, which have no tableQA datasets or models. TableQA models trained on our large-scale datasets outperform state-of-the-art LLMs. We further study the trained models on different aspects, including mathematical reasoning capabilities and zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. Our work is the first on low-resource tableQA focusing on scalable data generation and evaluation procedures. Our proposed data generation method can be applied to any low-resource language with a web presence.

Although current image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods are generally effective, they tend to face two challenges: \textbf{1)} black-box nature with unknown detection principle, \textbf{2)} limited generalization across diverse tampering methods (e.g., Photoshop, DeepFake, AIGC-Editing). To address these issues, we propose the explainable IFDL task and design FakeShield, a multi-modal framework capable of evaluating image authenticity, generating tampered region masks, and providing a judgment basis based on pixel-level and image-level tampering clues. Additionally, we leverage GPT-4o to enhance existing IFDL datasets, creating the Multi-Modal Tamper Description dataSet (MMTD-Set) for training FakeShield's tampering analysis capabilities. Meanwhile, we incorporate a Domain Tag-guided Explainable Forgery Detection Module (DTE-FDM) and a Multi-modal Forgery Localization Module (MFLM) to address various types of tamper detection interpretation and achieve forgery localization guided by detailed textual descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FakeShield effectively detects and localizes various tampering techniques, offering an explainable and superior solution compared to previous IFDL methods.|Zhipei Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02761)|null|
|**2024-10-03**|**Loong: Generating Minute-level Long Videos with Autoregressive Language Models**|It is desirable but challenging to generate content-rich long videos in the scale of minutes. Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in generating coherent and long sequences of tokens in the domain of natural language processing, while the exploration of autoregressive LLMs for video generation is limited to generating short videos of several seconds. In this work, we conduct a deep analysis of the challenges that prevent autoregressive LLM-based video generators from generating long videos. Based on the observations and analysis, we propose Loong, a new autoregressive LLM-based video generator that can generate minute-long videos. Specifically, we model the text tokens and video tokens as a unified sequence for autoregressive LLMs and train the model from scratch. We propose progressive short-to-long training with a loss re-weighting scheme to mitigate the loss imbalance problem for long video training. We further investigate inference strategies, including video token re-encoding and sampling strategies, to diminish error accumulation during inference. Our proposed Loong can be trained on 10-second videos and be extended to generate minute-level long videos conditioned on text prompts, as demonstrated by the results.

|**2024-10-03**|**SIEVE: General Purpose Data Filtering System Matching GPT-4o Accuracy at 1% the Cost**|Creating specialized large language models requires vast amounts of clean, special purpose data for training and fine-tuning. With only a handful of existing large-scale, domain-specific datasets, creation of new datasets is required in most applications. This requires the development of new application-specific filtering of web-scale data. Filtering with a high-performance, general-purpose LLM such as GPT-4o can be highly effective, but this is extremely expensive at web-scale. This paper proposes SIEVE, a lightweight alternative that matches GPT-4o accuracy at a fraction of the cost. SIEVE can perform up to 500 filtering operations for the cost of one GPT-4o filtering call. The key to SIEVE is a seamless integration of GPT-4o and lightweight T5 models, using active learning to fine-tune T5 in the background with a small number of calls to GPT-4o. Once trained, it performs as well as GPT-4o at a tiny fraction of the cost. We experimentally validate SIEVE on the OpenWebText dataset, using five highly customized filter tasks targeting high quality and domain-specific content. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in curating large, high-quality datasets for language model training at a substantially lower cost (1%) than existing techniques. To further validate SIEVE, experiments show that SIEVE and GPT-4o achieve similar accuracy, with human evaluators preferring SIEVE's filtering results to those of GPT-4o.|Jifan Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02755)|null|
|**2024-10-03**|**Training Language Models on Synthetic Edit Sequences Improves Code Synthesis**|Software engineers mainly write code by editing existing programs. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) autoregressively synthesize programs in a single pass. One explanation for this is the scarcity of open-sourced edit data. While high-quality instruction data for code synthesis is already scarce, high-quality edit data is even scarcer. To fill this gap, we develop a synthetic data generation algorithm called LintSeq. This algorithm refactors existing code into a sequence of code edits by using a linter to procedurally sample across the error-free insertions that can be used to sequentially write programs. It outputs edit sequences as text strings consisting of consecutive program diffs. To test LintSeq, we use it to refactor a dataset of instruction + program pairs into instruction + program-diff-sequence tuples. Then, we instruction finetune a series of smaller LLMs ranging from 2.6B to 14B parameters on both the re-factored and original versions of this dataset, comparing zero-shot performance on code synthesis benchmarks. We show that during repeated sampling, edit sequence finetuned models produce more diverse programs than baselines. This results in better inference-time scaling for benchmark coverage as a function of samples, i.e. the fraction of problems "pass@k" solved by any attempt given "k" tries. For example, on HumanEval pass@50, small LLMs finetuned on synthetic edit sequences are competitive with GPT-4 and outperform models finetuned on the baseline dataset by +20% (+/-3%) in absolute score. Finally, we also pretrain our own tiny LMs for code understanding. We show that finetuning tiny models on synthetic code edits results in state-of-the-art code synthesis for the on-device model class. Our 150M parameter edit sequence LM matches or outperforms code models with twice as many parameters, both with and without repeated sampling, including Codex and AlphaCode.|Ulyana Piterbarg et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02749)|null|

However, crafting effective prompts that guide LLMs to generate summaries with the appropriate level of detail and writing style remains a challenge. In this paper, we explore the use of salient information extracted from the source document to enhance summarization prompts. We show that adding keyphrases in prompts can improve ROUGE F1 and recall, making the generated summaries more similar to the reference and more complete. The number of keyphrases can control the precision-recall trade-off. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that incorporating phrase-level salient information is superior to word- or sentence-level. However, the impact on hallucination is not universally positive across LLMs. To conduct this analysis, we introduce Keyphrase Signal Extractor (CriSPO), a lightweight model that can be finetuned to extract salient keyphrases. By using CriSPO, we achieve consistent ROUGE improvements across datasets and open-weight and proprietary LLMs without any LLM customization.

|**2024-10-03**|**Contrastive Localized Language-Image Pre-Training**|Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has been a celebrated method for training vision encoders to generate image/text representations facilitating various applications. Recently, CLIP has been widely adopted as the vision backbone of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to connect image inputs for language interactions. The success of CLIP as a vision-language foundation model relies on aligning web-crawled noisy text annotations at image levels. Nevertheless, such criteria may become insufficient for downstream tasks in need of fine-grained vision representations, especially when region-level understanding is demanding for MLLMs. In this paper, we improve the localization capability of CLIP with several advances. We propose a pre-training method called Contrastive Localized Language-Image Pre-training (CLOC) by complementing CLIP with region-text contrastive loss and modules. We formulate a new concept, promptable embeddings, of which the encoder produces image embeddings easy to transform into region representations given spatial hints. To support large-scale pre-training, we design a visually-enriched and spatially-localized captioning framework to effectively generate region-text pseudo-labels at scale. By scaling up to billions of annotated images, CLOC enables high-quality regional embeddings for image region recognition and retrieval tasks, and can be a drop-in replacement of CLIP to enhance MLLMs, especially on referring and grounding tasks.|Hong-You Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02746)|null|
|**2024-10-03**|**Neutral residues: revisiting adapters for model extension**|We address the problem of extending a pretrained large language model to a new domain that was not seen at training time, like adding a language for which the original model has seen no or little training data. Popular solutions like fine-tuning or low-rank adaptation are successful at domain adaptation, but formally they do not add any extra capacity and degrade the performance in the original domain.   Our paper analyzes this extension problem under three angles: data, architecture and training procedure, which are advantageously considered jointly. In particular, we improve adapters and make it possible to learn an entire new language while ensuring that the output of the neural network is almost unchanged in the original domain. For this purpose, we modify the new residual blocks in a way that leads each new residual block to output near-zeros in the original domain.   This solution of neutral residues, which borrows architectural components from mixture of experts, is effective: with only 20% extra learnable weights compared to an original model trained on English, we get results that are significantly better than concurrent approaches (fine-tuning, low-rank or vanilla adapters) in terms of the trade-off between learning a new language and not forgetting English.|Franck Signe Talla et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02744)|null|
|**2024-10-03**|**MA-RLHF: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Macro Actions**|Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated effectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, token-level RLHF suffers from the credit assignment problem over long sequences, where delayed rewards make it challenging for the model to discern which actions contributed to successful outcomes. This hinders learning efficiency and slows convergence. In this paper, we propose MA-RLHF, a simple yet effective RLHF framework that incorporates macro actions -- sequences of tokens or higher-level language constructs -- into the learning process. By operating at this higher level of abstraction, our approach reduces the temporal distance between actions and rewards, facilitating faster and more accurate credit assignment. This results in more stable policy gradient estimates and enhances learning efficiency within each episode, all without increasing computational complexity during training or inference. We validate our approach through extensive experiments across various model sizes and tasks, including text summarization, dialogue generation, question answering, and program synthesis. Our method achieves substantial performance improvements over standard RLHF, with performance gains of up to 30% in text summarization and code generation, 18% in dialogue, and 8% in question answering tasks. Notably, our approach reaches parity with vanilla RLHF 1.7x to 2x faster in terms of training time and continues to outperform it with further training.

GLIMO incorporates an LLM agent-based data generator to automatically create high-quality and diverse instruction datasets. The generator includes an iterative self-refining module for temporally consistent experience sampling, a diverse set of question-answering instruction seeds, and a retrieval-augmented generation module for reflecting on prior experiences. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach improve the performance of strong open-source LLMs like LLaMA-3 with a performance boost of 2.04 $\times$, 1.54 $\times$, and 1.82 $\times$ across three different benchmarks, respectively.

|**2024-10-02**|**Locret: Enhancing Eviction in Long-Context LLM Inference with Trained Retaining Heads**|Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in supporting long-context comprehension and processing tasks. However, scaling the generation inference of LLMs to such long contexts incurs significant additional computation load, and demands a substantial GPU memory footprint to maintain the key-value (KV) cache of transformer-based LLMs. Existing KV cache compression methods, such as quantization, face memory bottlenecks as context length increases, while static-sized caches, such as eviction, suffer from inefficient policies. These limitations restrict deployment on consumer-grade devices like a single Nvidia 4090 GPU. To overcome this, we propose Locret, a framework for long-context LLM inference that introduces retaining heads to evaluate the causal importance of KV cache units, allowing for more accurate eviction within a fixed cache size. Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen backbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT datasets. During inference, we evict low-importance cache units along with a chunked prefill pattern, significantly reducing peak GPU memory usage. We conduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate Locret, where the experimental results show that Locret outperforms the recent competitive approaches, including InfLLM, Quantization, SirLLM, and MInference, in terms of memory efficiency and the quality of generated contents -- Locret achieves over a 20x and 8x KV cache compression ratio compared to the full KV cache for Phi-3-mini-128K and Llama-3.1-8B-instruct. Additionally, Locret can be combined with other methods, such as quantization and token merging. To our knowledge, Locret is the first framework capable of deploying Llama-3.1-8B or similar models on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, enabling 128K long-context inference without compromising generation quality, and requiring little additional system optimizations.|Yuxiang Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01805)|**[link](https://github.com/huangyuxiang03/Locret)**|
|**2024-10-02**|**Efficient $1$-bit tensor approximations**|We present a spatially efficient decomposition of matrices and arbitrary-order tensors as linear combinations of tensor products of $\{-1, 1\}$-valued vectors. For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, $$A - R_w = S_w C_w T_w^\top = \sum_{j=1}^w c_j \cdot \mathbf{s}_j \mathbf{t}_j^\top$$ is a {\it $w$-width signed cut decomposition of $A$}. Here $C_w = "diag"(\mathbf{c}_w)$ for some $\mathbf{c}_w \in \mathbb{R}^w,$ and $S_w, T_w$, and the vectors $\mathbf{s}_j, \mathbf{t}_j$ are $\{-1, 1\}$-valued. To store $(S_w, T_w, C_w)$, we may pack $w \cdot (m + n)$ bits, and require only $w$ floating point numbers. As a function of $w$, $\|R_w\|_F$ exhibits exponential decay when applied to #f32 matrices with i.i.d. $\mathcal N (0, 1)$ entries. Choosing $w$ so that $(S_w, T_w, C_w)$ has the same memory footprint as a \textit{f16} or \textit{bf16} matrix, the relative error is comparable. Our algorithm yields efficient signed cut decompositions in $20$ lines of pseudocode. It reflects a simple modification from a celebrated 1999 paper [1] of Frieze and Kannan. As a first application, we approximate the weight matrices in the open \textit{Mistral-7B-v0.1} Large Language Model to a $50\%$ spatial compression. Remarkably, all $226$ remainder matrices have a relative error $<6\%$ and the expanded model closely matches \textit{Mistral-7B-v0.1} on the {\it huggingface} leaderboard [2]. Benchmark performance degrades slowly as we reduce the spatial compression from $50\%$ to $25\%$ .

|**2024-10-02**|**Knowledge-Driven Feature Selection and Engineering for Genotype Data with Large Language Models**|Predicting phenotypes with complex genetic bases based on a small, interpretable set of variant features remains a challenging task. Conventionally, data-driven approaches are utilized for this task, yet the high dimensional nature of genotype data makes the analysis and prediction difficult. Motivated by the extensive knowledge encoded in pre-trained LLMs and their success in processing complex biomedical concepts, we set to examine the ability of LLMs in feature selection and engineering for tabular genotype data, with a novel knowledge-driven framework. We develop FREEFORM, Free-flow Reasoning and Ensembling for Enhanced Feature Output and Robust Modeling, designed with chain-of-thought and ensembling principles, to select and engineer features with the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs. Evaluated on two distinct genotype-phenotype datasets, genetic ancestry and hereditary hearing loss, we find this framework outperforms several data-driven methods, particularly on low-shot regimes.

|**2024-10-02**|**When a language model is optimized for reasoning, does it still show embers of autoregression? An analysis of OpenAI o1**|In "Embers of Autoregression" (McCoy et al., 2023), we showed that several large language models (LLMs) have some important limitations that are attributable to their origins in next-word prediction. Here we investigate whether these issues persist with o1, a new system from OpenAI that differs from previous LLMs in that it is optimized for reasoning. We find that o1 substantially outperforms previous LLMs in many cases, with particularly large improvements on rare variants of common tasks (e.g., forming acronyms from the second letter of each word in a list, rather than the first letter). Despite these quantitative improvements, however, o1 still displays the same qualitative trends that we observed in previous systems. Specifically, o1 - like previous LLMs - is sensitive to the probability of examples and tasks, performing better and requiring fewer "thinking tokens" in high-probability settings than in low-probability ones. These results show that optimizing a language model for reasoning can mitigate but might not fully overcome the language model's probability sensitivity.|R.

We present DreamGarden, an AI system capable of assisting with the development of diverse game environments in Unreal Engine. At the core of our method is an LLM-driven planner, capable of breaking down a single, high-level prompt -- a dream, memory, or imagined scenario provided by a human user -- into a hierarchical action plan, which is then distributed across specialized submodules facilitating concrete implementation. This system is presented to the user as a garden of plans and actions, both growing independently and responding to user intervention via seed prompts, pruning, and feedback. Through a user study, we explore design implications of this system, charting courses for future work in semi-autonomous assistants and open-ended simulation design.|Sam Earle et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01791)|null|

The code of nature, hidden in diverse genomes since the very beginning of life's evolution, holds immense potential for impacting humans and ecosystems through genome modeling. Recent breakthroughs in GFMs, such as Evo, have attracted significant investment and attention to genomic modeling, as they address long-standing challenges and transform in-silico genomic studies into automated, reliable, and efficient paradigms. In the context of this flourishing era of consecutive technological revolutions in genomics, GFM studies face two major challenges: the lack of GFM benchmarking tools and the absence of open-source software for diverse genomics. These challenges hinder the rapid evolution of GFMs and their wide application in tasks such as understanding and synthesizing genomes, problems that have persisted for decades. To address these challenges, we introduce GFMBench, a framework dedicated to GFM-oriented benchmarking. GFMBench standardizes benchmark suites and automates benchmarking for a wide range of open-source GFMs. It integrates millions of genomic sequences across hundreds of genomic tasks from four large-scale benchmarks, democratizing GFMs for a wide range of in-silico genomic applications. Additionally, GFMBench is released as open-source software, offering user-friendly interfaces and diverse tutorials, applicable for AutoBench and complex tasks like RNA design and structure prediction. To facilitate further advancements in genome modeling, we have launched a public leaderboard showcasing the benchmark performance derived from AutoBench.

Open-RAG uniquely trains the model to navigate challenging distractors that appear relevant but are misleading. As a result, Open-RAG leverages latent learning, dynamically selecting relevant experts and integrating external knowledge effectively for more accurate and contextually relevant responses. In addition, we propose a hybrid adaptive retrieval method to determine retrieval necessity and balance the trade-off between performance gain and inference speed. Experimental results show that the Llama2-7B-based Open-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs and RAG models such as ChatGPT, Self-RAG, and Command R+ in various knowledge-intensive tasks.

|**2024-10-02**|**DeFine: Enhancing LLM Decision-Making with Factor Profiles and Analogical Reasoning**|LLMs are ideal for decision-making due to their ability to reason over long contexts and identify critical factors. However, challenges arise when processing transcripts of spoken speech describing complex scenarios. These transcripts often contain ungrammatical or incomplete sentences, repetitions, hedging, and vagueness. For example, during a company's earnings call, an executive might project a positive revenue outlook to reassure investors, despite significant uncertainty regarding future earnings. It is crucial for LLMs to incorporate this uncertainty systematically when making decisions. In this paper, we introduce DeFine, a new framework that constructs probabilistic factor profiles from complex scenarios. DeFine then integrates these profiles with analogical reasoning, leveraging insights from similar past experiences to guide LLMs in making critical decisions in novel situations. Our framework separates the tasks of quantifying uncertainty in complex scenarios and incorporating it into LLM decision-making. This approach is particularly useful in fields such as medical consultations, negotiations, and political debates, where making decisions under uncertainty is vital.|Yebowen Hu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01772)|null|
|**2024-10-03**|**Quantifying Generalization Complexity for Large Language Models**|While large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in understanding complex queries and performing sophisticated tasks, their generalization abilities are often deeply entangled with memorization, necessitating more precise evaluation. To address this challenge, we introduce Scylla, a dynamic evaluation framework that quantitatively measures the generalization abilities of LLMs. Scylla disentangles generalization from memorization via assessing model performance on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data through 20 tasks across 5 levels of complexity. Through extensive experiments, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship between task complexity and the performance gap between ID and OOD data, which we term the generalization valley. Specifically, this phenomenon reveals a critical threshold - referred to as critical complexity - where reliance on non-generalizable behavior peaks, indicating the upper bound of LLMs' generalization capabilities. As model size increases, the critical complexity shifts toward higher levels of task complexity, suggesting that larger models can handle more complex reasoning tasks before over-relying on memorization. Leveraging Scylla and the concept of critical complexity, we benchmark 28LLMs including both open-sourced models such as LLaMA and Qwen families, and close-sourced models like Claude and GPT, providing a more robust evaluation and establishing a clearer understanding of LLMs' generalization capabilities.|Zhenting Qi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01769)|null|

We demonstrate that the proposed evaluators are robust against adversarial attacks, including the assessment of non-argumentative text. Additionally, the human-crafted arguments needed to train the evaluators are minimized to just one example per Proxy Task. By examining multiple LLM-generated arguments, we establish a methodology for determining whether a Proxy Task is suitable for evaluating LLM-generated medical explanatory arguments, requiring only five examples and two human experts.|Iker De la Iglesia et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20565)|null|
|**2024-09-30**|**Propose, Assess, Search: Harnessing LLMs for Goal-Oriented Planning in Instructional Videos**|Goal-oriented planning, or anticipating a series of actions that transition an agent from its current state to a predefined objective, is crucial for developing intelligent assistants aiding users in daily procedural tasks. The problem presents significant challenges due to the need for comprehensive knowledge of temporal and hierarchical task structures, as well as strong capabilities in reasoning and planning. To achieve this, prior work typically relies on extensive training on the target dataset, which often results in significant dataset bias and a lack of generalization to unseen tasks. In this work, we introduce VidAssist, an integrated framework designed for zero/few-shot goal-oriented planning in instructional videos. VidAssist leverages large language models (LLMs) as both the knowledge base and the assessment tool for generating and evaluating action plans, thus overcoming the challenges of acquiring procedural knowledge from small-scale, low-diversity datasets. Moreover, VidAssist employs a breadth-first search algorithm for optimal plan generation, in which a composite of value functions designed for goal-oriented planning is utilized to assess the predicted actions at each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VidAssist offers a unified framework for different goal-oriented planning setups, e.g., visual planning for assistance (VPA) and procedural planning (PP), and achieves remarkable performance in zero-shot and few-shot setups. Specifically, our few-shot model outperforms the prior fully supervised state-of-the-art method by +7.7% in VPA and +4.81% PP task on the COIN dataset while predicting 4 future actions.

Recent large language models (LLMs) based approaches have shown promising results and revolutionized code generation task. Despite the promising performance, LLMs often generate contents with hallucinations, especially for the code generation scenario requiring the handling of complex contextual dependencies in practical development process. Although previous study has analyzed hallucinations in LLM-powered code generation, the study is limited to standalone function generation. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to study the phenomena, mechanism, and mitigation of LLM hallucinations within more practical and complex development contexts in repository-level generation scenario. First, we manually examine the code generation results from six mainstream LLMs to establish a hallucination taxonomy of LLM-generated code. Next, we elaborate on the phenomenon of hallucinations, analyze their distribution across different models. We then analyze causes of hallucinations and identify four potential factors contributing to hallucinations. Finally, we propose an RAG-based mitigation method, which demonstrates consistent effectiveness in all studied LLMs. The replication package including code, data, and experimental results is available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/LLMCodingHallucination|Ziyao Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20550)|null|

Building on the advanced communication interfaces, Robi Butler allows users to monitor the robot's status, send text or voice instructions, and select target objects by hand pointing. At the core of our system is a high-level behavior module, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), that interprets multimodal instructions to generate action plans. These plans are composed of a set of open vocabulary primitives supported by Vision Language Models (VLMs) that handle both text and pointing queries. The integration of the above components allows Robi Butler to ground remote multimodal instructions in the real-world home environment in a zero-shot manner.

This paper presents a novel framework that combines an automated data extraction using language models, and an uncertainty-informed prediction model to fill data gaps and improve prediction confidence. First, we have utilized and compared two approaches to automatically extract relevant data from a corpus of scientific literature on solvents used in perovskite synthesis: smaller bidirectional language models like BERT and ELMo are used for their repeatability and deterministic outputs, while autoregressive large language model (LLM) such as GPT-3.5 is used to leverage its larger training corpus and better response generation. Our novel 'prompting and verification' technique integrated with an LLM aims at targeted extraction and refinement, thereby reducing hallucination and improving the quality of the extracted data using the LLM. Next, the extracted data is fed into our pre-trained multi-task binary classification deep learning to predict the ED nature of extracted solvents. We have used a Shannon entropy-based uncertainty quantification utilizing the class probabilities obtained from the classification model to quantify uncertainty and identify data gaps in our predictions. This approach leads to the curation of a structured dataset for solvents used in perovskite synthesis and their uncertainty-informed virtual toxicity assessment. Additionally, chord diagrams have been used to visualize solvent interactions and prioritize those with potential hazards, revealing that 70% of the solvent interactions were primarily associated with two specific perovskites.|Arpan Mukherjee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20512)|null|

The hierarchical VQ-VAE architecture captures different motion-specific characteristics at multiple levels of abstraction, avoiding redundant concepts and enabling efficient multi-resolution representation. We introduce a diffusion model that operates in the latent space and incorporates LLM-generated motion planning cues to guide the denoising process, resulting in prompt-specific motion generation with greater control and diversity. Experimental results on the CORE-4D, and InterHuman datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating realistic and diverse collaborative human-object-human interactions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

|**2024-10-01**|**Instance-adaptive Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought Prompting**|Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting emerges as a simple and effective strategy for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in real-world reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, the efficacy of a singular, task-level prompt uniformly applied across the whole of instances is inherently limited since one prompt cannot be a good partner for all, a more appropriate approach should consider the interaction between the prompt and each instance meticulously. This work introduces an instance-adaptive prompting algorithm as an alternative zero-shot CoT reasoning scheme by adaptively differentiating good and bad prompts. Concretely, we first employ analysis on LLMs through the lens of information flow to detect the mechanism under zero-shot CoT reasoning, in which we discover that information flows from question to prompt and question to rationale jointly influence the reasoning results most. We notice that a better zero-shot CoT reasoning needs the prompt to obtain semantic information from the question then the rationale aggregates sufficient information from the question directly and via the prompt indirectly. On the contrary, lacking any of those would probably lead to a bad one. Stem from that, we further propose an instance-adaptive prompting strategy (IAP) for zero-shot CoT reasoning. Experiments conducted with LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and Qwen on math, logic, and commonsense reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K, MMLU, Causal Judgement) obtain consistent improvement, demonstrating that the instance-adaptive zero-shot CoT prompting performs better than other task-level methods with some curated prompts or sophisticated procedures, showing the significance of our findings in the zero-shot CoT reasoning mechanism.|Xiaosong Yuan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20441)|null|

Specifically, QAEncoder estimates the expectation of potential queries in the embedding space as a robust surrogate for the document embedding, and attaches document fingerprints to effectively distinguish these embeddings.

|**2024-09-27**|**LML: Language Model Learning a Dataset for Data-Augmented Prediction**|This paper introduces a new approach to using Large Language Models (LLMs) for classification tasks, which are typically handled using Machine Learning (ML) models. Unlike ML models that rely heavily on data cleaning and feature engineering, this method streamlines the process using LLMs. This paper proposes a new concept called "Language Model Learning (LML)" powered by a new method called "Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP)". The classification is performed by LLMs using a method similar to humans manually exploring and understanding the data and deciding classifications using data as a reference. Training data is summarized and evaluated to determine the features that lead to the classification of each label the most. In the process of DAP, the system uses the data summary to automatically create a query, which is used to retrieve relevant rows from the dataset. A classification is generated by the LLM using data summary and relevant rows, ensuring satisfactory accuracy even with complex data. Usage of data summary and similar data in DAP ensures context-aware decision-making. The proposed method uses the words "Act as an Explainable Machine Learning Model" in the prompt to enhance the interpretability of the predictions by allowing users to review the logic behind each prediction. In some test cases, the system scored an accuracy above 90%, proving the effectiveness of the system and its potential to outperform conventional ML models in various scenarios.

However, when required to generate responses of a specific length, large language models often struggle to meet users' needs due to their inherent difficulty in accurately perceiving numerical constraints. To explore the ability of large language models to control the length of generated responses, we propose the Target Length Generation Task (TLG) and design two metrics, Precise Match (PM) and Flexible Match (FM) to evaluate the model's performance in adhering to specified response lengths. Furthermore, we introduce a novel, model-agnostic approach called Ruler, which employs Meta Length Tokens (MLTs) to enhance the instruction-following ability of large language models under length-constrained instructions. Specifically, Ruler equips LLMs with the ability to generate responses of a specified length based on length constraints within the instructions. Moreover, Ruler can automatically generate appropriate MLT when length constraints are not explicitly provided, demonstrating excellent versatility and generalization. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of Ruler across different LLMs on Target Length Generation Task, e.g., at All Level 27.97 average gain on PM, 29.57 average gain on FM.

In this survey, we aim to trace and summarize the advancements of MM-LLMs from image understanding to long video understanding. We review the differences among various visual understanding tasks and highlight the challenges in long video understanding, including more fine-grained spatiotemporal details, dynamic events, and long-term dependencies. We then provide a detailed summary of the advancements in MM-LLMs in terms of model design and training methodologies for understanding long videos.

Large Language Models (LLM) could advance simulated patient systems by replicating medical conditions and patient-doctor interactions with high fidelity and low cost. However, ensuring the effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems remains a challenge, as they require a large, diverse, and precise patient knowledgebase, along with a robust and stable knowledge diffusion to users. Here, we developed AIPatient, an advanced simulated patient system with AIPatient Knowledge Graph (AIPatient KG) as the input and the Reasoning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Reasoning RAG) agentic workflow as the generation backbone. AIPatient KG samples data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database, producing a clinically diverse and relevant cohort of 1,495 patients with high knowledgebase validity (F1 0.89). Reasoning RAG leverages six LLM powered agents spanning tasks including retrieval, KG query generation, abstraction, checker, rewrite, and summarization. This agentic framework reaches an overall accuracy of 94.15% in EHR-based medical Question Answering (QA), outperforming benchmarks that use either no agent or only partial agent integration. Our system also presents high readability (median Flesch Reading Ease 77.23; median Flesch Kincaid Grade 5.6), robustness (ANOVA F-value 0.6126, p<0.1), and stability (ANOVA F-value 0.782, p<0.1).

Item Discrimination (ID) theory, which is widely used in educational assessment, measures the ability of individual test items to differentiate between high and low performers. Inspired by this theory, we propose an ID-induced prompt synthesis framework for evaluating LLMs to ensure the evaluation set can continually update and refine according to model abilities. Our data synthesis framework prioritizes both breadth and specificity. It can generate prompts that comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs while revealing meaningful performance differences between models, allowing for effective discrimination of their relative strengths and weaknesses across various tasks and domains. To produce high-quality data, we incorporate a self-correct mechanism into our generalization framework, and develop two models to predict prompt discrimination and difficulty score to facilitate our data synthesis framework, contributing valuable tools to evaluation data synthesis research. We apply our generated data to evaluate five SOTA models. Our data achieves an average score of 51.92, accompanied by a variance of 10.06. By contrast, previous works (i.e., SELF-INSTRUCT and WizardLM) obtain an average score exceeding 67, with a variance below 3.2. The results demonstrate that the data generated by our framework is more challenging and discriminative compared to previous works.

In this paper, we introduce Emu3, a new suite of state-of-the-art multimodal models trained solely with next-token prediction. By tokenizing images, text, and videos into a discrete space, we train a single transformer from scratch on a mixture of multimodal sequences. Emu3 outperforms several well-established task-specific models in both generation and perception tasks, surpassing flagship models such as SDXL and LLaVA-1.6, while eliminating the need for diffusion or compositional architectures. Emu3 is also capable of generating high-fidelity video via predicting the next token in a video sequence. We simplify complex multimodal model designs by converging on a singular focus: tokens, unlocking great potential for scaling both during training and inference.

|**2024-09-27**|**Predicting and analyzing memorization within fine-tuned Large Language Models**|Large Language Models have received significant attention due to their abilities to solve a wide range of complex tasks. However these models memorize a significant proportion of their training data, posing a serious threat when disclosed at inference time. To mitigate this unintended memorization, it is crucial to understand what elements are memorized and why. Most existing works provide a posteriori explanations, which has a limited interest in practice. To address this gap, we propose a new approach based on sliced mutual information to detect memorized samples a priori, in a classification setting. It is efficient from the early stages of training, and is readily adaptable to practical scenarios. Our method is supported by new theoretical results that we demonstrate, and requires a low computational budget. We obtain strong empirical results, paving the way for systematic inspection and protection of these vulnerable samples before memorization happens.|Jérémie Dentan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18858)|null|
|**2024-09-27**|**Mitigating Selection Bias with Node Pruning and Auxiliary Options**|Large language models (LLMs) often show unwarranted preference for certain choice options when responding to multiple-choice questions, posing significant reliability concerns in LLM-automated systems. To mitigate this selection bias problem, previous solutions utilized debiasing methods to adjust the model's input and/or output. Our work, in contrast, investigates the model's internal representation of the selection bias. Specifically, we introduce a novel debiasing approach, Bias Node Pruning (BNP), which eliminates the linear layer parameters that contribute to the bias. Furthermore, we present Auxiliary Option Injection (AOI), a simple yet effective input modification technique for debiasing, which is compatible even with black-box LLMs. To provide a more systematic evaluation of selection bias, we review existing metrics and introduce Choice Kullback-Leibler Divergence (CKLD), which addresses the insensitivity of the commonly used metrics to label imbalance. Experiments show that our methods are robust and adaptable across various datasets when applied to three LLMs.|Hyeong Kyu Choi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18857)|null|

This framework addresses the need for rapid, coherent, and contextually rich integration of scientific insights, leveraging both open-source and proprietary LLMs. It also examines the effectiveness of LLMs in evaluating the integrity and reliability of these syntheses, alleviating inadequacies in current quantitative metrics. Our study contributes to this field by developing a novel methodology for processing scientific papers, defining new synthesis types, and establishing nine detailed quality criteria for evaluating syntheses. The integration of LLMs with reinforcement learning and AI feedback is proposed to optimize synthesis quality, ensuring alignment with established criteria.

In this work, we present EgoLM, a versatile framework that tracks and understands egocentric motions from multi-modal inputs, e.g., egocentric videos and motion sensors. EgoLM exploits rich contexts for the disambiguation of egomotion tracking and understanding, which are ill-posed under single modality conditions. To facilitate the versatile and multi-modal framework, our key insight is to model the joint distribution of egocentric motions and natural languages using large language models (LLM). Multi-modal sensor inputs are encoded and projected to the joint latent space of language models, and used to prompt motion generation or text generation for egomotion tracking or understanding, respectively. Extensive experiments on large-scale multi-modal human motion dataset validate the effectiveness of EgoLM as a generalist model for universal egocentric learning.|Fangzhou Hong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18127)|null|

Due to these restrictions, existing CLIP applications in medical imaging focus mainly on modalities like chest X-rays that have abundant image-report data available, leaving many other important modalities under-explored. Here, we propose the first adaptation of the full CLIP model to mammography, which presents significant challenges due to labeled data scarcity, high-resolution images with small regions of interest, and data imbalance. We first develop a specialized supervision framework for mammography that leverages its multi-view nature. Furthermore, we design a symmetric local alignment module to better focus on detailed features in high-resolution images. Lastly, we incorporate a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for large language models pre-trained with medical knowledge to address data limitations. Our multi-view and multi-scale alignment (MaMA) method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for three different tasks on two large real-world mammography datasets, EMBED and RSNA-Mammo, with only 52% model size compared with the largest baseline.|Yuexi Du et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18119)|null|

Bench: Towards Open-Ended Event-Level Video-Language Understanding**|Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated their great potential in general-purpose video understanding. To verify the significance of these models, a number of benchmarks have been proposed to diagnose their capabilities in different scenarios. However, existing benchmarks merely evaluate models through video-level question-answering, lacking fine-grained event-level assessment and task diversity. To fill this gap, we introduce E.T. Bench (Event-Level & Time-Sensitive Video Understanding Benchmark), a large-scale and high-quality benchmark for open-ended event-level video understanding. Categorized within a 3-level task taxonomy, E.T. Bench encompasses 7.3K samples under 12 tasks with 7K videos (251.4h total length) under 8 domains, providing comprehensive evaluations. We extensively evaluated 8 Image-LLMs and 12 Video-LLMs on our benchmark, and the results reveal that state-of-the-art models for coarse-level (video-level) understanding struggle to solve our fine-grained tasks, e.g., grounding event-of-interests within videos, largely due to the short video context length, improper time representations, and lack of multi-event training data. Focusing on these issues, we further propose a strong baseline model, E.T. Chat, together with an instruction-tuning dataset E.T. Instruct 164K tailored for fine-grained event-level understanding. Our simple but effective solution demonstrates superior performance in multiple scenarios.|Ye Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18111)|**[link](https://github.com/PolyU-ChenLab/ETBench)**|

User interface icons are essential for navigation and interaction and often lack meaningful alt-text, creating barriers to effective use. Traditional deep learning approaches for generating alt-text require extensive datasets and struggle with the diversity and imbalance of icon types. More recent Vision Language Models (VLMs) require complete UI screens, which can be impractical during the iterative phases of app development. To address these issues, we introduce a novel method using Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously generate informative alt-text for mobile UI icons with partial UI data. By incorporating icon context, that include class, resource ID, bounds, OCR-detected text, and contextual information from parent and sibling nodes, we fine-tune an off-the-shelf LLM on a small dataset of approximately 1.4k icons, yielding IconDesc. In an empirical evaluation and a user study IconDesc demonstrates significant improvements in generating relevant alt-text. This ability makes IconDesc an invaluable tool for developers, aiding in the rapid iteration and enhancement of UI accessibility.|Sabrina Haque et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18060)|null|
|**2024-09-26**|**DualAD: Dual-Layer Planning for Reasoning in Autonomous Driving**|We present a novel autonomous driving framework, DualAD, designed to imitate human reasoning during driving. DualAD comprises two layers: a rule-based motion planner at the bottom layer that handles routine driving tasks requiring minimal reasoning, and an upper layer featuring a rule-based text encoder that converts driving scenarios from absolute states into text description. This text is then processed by a large language model (LLM) to make driving decisions. The upper layer intervenes in the bottom layer's decisions when potential danger is detected, mimicking human reasoning in critical situations. Closed-loop experiments demonstrate that DualAD, using a zero-shot pre-trained model, significantly outperforms rule-based motion planners that lack reasoning abilities. Our experiments also highlight the effectiveness of the text encoder, which considerably enhances the model's scenario understanding. Additionally, the integrated DualAD model improves with stronger LLMs, indicating the framework's potential for further enhancement.

However, empowering Large Language Models to perceive and generate images, texts, and speeches end-to-end with publicly available data remains challenging in the open-source community. Existing vision-language models rely on external tools for the speech processing, while speech-language models still suffer from limited or even without vision-understanding abilities. To address this gap, we propose EMOVA (EMotionally Omni-present Voice Assistant), to enable Large Language Models with end-to-end speech capabilities while maintaining the leading vision-language performance. With a semantic-acoustic disentangled speech tokenizer, we notice surprisingly that omni-modal alignment can further enhance vision-language and speech abilities compared with the corresponding bi-modal aligned counterparts. Moreover, a lightweight style module is proposed for flexible speech style controls (e.g., emotions and pitches). For the first time, EMOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the vision-language and speech benchmarks, and meanwhile, supporting omni-modal spoken dialogue with vivid emotions.|Kai Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18042)|null|
|**2024-09-26**|**Compositional Hardness of Code in Large Language Models -- A Probabilistic Perspective**|A common practice in large language model (LLM) usage for complex analytical tasks such as code generation, is to sample a solution for the entire task within the model's context window. Previous works have shown that subtask decomposition within the model's context (chain of thought), is beneficial for solving such tasks. In this work, we point a limitation of LLMs' ability to perform several sub-tasks within the same context window - an in-context hardness of composition, pointing to an advantage for distributing a decomposed problem in a multi-agent system of LLMs. The hardness of composition is quantified by a generation complexity metric, i.e., the number of LLM generations required to sample at least one correct solution. We find a gap between the generation complexity of solving a compositional problem within the same context relative to distributing it among multiple agents, that increases exponentially with the solution's length. We prove our results theoretically and demonstrate them empirically.|Yotam Wolf et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18028)|null|

Unlearning methods aim at completely removing hazardous capabilities from models and make them inaccessible to adversaries. This work challenges the fundamental differences between unlearning and traditional safety post-training from an adversarial perspective. We demonstrate that existing jailbreak methods, previously reported as ineffective against unlearning, can be successful when applied carefully. Furthermore, we develop a variety of adaptive methods that recover most supposedly unlearned capabilities. For instance, we show that finetuning on 10 unrelated examples or removing specific directions in the activation space can recover most hazardous capabilities for models edited with RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method. Our findings challenge the robustness of current unlearning approaches and question their advantages over safety training.|Jakub Łucki et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18025)|null|
|**2024-09-26**|**DARE: Diverse Visual Question Answering with Robustness Evaluation**|Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend remarkable capabilities of text-only large language models and vision-only models, and are able to learn from and process multi-modal vision-text input. While modern VLMs perform well on a number of standard image classification and image-text matching tasks, they still struggle with a number of crucial vision-language (VL) reasoning abilities such as counting and spatial reasoning. Moreover, while they might be very brittle to small variations in instructions and/or evaluation protocols, existing benchmarks fail to evaluate their robustness (or rather the lack of it). In order to couple challenging VL scenarios with comprehensive robustness evaluation, we introduce DARE, Diverse Visual Question Answering with Robustness Evaluation, a carefully created and curated multiple-choice VQA benchmark. DARE evaluates VLM performance on five diverse categories and includes four robustness-oriented evaluations based on the variations of: prompts, the subsets of answer options, the output format and the number of correct answers. Among a spectrum of other findings, we report that state-of-the-art VLMs still struggle with questions in most categories and are unable to consistently deliver their peak performance across the tested robustness evaluations. The worst case performance across the subsets of options is up to 34% below the performance in the standard case. The robustness of the open-source VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6 and Idefics2 cannot match the closed-source models such as GPT-4 and Gemini, but even the latter remain very brittle to different variations.|Hannah Sterz et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18023)|null|

To address this issue, a new paradigm named Online Long-context Processing (OLP) is proposed when we process a document of unlimited length, which typically occurs in the information reception and organization of diverse streaming media such as automated news reporting, live e-commerce, and viral short videos. Moreover, a dilemma was often encountered when we tried to select the most suitable LLM from a large number of LLMs amidst explosive growth aiming for outstanding performance, affordable prices, and short response delays. In view of this, we also develop Role Reinforcement Learning (Role-RL) to automatically deploy different LLMs in their respective roles within the OLP pipeline according to their actual performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on our OLP-MINI dataset and it is found that OLP with Role-RL framework achieves OLP benchmark with an average recall rate of 93.2% and the LLM cost saved by 79.4%.

Motivated by text prompting in LLMs, visual prompting has been explored to enhance LVLMs' capabilities of perceiving visual information. However, previous visual prompting techniques solely process visual inputs without considering text queries, limiting the models' ability to follow text instructions to complete tasks. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose a new prompting technique named Attention Prompting on Image, which just simply overlays a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image and effectively enhances LVLM on various tasks. Specifically, we generate an attention heatmap for the input image dependent on the text query with an auxiliary model like CLIP. Then the heatmap simply multiplies the pixel values of the original image to obtain the actual input image for the LVLM. Extensive experiments on various vison-language benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our technique. For example, Attention Prompting on Image improves LLaVA-1.5 by 3.8% and 2.9% on MM-Vet and LLaVA-Wild benchmarks, respectively.|Runpeng Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17143)|**[link](https://github.com/yu-rp/apiprompting)**|
|**2024-09-25**|**FineZip : Pushing the Limits of Large Language Models for Practical Lossless Text Compression**|While the language modeling objective has been shown to be deeply connected with compression, it is surprising that modern LLMs are not employed in practical text compression systems. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of neural network and transformer-based compression techniques to answer this question. We compare traditional text compression systems with neural network and LLM-based text compression methods. Although LLM-based systems significantly outperform conventional compression methods, they are highly impractical. Specifically, LLMZip, a recent text compression system using Llama3-8B requires 9.5 days to compress just 10 MB of text, although with huge improvements in compression ratios. To overcome this, we present FineZip - a novel LLM-based text compression system that combines ideas of online memorization and dynamic context to reduce the compression time immensely. FineZip can compress the above corpus in approximately 4 hours compared to 9.5 days, a 54 times improvement over LLMZip and comparable performance. FineZip outperforms traditional algorithmic compression methods with a large margin, improving compression ratios by approximately 50\%. With this work, we take the first step towards making lossless text compression with LLMs a reality. While FineZip presents a significant step in that direction, LLMs are still not a viable solution for large-scale text compression.

To address this issue, we propose AXIS, a novel LLM-based agents framework prioritize actions through application programming interfaces (APIs) over UI actions. This framework also facilitates the creation and expansion of APIs through automated exploration of applications. Our experiments on Office Word demonstrate that AXIS reduces task completion time by 65%-70% and cognitive workload by 38%-53%, while maintaining accuracy of 97%-98% compare to humans. Our work contributes to a new human-agent-computer interaction (HACI) framework and a fresh UI design principle for application providers in the era of LLMs. It also explores the possibility of turning every applications into agents, paving the way towards an agent-centric operating system (Agent OS).|Junting Lu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17140)|null|
|**2024-09-25**|**Programming Every Example: Lifting Pre-training Data Quality like Experts at Scale**|Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts to craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous rules developed to date. However, these rules lack the flexibility to address the unique characteristics of individual example effectively. Meanwhile, applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts. In this paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B parameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to those of human experts. We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel framework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to refine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as string normalization, for each individual example at scale. Experimental results show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either original data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2% across various downstream benchmarks. Its effectiveness spans various model sizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, and FineWeb. Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable to models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens. Further analysis highlights that ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for efficient LLM pre-training.We are open-sourcing ProX with >100B corpus, models, and sharing all training and implementation details for reproducible research and future innovation.

These regions emerge during training and become more defined as training progresses or model size increases. The regions appear to be much larger than previously studied polytopes. Our analysis suggests that these stable regions align with semantic distinctions, where similar prompts cluster within regions, and activations from the same region lead to similar next token predictions.

|**2024-09-25**|**Accumulator-Aware Post-Training Quantization**|Several recent studies have investigated low-precision accumulation, reporting improvements in throughput, power, and area across various platforms. However, the accompanying proposals have only considered the quantization-aware training (QAT) paradigm, in which models are fine-tuned or trained from scratch with quantization in the loop. As models continue to grow in size, QAT techniques become increasingly more expensive, which has motivated the recent surge in post-training quantization (PTQ) research. To the best of our knowledge, ours marks the first formal study of accumulator-aware quantization in the PTQ setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce AXE, a practical framework of accumulator-aware extensions designed to endow overflow avoidance guarantees to existing layer-wise PTQ algorithms. We theoretically motivate AXE and demonstrate its flexibility by implementing it on top of two state-of-the-art PTQ algorithms: GPFQ and OPTQ. We further generalize AXE to support multi-stage accumulation for the first time, opening the door for full datapath optimization and scaling to large language models (LLMs). We evaluate AXE across image classification and language generation models, and observe significant improvements in the trade-off between accumulator bit width and model accuracy over baseline methods.|Ian Colbert et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17092)|null|

However, attribution for long documents remains largely unexplored. Post-hoc attribution systems are designed to map answer text back to the source document, yet the granularity of this mapping has not been addressed. Furthermore, a critical question arises: What precisely should be attributed, with an emphasis on identifying the information units within an answer that necessitate grounding? In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel approach to the factual decomposition of generated answers for attribution, employing template-based in-context learning. To accomplish this, we utilize the question and integrate negative sampling during few-shot in-context learning for decomposition. This approach enhances the semantic understanding of both abstractive and extractive answers. We examine the impact of answer decomposition by providing a thorough examination of various attribution approaches, ranging from retrieval-based techniques to LLM-based attributors.|Pritika Ramu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17073)|null|

Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recent research has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit (even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs, and decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due to numerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weight quantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit. Recent research on Vector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremely low-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookup tables.   In this paper, we introduce Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ) for extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs. We use Second-Order Optimization to formulate the LLM VQ problem and guide our quantization algorithm design by solving the optimization. We further refine the weights using Channel-Independent Second-Order Optimization for a granular VQ. In addition, by decomposing the optimization problem, we propose a brief and effective codebook initialization algorithm. We also extend VPTQ to support residual and outlier quantization, which enhances model accuracy and further compresses the model. Our experimental results show that VPTQ reduces model quantization perplexity by $0.01$-$0.34$ on LLaMA-2, $0.38$-$0.68$ on Mistral-7B, $4.41$-$7.34$ on LLaMA-3 over SOTA at 2-bit, with an average accuracy improvement of $0.79$-$1.5\%$ on LLaMA-2, $1\%$ on Mistral-7B, $11$-$22\%$ on LLaMA-3 on QA tasks on average. We only utilize $10.4$-$18.6\%$ of the quantization algorithm execution time, resulting in a $1.6$-$1.8\times$ increase in inference throughput compared to SOTA.|Yifei Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17066)|**[link](https://github.com/microsoft/vptq)**|

Doctors need to conduct thorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition, providing treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medical records. In regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds, doctors often have to ask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process. While diagnosing is essential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI to improve time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable early diagnosis and intervention. This paper proposes a solution using a localized large language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarize doctor-patient conversations. We utilize the Whisper model for transcription and GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format. This system is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension, allowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking. By leveraging this solution for real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, doctors can improve the turnaround time for patient care while enhancing the quality of records, which become more detailed and insightful for future visits. This innovation addresses challenges like overcrowded facilities and the administrative burden on healthcare providers in Indonesia. We believe this solution will help doctors save time, provide better care, and produce more accurate medical records, representing a significant step toward modernizing healthcare and ensuring patients receive timely, high-quality care, even in resource-constrained settings.|Azmul Asmar Irfan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17054)|null|

In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation.

However, the inherent heterogeneity of these teams presents significant challenges in initial task allocation (ITA), which involves assigning the most suitable tasks to each team member based on their individual capabilities before task execution. While current learning-based methods have shown promising results, they are often computationally expensive to train, and lack the flexibility to incorporate user preferences in multi-objective optimization and adapt to last-minute changes in real-world dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose REBEL, an LLM-based ITA framework that integrates rule-based and experience-enhanced learning. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation, REBEL dynamically retrieves relevant rules and past experiences, enhancing reasoning efficiency. Additionally, REBEL can complement pre-trained RL-based ITA policies, improving situational awareness and overall team performance.

However, their widespread use raises concerns, particularly around the potential for LLMs to spread persuasive, humanlike misinformation at scale, which could significantly influence public opinion. This study examines these risks, focusing on LLMs ability to propagate misinformation as factual. To investigate this, we built the LLM Echo Chamber, a controlled digital environment simulating social media chatrooms, where misinformation often spreads. Echo chambers, where individuals only interact with like minded people, further entrench beliefs. By studying malicious bots spreading misinformation in this environment, we can better understand this phenomenon. We reviewed current LLMs, explored misinformation risks, and applied sota finetuning techniques. Using Microsoft phi2 model, finetuned with our custom dataset, we generated harmful content to create the Echo Chamber. This setup, evaluated by GPT4 for persuasiveness and harmfulness, sheds light on the ethical concerns surrounding LLMs and emphasizes the need for stronger safeguards against misinformation.|Tony Ma et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16241)|**[link](https://github.com/iamtonymwt/echo_chamber)**|

|**2024-09-24**|**Towards Enhancing Linked Data Retrieval in Conversational UIs using Large Language Models**|Despite the recent broad adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains, their potential for enriching information systems in extracting and exploring Linked Data (LD) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) triplestores has not been extensively explored. This paper examines the integration of LLMs within existing systems, emphasising the enhancement of conversational user interfaces (UIs) and their capabilities for data extraction by producing more accurate SPARQL queries without the requirement for model retraining. Typically, conversational UI models necessitate retraining with the introduction of new datasets or updates, limiting their functionality as general-purpose extraction tools. Our approach addresses this limitation by incorporating LLMs into the conversational UI workflow, significantly enhancing their ability to comprehend and process user queries effectively. By leveraging the advanced natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, our method improves RDF entity extraction within web systems employing conventional chatbots. This integration facilitates a more nuanced and context-aware interaction model, critical for handling the complex query patterns often encountered in RDF datasets and Linked Open Data (LOD) endpoints. The evaluation of this methodology shows a marked enhancement in system expressivity and the accuracy of responses to user queries, indicating a promising direction for future research in this area. This investigation not only underscores the versatility of LLMs in enhancing existing information systems but also sets the stage for further explorations into their potential applications within more specialised domains of web information systems.|Omar Mussa et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16220)|null|
|**2024-09-24**|**LLMCount: Enhancing Stationary mmWave Detection with Multimodal-LLM**|Millimeter wave sensing provides people with the capability of sensing the surrounding crowds in a non-invasive and privacy-preserving manner, which holds huge application potential. However, detecting stationary crowds remains challenging due to several factors such as minimal movements (like breathing or casual fidgets), which can be easily treated as noise clusters during data collection and consequently filtered in the following processing procedures. Additionally, the uneven distribution of signal power due to signal power attenuation and interferences resulting from external reflectors or absorbers further complicates accurate detection. To address these challenges and enable stationary crowd detection across various application scenarios requiring specialized domain adaption, we introduce LLMCount, the first system to harness the capabilities of large-language models (LLMs) to enhance crowd detection performance. By exploiting the decision-making capability of LLM, we can successfully compensate the signal power to acquire a uniform distribution and thereby achieve a detection with higher accuracy. To assess the system's performance, comprehensive evaluations are conducted under diversified scenarios like hall, meeting room, and cinema. The evaluation results show that our proposed approach reaches high detection accuracy with lower overall latency compared with previous methods.|Boyan Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16209)|null|
|**2024-09-25**|**CJEval: A Benchmark for Assessing Large Language Models Using Chinese Junior High School Exam Data**|Online education platforms have significantly transformed the dissemination of educational resources by providing a dynamic and digital infrastructure. With the further enhancement of this transformation, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has elevated the intelligence levels of these platforms. However, current academic benchmarks provide limited guidance for real-world industry scenarios. This limitation arises because educational applications require more than mere test question responses. To bridge this gap, we introduce CJEval, a benchmark based on Chinese Junior High School Exam Evaluations. CJEval consists of 26,136 samples across four application-level educational tasks covering ten subjects. These samples include not only questions and answers but also detailed annotations such as question types, difficulty levels, knowledge concepts, and answer explanations. By utilizing this benchmark, we assessed LLMs' potential applications and conducted a comprehensive analysis of their performance by fine-tuning on various educational tasks. Extensive experiments and discussions have highlighted the opportunities and challenges of applying LLMs in the field of education.|Qian-Wen Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16202)|**[link](https://github.com/smilewhc/cjeval)**|
|**2024-09-24**|**HelloBench: Evaluating Long Text Generation Capabilities of Large Language Models**|In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks (e.g., long-context understanding), and many benchmarks have been proposed. However, we observe that long text generation capabilities are not well investigated. Therefore, we introduce the Hierarchical Long Text Generation Benchmark (HelloBench), a comprehensive, in-the-wild, and open-ended benchmark to evaluate LLMs' performance in generating long text. Based on Bloom's Taxonomy, HelloBench categorizes long text generation tasks into five subtasks: open-ended QA, summarization, chat, text completion, and heuristic text generation. Besides, we propose Hierarchical Long Text Evaluation (HelloEval), a human-aligned evaluation method that significantly reduces the time and effort required for human evaluation while maintaining a high correlation with human evaluation. We have conducted extensive experiments across around 30 mainstream LLMs and observed that the current LLMs lack long text generation capabilities. Specifically, first, regardless of whether the instructions include explicit or implicit length constraints, we observe that most LLMs cannot generate text that is longer than 4000 words. Second, we observe that while some LLMs can generate longer text, many issues exist (e.g., severe repetition and quality degradation). Third, to demonstrate the effectiveness of HelloEval, we compare HelloEval with traditional metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU, etc.) and LLM-as-a-Judge methods, which show that HelloEval has the highest correlation with human evaluation. We release our code in https://github.com/Quehry/HelloBench.|Haoran Que et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16191)|**[link](https://github.com/quehry/hellobench)**|
|**2024-09-24**|**Cyber Knowledge Completion Using Large Language Models**|The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) into Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) has expanded their cyber-attack surface, introducing new and sophisticated threats with potential to exploit emerging vulnerabilities. Assessing the risks of CPSs is increasingly difficult due to incomplete and outdated cybersecurity knowledge. This highlights the urgent need for better-informed risk assessments and mitigation strategies. While previous efforts have relied on rule-based natural language processing (NLP) tools to map vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and attack patterns, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a unique opportunity to enhance cyber-attack knowledge completion through improved reasoning, inference, and summarization capabilities. We apply embedding models to encapsulate information on attack patterns and adversarial techniques, generating mappings between them using vector embeddings. Additionally, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based approach that leverages pre-trained models to create structured mappings between different taxonomies of threat patterns. Further, we use a small hand-labeled dataset to compare the proposed RAG-based approach to a baseline standard binary classification model. Thus, the proposed approach provides a comprehensive framework to address the challenge of cyber-attack knowledge graph completion.|Braden K Webb et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16176)|null|
|**2024-09-24**|**Merging LoRAs like Playing LEGO: Pushing the Modularity of LoRA to Extremes Through Rank-Wise Clustering**|Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a popular technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to various domains due to its modular design and widespread availability on platforms like Huggingface. This modularity has sparked interest in combining multiple LoRAs to enhance LLM capabilities. However, existing methods for LoRA composition primarily focus on task-specific adaptations that require additional training, and current model merging techniques often fail to fully leverage LoRA's modular nature, leading to parameter interference and performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of disassembling and reassembling multiple LoRAs at a finer granularity, analogous to assembling LEGO blocks. We introduce the concept of Minimal Semantic Units (MSUs), where the parameters corresponding to each rank in LoRA function as independent units. These MSUs demonstrate permutation invariance and concatenation-summation equivalence properties, enabling flexible combinations to create new LoRAs. Building on these insights, we propose the LoRA-LEGO framework. This framework conducts rank-wise parameter clustering by grouping MSUs from different LoRAs into $k$ clusters. The centroid of each cluster serves as a representative MSU, enabling the assembly of a merged LoRA with an adjusted rank of $k$ . Additionally, we apply a dual reweighting strategy to optimize the scale of the merged LoRA. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in LoRA merging.|Ziyu Zhao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16167)|null|
|**2024-09-24**|**Controlling Risk of Retrieval-augmented Generation: A Counterfactual Prompting Framework**|Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular solution to mitigate the hallucination issues of large language models. However, existing studies on RAG seldom address the issue of predictive uncertainty, i.e., how likely it is that a RAG model's prediction is incorrect, resulting in uncontrollable risks in real-world applications. In this work, we emphasize the importance of risk control, ensuring that RAG models proactively refuse to answer questions with low confidence. Our research identifies two critical latent factors affecting RAG's confidence in its predictions: the quality of the retrieved results and the manner in which these results are utilized. To guide RAG models in assessing their own confidence based on these two latent factors, we develop a counterfactual prompting framework that induces the models to alter these factors and analyzes the effect on their answers. We also introduce a benchmarking procedure to collect answers with the option to abstain, facilitating a series of experiments. For evaluation, we introduce several risk-related metrics and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.|Lu Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16146)|null|

First, via a substantial corpus of 51,278 interview questions sourced from 888 YouTube videos of mock interviews of Indian civil service candidates, we demonstrate stark gender bias in the broad nature of questions asked to male and female candidates. Second, our experiments with large language models show a strong presence of gender bias in explanations provided by the LLMs on the gender inference task.

|**2024-09-18**|**To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning**|Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications.|Zayne Sprague et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183)|null|
|**2024-09-23**|**A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs**|Broad textual understanding and in-context learning require language models that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges associated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation, utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several insights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of perplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods systematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm that exact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases, models, and checkpoints will be made available open-source, promoting transparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AI development.|Yi Lu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12181)|**[link](https://github.com/leooyii/lceg)**|
|**2024-09-18**|**Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty**|Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking and decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate information that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result, end-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore supervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty. Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then fine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of uncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and supervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to well-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim answers.|Arslan Chaudhry et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180)|null|
|**2024-09-18**|**Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit Recommendation with Preference**|Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their "black box" and static nature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item visual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style and color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the open-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative examples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates a self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank, and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's ability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the proposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit generation.|Najmeh Forouzandehmehr et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150)|null|
|**2024-09-18**|**MAgICoRe: Multi-Agent, Iterative, Coarse-to-Fine Refinement for Reasoning**|Large Language Models' (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test-time aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can over-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding how many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard ones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error localization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores. Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on step-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure sufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5 and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of MAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by 4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent communication.|Justin Chih-Yao Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147)|**[link](https://github.com/dinobby/magicore)**|

The method enhances motion diffusion models by leveraging additional knowledge obtained through an improved motion retrieval process. By effectively prompting large language models (LLMs), we address spelling errors and rephrasing issues in motion retrieval. Our approach utilizes a multi-part retrieval strategy to improve the generalizability of motion retrieval across the language space. We create diverse samples through the spatial composition of the retrieved motions. Furthermore, by utilizing low-level, part-specific motion information, we can construct motion samples for unseen text descriptions. Our experiments demonstrate that our framework can serve as a plug-and-play module, improving the performance of motion diffusion models.

|**2024-09-24**|**Takin: A Cohort of Superior Quality Zero-shot Speech Generation Models**|With the advent of the big data and large language model era, zero-shot personalized rapid customization has emerged as a significant trend. In this report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for audiobook production. These models are capable of zero-shot speech production, generating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a multi-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural speech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre and prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models.

The core innovation of the Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement throughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to inference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized to generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the post-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive sampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative evolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model, it's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct. (3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling, optimizing the model's performance.   Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math competition problems.|An Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12122)|null|

However, audio codecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and inference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we present the Low Frame-rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech language models to achieve high-quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps bitrate and 21.5 frames per second. We demonstrate that our novel codec can make the inference of LLM-based text-to-speech models around three times faster while improving intelligibility and producing quality comparable to previous models.|Edresson Casanova et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12117)|null|

This practice has inspired the development of Phidias, a novel generative model that uses diffusion for reference-augmented 3D generation. Given an image, our method leverages a retrieved or user-provided 3D reference model to guide the generation process, thereby enhancing the generation quality, generalization ability, and controllability. Our model integrates three key components: 1) meta-ControlNet that dynamically modulates the conditioning strength, 2) dynamic reference routing that mitigates misalignment between the input image and 3D reference, and 3) self-reference augmentations that enable self-supervised training with a progressive curriculum. Collectively, these designs result in a clear improvement over existing methods.

We address this gap by introducing seven synthetic datasets in dialects alongside Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), created using Machine Translation (MT) combined with human post-editing. We present AraDiCE, a benchmark for Arabic Dialect and Cultural Evaluation. We evaluate LLMs on dialect comprehension and generation, focusing specifically on low-resource Arabic dialects. Additionally, we introduce the first-ever fine-grained benchmark designed to evaluate cultural awareness across the Gulf, Egypt, and Levant regions, providing a novel dimension to LLM evaluation. Our findings demonstrate that while Arabic-specific models like Jais and AceGPT outperform multilingual models on dialectal tasks, significant challenges persist in dialect identification, generation, and translation. This work contributes ~45K post-edited samples, a cultural benchmark, and highlights the importance of tailored training to improve LLM performance in capturing the nuances of diverse Arabic dialects and cultural contexts.

Remarkably, NVLM 1.0 shows improved text-only performance over its LLM backbone after multimodal training. In terms of model design, we perform a comprehensive comparison between decoder-only multimodal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA) and cross-attention-based models (e.g., Flamingo). Based on the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, we propose a novel architecture that enhances both training efficiency and multimodal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a 1-D tile-tagging design for tile-based dynamic high-resolution images, which significantly boosts performance on multimodal reasoning and OCR-related tasks. Regarding training data, we meticulously curate and provide detailed information on our multimodal pretraining and supervised fine-tuning datasets. Our findings indicate that dataset quality and task diversity are more important than scale, even during the pretraining phase, across all architectures. Notably, we develop production-grade multimodality for the NVLM-1.0 models, enabling them to excel in vision-language tasks while maintaining and even improving text-only performance compared to their LLM backbones. To achieve this, we craft and integrate a high-quality text-only dataset into multimodal training, alongside a substantial amount of multimodal math and reasoning data, leading to enhanced math and coding capabilities across modalities. To advance research in the field, we are releasing the model weights and will open-source the code for the community: https://nvlm-project.github.io/.|Wenliang Dai et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11402)|null|
|**2024-09-17**|**LLM-Agent-UMF: LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework for Seamless Integration of Multi Active/Passive Core-Agents**|The integration of tools in LLM-based agents overcame the difficulties of standalone LLMs and traditional agents' limited capabilities. However, the conjunction of these technologies and the proposed enhancements in several state-of-the-art works followed a non-unified software architecture resulting in a lack of modularity. Indeed, they focused mainly on functionalities and overlooked the definition of the component's boundaries within the agent. This caused terminological and architectural ambiguities between researchers which we addressed in this paper by proposing a unified framework that establishes a clear foundation for LLM-based agents' development from both functional and software architectural perspectives.   Our framework, LLM-Agent-UMF (LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework), clearly distinguishes between the different components of an agent, setting LLMs, and tools apart from a newly introduced element: the core-agent, playing the role of the central coordinator of the agent which comprises five modules: planning, memory, profile, action, and security, the latter often neglected in previous works. Differences in the internal structure of core-agents led us to classify them into a taxonomy of passive and active types. Based on this, we proposed different multi-core agent architectures combining unique characteristics of various individual agents.   For evaluation purposes, we applied this framework to a selection of state-of-the-art agents, thereby demonstrating its alignment with their functionalities and clarifying the overlooked architectural aspects. Moreover, we thoroughly assessed four of our proposed architectures by integrating distinctive agents into hybrid active/passive core-agents' systems. This analysis provided clear insights into potential improvements and highlighted the challenges involved in the combination of specific agents.|Amine B.

Moreover, trained readers regularly disagree on interpretations, suggesting that this problem may be computationally intractable. In this paper, we provide experiments to test how well contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) perform when annotating literary texts for focalization mode. Despite the challenging nature of the task, LLMs show comparable performance to trained human annotators in our experiments. We provide a case study working with the novels of Stephen King to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for computational literary studies, illustrating how focalization can be studied at scale.|Rebecca M.

|**2024-09-17**|**Diversify and Conquer: Diversity-Centric Data Selection with Iterative Refinement**|Finetuning large language models on instruction data is crucial for enhancing pre-trained knowledge and improving instruction-following capabilities. As instruction datasets proliferate, selecting optimal data for effective training becomes increasingly important. This work addresses the question: How can we determine the optimal subset of data for effective training? While existing research often emphasizes local criteria like instance quality for subset selection, we argue that a global approach focused on data diversity is more critical. Our method employs k-means clustering to ensure the selected subset effectively represents the full dataset. We propose an iterative refinement method inspired by active learning techniques to resample instances from clusters, reassessing each cluster's importance and sampling weight in every training iteration. This approach reduces the effect of outliers and automatically filters out clusters containing low-quality data. Through extensive evaluation across natural language reasoning, general world knowledge, code and math reasoning tasks, and by fine-tuning models from various families, we observe consistent improvements, achieving a 7% increase over random selection and a 3.8% improvement over state-of-the-art sampling methods. Our work highlights the significance of diversity-first sampling when finetuning LLMs to enhance performance across a broad array of evaluation tasks.

|**2024-09-17**|**Towards Time Series Reasoning with LLMs**|Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled numerous advances in understanding and reasoning in domains like vision, but we have not yet seen this broad success for time-series. Although prior works on time-series MLLMs have shown promising performance in time-series forecasting, very few works show how an LLM could be used for time-series reasoning in natural language. We propose a novel multi-modal time-series LLM approach that learns generalizable information across various domains with powerful zero-shot performance. First, we train a lightweight time-series encoder on top of an LLM to directly extract time-series information. Then, we fine-tune our model with chain-of-thought augmented time-series tasks to encourage the model to generate reasoning paths. We show that our model learns a latent representation that reflects specific time-series features (e.g. slope, frequency), as well as outperforming GPT-4o on a set of zero-shot reasoning tasks on a variety of domains.|Winnie Chow et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11376)|null|

The capacity to generalize effectively on smaller datasets remains a persistent challenge. The scarcity of data presents a significant barrier to the practical implementation of scalable medical AI solutions. To address this issue, we've combined a wide range of data sources to improve performance and generalization to new data by giving it a deeper understanding of the data representation from multi-modal datasets and developed a self-supervised framework based on large language models (LLMs), SwinV2 to gain a deeper understanding of multi-modal dataset representations, enhancing the model's ability to extrapolate to new data for the detection of eye diseases using optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. We adopt a two-phase training methodology, self-supervised pre-training, and fine-tuning on a downstream supervised classifier. An ablation study conducted across three datasets employing various encoder backbones, without data fusion, with low data availability setting, and without self-supervised pre-training scenarios, highlights the robustness of our method. Our findings demonstrate consistent performance across these diverse conditions, showcasing superior generalization capabilities compared to the baseline model, ResNet-50.|Fatema-E- Jannat et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11375)|null|
|**2024-09-17**|**CoCA: Regaining Safety-awareness of Multimodal Large Language Models with Constitutional Calibration**|The deployment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated remarkable success in engaging in conversations involving visual inputs, thanks to the superior power of large language models (LLMs). Those MLLMs are typically built based on the LLMs, with an image encoder to process images into the token embedding space of the LLMs. However, the integration of visual modality has introduced a unique vulnerability: the MLLM becomes susceptible to malicious visual inputs and prone to generating sensitive or harmful responses, even though the LLM has been trained on textual dataset to align with human value. In this paper, we first raise the question: ``Do the MLLMs possess safety-awareness against malicious image inputs?". We find that after adding a principle that specifies the safety requirement into the input of the MLLM, the model's safety awareness becomes boosted. This phenomenon verifies the existence of MLLM's safety-awareness against image inputs, it is only weakened by the modality gap. We then introduce a simple yet effective technique termed CoCA, which amplifies the safety-awareness of the MLLM by calibrating its output distribution. Our proposed strategy helps the model reclaim its original safety awareness without losing its original capabilities. We verify the effectiveness of our approach on both multimodal safety and understanding benchmarks.|Jiahui Gao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11365)|null|

As these embedded AI applications are deployed globally, there is a growing concern that the AI models underlying these applications prioritize Western values. This paper investigates what happens when a Western-centric AI model provides writing suggestions to users from a different cultural background. We conducted a cross-cultural controlled experiment with 118 participants from India and the United States who completed culturally grounded writing tasks with and without AI suggestions. Our analysis reveals that AI provided greater efficiency gains for Americans compared to Indians. Moreover, AI suggestions led Indian participants to adopt Western writing styles, altering not just what is written but also how it is written. These findings show that Western-centric AI models homogenize writing toward Western norms, diminishing nuances that differentiate cultural expression.|Dhruv Agarwal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11360)|null|
|**2024-09-16**|**RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector Retrieval**|Transformer-based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important in various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention operation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to the extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse property of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off-the-shelf ANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for accurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity. RetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS-based attention, and addresses it via an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to queries and only access 1--3% of data, thus achieving a sub-linear time complexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of long-context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the model accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).|Di Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516)|null|
|**2024-09-16**|**Context-aware Code Segmentation for C-to-Rust Translation using Large Language Models**|There is strong motivation to translate C code into Rust code due to the continuing threat of memory safety vulnerabilities in existing C programs and the significant attention paid to Rust as an alternative to the C language. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating this translation by generating more natural and safer code than rule-based methods, previous studies have shown that LLM-generated Rust code often fails to compile, even for relatively small C programs, due to significant differences between the two languages and context window limitations. We propose an LLM-based translation scheme that improves the success rate of translating large-scale C code into compilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1) pre-processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with Rust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid exceeding the LLM's context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and repairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using context-supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step in achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further tested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding 4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable Rust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.|Momoko Shiraishi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506)|null|
|**2024-09-16**|**DILA: Dictionary Label Attention for Mechanistic Interpretability in High-dimensional Multi-label Medical Coding Prediction**|Predicting high-dimensional or extreme multilabels, such as in medical coding, requires both accuracy and interpretability. Existing works often rely on local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive explanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a multilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called DIctionary Label Attention (\method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense embeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a dictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through human evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human understandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our automated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language models (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and summarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We represent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes through a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global understanding of the model's predictions while maintaining competitive performance and scalability without extensive human annotation.|John Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10504)|null|
|**2024-09-16**|**Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on Logic Puzzles**|Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded remarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few years. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning capabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this work, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as solving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to search over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then apply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the application of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in a cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases, multiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We observe that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn to solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly) when trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that training Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and without such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis to Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves $92.04 \%$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal representations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear probing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any given cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine implicit in the Transformer weights.|Kulin Shah et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502)|null|

These tasks span from extracting data and summarizing literature to generating content, predictive modeling, decision-making, and system controls. Moreover, Vision Large Models (VLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which represent the next generation of language models, a.k.a., XLMs, can combine and integrate many data modalities with the strength of language understanding, thus advancing several information-based systems, such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Indeed, by combining language communication with multimodal sensory inputs, e.g., panoramic images and LiDAR or radar data, accurate driving actions can be taken. In this context, we provide in this survey paper a comprehensive overview of the potential of XLMs towards achieving autonomous driving. Specifically, we review the relevant literature on ADS and XLMs, including their architectures, tools, and frameworks. Then, we detail the proposed approaches to deploy XLMs for autonomous driving solutions. Finally, we provide the related challenges to XLM deployment for ADS and point to future research directions aiming to enable XLM adoption in future ADS frameworks.|Sonda Fourati et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10484)|null|
|**2024-09-17**|**Schrodinger's Memory: Large Language Models**|Memory is the foundation of all human activities; without memory, it would be nearly impossible for people to perform any task in daily life. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their language capabilities are becoming increasingly comparable to those of humans. But do LLMs have memory? Based on current performance, LLMs do appear to exhibit memory. So, what is the underlying mechanism of this memory? Previous research has lacked a deep exploration of LLMs' memory capabilities and the underlying theory. In this paper, we use Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) to explain the memory mechanism in LLMs. We also conduct experiments to verify the memory capabilities of various LLMs, proposing a new method to assess their abilities based on these memory ability. We argue that LLM memory operates like Schr\"odinger's memory, meaning that it only becomes observable when a specific memory is queried. We can only determine if the model retains a memory based on its output in response to the query; otherwise, it remains indeterminate. Finally, we expand on this concept by comparing the memory capabilities of the human brain and LLMs, highlighting the similarities and differences in their operational mechanisms.|Wei Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10482)|null|

Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but manually designing them can be effort-intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied in robotic task planning for generating action sequences, but their ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, We propose LLM as BT-planner, a novel framework to leverage LLMs for BT generation in robotic assembly task planning and execution. Four in-context learning methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference capabilities of LLMs to produce task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort and ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. We also evaluate the performance of fine-tuned, fewer-parameter LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in simulated and real-world settings show that our framework enhances LLMs' performance in BT generation, improving success rates in BT generation through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning.|Jicong Ao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10444)|null|
|**2024-09-16**|**A Large-Scale Privacy Assessment of Android Third-Party SDKs**|Third-party Software Development Kits (SDKs) are widely adopted in Android app development, to effortlessly accelerate development pipelines and enhance app functionality. However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about unauthorized access to users' privacy-sensitive information, which could be further abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization. Our study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android third-party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain. It focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data exfiltration and behavior-policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing techniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158 widely-used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a large alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data exfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30% of the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data handling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them over-collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We revisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months. Our analysis demonstrates a persistent lack of improvement in these concerning trends. Based on our findings, we propose three actionable recommendations to mitigate the privacy leakage risks and enhance privacy protection for Android users. Our research not only serves as an urgent call for industry attention but also provides crucial insights for future regulatory interventions.|Mark Huasong Meng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10411)|null|

Our approach extends traditional agent-based simulations by using strategic LLM agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a pro-social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro-social behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations. The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting in enhanced cooperation rates. This framework offers significant insights into AI-mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real-world team settings.|Qiliang Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10372)|null|
|**2024-09-13**|**Agents in Software Engineering: Survey, Landscape, and Vision**|In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and have been widely used in various downstream tasks, especially in the tasks of the software engineering (SE) field. We find that many studies combining LLMs with SE have employed the concept of agents either explicitly or implicitly. However, there is a lack of an in-depth survey to sort out the development context of existing works, analyze how existing works combine the LLM-based agent technologies to optimize various tasks, and clarify the framework of LLM-based agents in SE. In this paper, we conduct the first survey of the studies on combining LLM-based agents with SE and present a framework of LLM-based agents in SE which includes three key modules: perception, memory, and action. We also summarize the current challenges in combining the two fields and propose future opportunities in response to existing challenges.

Yet, often these two goals compete (e.g., an AI agent assisting a used car salesman selling a car with flaws), partly due to ambiguous or misleading user instructions. We propose AI-LieDar, a framework to study how LLM-based agents navigate scenarios with utility-truthfulness conflicts in a multi-turn interactive setting. We design a set of realistic scenarios where language agents are instructed to achieve goals that are in conflict with being truthful during a multi-turn conversation with simulated human agents. To evaluate the truthfulness at large scale, we develop a truthfulness detector inspired by psychological literature to assess the agents' responses. Our experiment demonstrates that all models are truthful less than 50% of the time, although truthfulness and goal achievement (utility) rates vary across models. We further test the steerability of LLMs towards truthfulness, finding that models follow malicious instructions to deceive, and even truth-steered models can still lie. These findings reveal the complex nature of truthfulness in LLMs and underscore the importance of further research to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of LLMs and AI agents.|Zhe Su et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09013)|null|

However, due to its unstructured and document format, it is challenging to extract useful information from them through conventional document retrieval methods. Scholarly knowledge graphs solve this problem, by representing the documents in a semantic network, providing, hidden insights, summaries and ease of accessibility through queries. Naturally, question answering for scholarly graphs expands the accessibility to a wider audience. But some of the knowledge in this domain is still presented as unstructured text, thus requiring a hybrid solution for question answering systems. In this paper, we present a two step solution using open source Large Language Model(LLM): Llama3.1 for Scholarly-QALD dataset. Firstly, we extract the context pertaining to the question from different structured and unstructured data sources: DBLP, SemOpenAlex knowledge graphs and Wikipedia text. Secondly, we implement prompt engineering to improve the information retrieval performance of the LLM. Our approach achieved an F1 score of 40% and also observed some anomalous responses from the LLM, that are discussed in the final part of the paper.|Kanchan Shivashankar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09010)|null|

However, traditional human-based compliance checking struggles with scaling due to the increasing volume of user-generated content and a limited number of moderators. Recent advancements in Natural Language Understanding demonstrated by Large Language Models unlock new opportunities for automated content compliance verification. This work evaluates six AI-agents built on Open-LLMs for automated rule compliance checking in Decentralized Social Networks, a challenging environment due to heterogeneous community scopes and rules. Analyzing over 50,000 posts from hundreds of Mastodon servers, we find that AI-agents effectively detect non-compliant content, grasp linguistic subtleties, and adapt to diverse community contexts. Most agents also show high inter-rater reliability and consistency in score justification and suggestions for compliance. Human-based evaluation with domain experts confirmed the agents' reliability and usefulness, rendering them promising tools for semi-automated or human-in-the-loop content moderation systems.|Lucio La Cava et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08963)|null|

LLMs require data for fine-tuning, a crucial step in enhancing their performance. In the context of conversational customer support, the data takes the form of a conversation between a human customer and an agent and can be generated with an AI assistant. In our inquiry, involving 11 users who each completed 8 tasks, resulting in a total of 88 tasks, we found that the presence of hallucinations negatively impacts the quality of data. We also find that, although the cognitive forcing function does not always mitigate the detrimental effects of hallucinations on data quality, the presence of cognitive forcing functions and hallucinations together impacts data quality and influences how users leverage the AI responses presented to them. Our analysis of user behavior reveals distinct patterns of reliance on AI-generated responses, highlighting the importance of managing hallucinations in AI-generated content within conversational AI contexts.|Zahra Ashktorab et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08937)|null|

Despite these advancements, effectively understanding the wide spectrum of user search queries continues to pose a significant challenge. An accurate query understanding system that can handle a variety of entities that represent different user intents is essential for delivering an enhanced user experience. We can build such a system by training a natural language understanding (NLU) model; however, obtaining high-quality labeled training data in this specialized domain is a substantial obstacle. Manual annotation is costly and impractical for capturing users' vast vocabulary variations. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) through weak supervision to automatically annotate a vast collection of user search queries. Using prompt engineering and a diverse set of LLM personas, we generate training data that matches human annotator expectations. By incorporating domain knowledge via Chain of Thought and In-Context Learning, our approach leverages the labeled data to train low-latency models optimized for real-time inference. Extensive evaluations demonstrated that our approach outperformed the baseline with an average relative gain of 113% in recall. Furthermore, our novel prompt engineering framework yields higher quality LLM-generated data to be used for weak supervision; we observed 47.60% improvement over baseline in agreement rate between LLM predictions and human annotations with respect to F1 score, weighted according to the distribution of occurrences of the search queries. Our persona selection routing mechanism further adds an additional 3.67% increase in weighted F1 score on top of our novel prompt engineering framework.|Farnoosh Javadi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08931)|null|

This design significantly reduces the need for human input by utilizing only essential simulation and deployment platforms, with the option to incorporate human-engineered strategies and historical data.

|**2024-09-13**|**A Market for Lemons? Strategic Directions for a Vigilant Application of Artificial Intelligence in Entrepreneurship Research**|The rapid expansion of AI adoption (e.g., using machine learning, deep learning, or large language models as research methods) and the increasing availability of big data have the potential to bring about the most significant transformation in entrepreneurship scholarship the field has ever witnessed. This article makes a pressing meta-contribution by highlighting a significant risk of unproductive knowledge exchanges in entrepreneurship research amid the AI revolution. It offers strategies to mitigate this risk and provides guidance for future AI-based studies to enhance their collective impact and relevance. Drawing on Akerlof's renowned market-for-lemons concept, we identify the potential for significant knowledge asymmetries emerging from the field's evolution into its current landscape (e.g., complexities around construct validity, theory building, and research relevance). Such asymmetries are particularly deeply ingrained due to what we term the double-black-box puzzle, where the widely recognized black box nature of AI methods intersects with the black box nature of the entrepreneurship phenomenon driven by inherent uncertainty. As a result, these asymmetries could lead to an increase in suboptimal research products that go undetected, collectively creating a market for lemons that undermines the field's well-being, reputation, and impact. However, importantly, if these risks can be mitigated, the AI revolution could herald a new golden era for entrepreneurship research. We discuss the necessary actions to elevate the field to a higher level of AI resilience while steadfastly maintaining its foundational principles and core values.|Martin Obschonka et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08890)|null|
|**2024-09-13**|**Visual Language Tracking with Multi-modal Interaction: A Robust Benchmark**|Visual Language Tracking (VLT) enhances tracking by mitigating the limitations of relying solely on the visual modality, utilizing high-level semantic information through language. This integration of the language enables more advanced human-machine interaction. The essence of interaction is cognitive alignment, which typically requires multiple information exchanges, especially in the sequential decision-making process of VLT. However, current VLT benchmarks do not account for multi-round interactions during tracking. They provide only an initial text and bounding box (bbox) in the first frame, with no further interaction as tracking progresses, deviating from the original motivation of the VLT task. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and robust benchmark, VLT-MI (Visual Language Tracking with Multi-modal Interaction), which introduces multi-round interaction into the VLT task for the first time. (1) We generate diverse, multi-granularity texts for multi-round, multi-modal interaction based on existing mainstream VLT benchmarks using DTLLM-VLT, leveraging the world knowledge of LLMs. (2) We propose a new VLT interaction paradigm that achieves multi-round interaction through text updates and object recovery. When multiple tracking failures occur, we provide the tracker with more aligned texts and corrected bboxes through interaction, thereby expanding the scope of VLT downstream tasks. (3) We conduct comparative experiments on both traditional VLT benchmarks and VLT-MI, evaluating and analyzing the accuracy and robustness of trackers under the interactive paradigm. This work offers new insights and paradigms for the VLT task, enabling a fine-grained evaluation of multi-modal trackers. We believe this approach can be extended to additional datasets in the future, supporting broader evaluations and comparisons of video-language model capabilities.|Xuchen Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08887)|null|

However, measuring agent performance in realistic environments remains a challenge since: (i) most benchmarks are limited to specific modalities or domains (e.g. text-only, web navigation, Q&A, coding) and (ii) full benchmark evaluations are slow (on order of magnitude of days) given the multi-step sequential nature of tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the Windows Agent Arena: a reproducible, general environment focusing exclusively on the Windows operating system (OS) where agents can operate freely within a real Windows OS and use the same wide range of applications, tools, and web browsers available to human users when solving tasks. We adapt the OSWorld framework (Xie et al., 2024) to create 150+ diverse Windows tasks across representative domains that require agent abilities in planning, screen understanding, and tool usage. Our benchmark is scalable and can be seamlessly parallelized in Azure for a full benchmark evaluation in as little as 20 minutes. To demonstrate Windows Agent Arena's capabilities, we also introduce a new multi-modal agent, Navi. Our agent achieves a success rate of 19.5% in the Windows domain, compared to 74.5% performance of an unassisted human. Navi also demonstrates strong performance on another popular web-based benchmark, Mind2Web. We offer extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of Navi's performance, and provide insights into the opportunities for future research in agent development and data generation using Windows Agent Arena.

In this paper, we propose Source2Synth: a new method that can be used for teaching LLMs new skills without relying on costly human annotations. Source2Synth takes as input a custom data source and produces synthetic data points with intermediate reasoning steps grounded in real-world sources. Source2Synth improves the dataset quality by discarding low-quality generations based on their answerability. We demonstrate the generality of this approach by applying it to two challenging domains: we test reasoning abilities in multi-hop question answering (MHQA), and tool usage in tabular question answering (TQA). Our method improves performance by 25.51% for TQA on WikiSQL and 22.57% for MHQA on HotPotQA compared to the fine-tuned baselines.|Alisia Lupidi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08239)|null|

Honeypots, which are decoy systems designed to lure and interact with attackers, have emerged as a critical component in cybersecurity. In this paper, we present a novel approach to creating realistic and interactive honeypot systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). By fine-tuning a pre-trained open-source language model on a diverse dataset of attacker-generated commands and responses, we developed a honeypot capable of sophisticated engagement with attackers. Our methodology involved several key steps: data collection and processing, prompt engineering, model selection, and supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model's performance. Evaluation through similarity metrics and live deployment demonstrated that our approach effectively generates accurate and informative responses. The results highlight the potential of LLMs to revolutionize honeypot technology, providing cybersecurity professionals with a powerful tool to detect and analyze malicious activity, thereby enhancing overall security infrastructure.|Hakan T.

|**2024-09-12**|**What Makes a Maze Look Like a Maze?**|A unique aspect of human visual understanding is the ability to flexibly interpret abstract concepts: acquiring lifted rules explaining what they symbolize, grounding them across familiar and unfamiliar contexts, and making predictions or reasoning about them. While off-the-shelf vision-language models excel at making literal interpretations of images (e.g., recognizing object categories such as tree branches), they still struggle to make sense of such visual abstractions (e.g., how an arrangement of tree branches may form the walls of a maze). To address this challenge, we introduce Deep Schema Grounding (DSG), a framework that leverages explicit structured representations of visual abstractions for grounding and reasoning. At the core of DSG are schemas--dependency graph descriptions of abstract concepts that decompose them into more primitive-level symbols. DSG uses large language models to extract schemas, then hierarchically grounds concrete to abstract components of the schema onto images with vision-language models. The grounded schema is used to augment visual abstraction understanding. We systematically evaluate DSG and different methods in reasoning on our new Visual Abstractions Dataset, which consists of diverse, real-world images of abstract concepts and corresponding question-answer pairs labeled by humans. We show that DSG significantly improves the abstract visual reasoning performance of vision-language models, and is a step toward human-aligned understanding of visual abstractions.|Joy Hsu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08202)|null|
|**2024-09-12**|**Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Entity Matching**|Generative large language models (LLMs) are a promising alternative to pre-trained language models for entity matching due to their high zero-shot performance and their ability to generalize to unseen entities. Existing research on using LLMs for entity matching has focused on prompt engineering and in-context learning. This paper explores the potential of fine-tuning LLMs for entity matching. We analyze fine-tuning along two dimensions: 1) The representation of training examples, where we experiment with adding different types of LLM-generated explanations to the training set, and 2) the selection and generation of training examples using LLMs. In addition to the matching performance on the source dataset, we investigate how fine-tuning affects the model's ability to generalize to other in-domain datasets as well as across topical domains. Our experiments show that fine-tuning significantly improves the performance of the smaller models while the results for the larger models are mixed. Fine-tuning also improves the generalization to in-domain datasets while hurting cross-domain transfer. We show that adding structured explanations to the training set has a positive impact on the performance of three out of four LLMs, while the proposed example selection and generation methods only improve the performance of Llama 3.1 8B while decreasing the performance of GPT-4o Mini.|Aaron Steiner et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08185)|**[link](https://github.com/wbsg-uni-mannheim/tailormatch)**|
|**2024-09-12**|**Faster Speech-LLaMA Inference with Multi-token Prediction**|Large language models (LLMs) have become proficient at solving a wide variety of tasks, including those involving multi-modal inputs. In particular, instantiating an LLM (such as LLaMA) with a speech encoder and training it on paired data imparts speech recognition (ASR) abilities to the decoder-only model, hence called Speech-LLaMA. Nevertheless, due to the sequential nature of auto-regressive inference and the relatively large decoder, Speech-LLaMA models require relatively high inference time. In this work, we propose to speed up Speech-LLaMA inference by predicting multiple tokens in the same decoding step. We explore several model architectures that enable this, and investigate their performance using threshold-based and verification-based inference strategies. We also propose a prefix-based beam search decoding method that allows efficient minimum word error rate (MWER) training for such models. We evaluate our models on a variety of public benchmarks, where they reduce the number of decoder calls by ~3.2x while maintaining or improving WER performance.|Desh Raj et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08148)|null|
|**2024-09-12**|**LLM-POTUS Score: A Framework of Analyzing Presidential Debates with Large Language Models**|Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, yet their application to political discourse analysis remains underexplored. This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating presidential debate performances using LLMs, addressing the longstanding challenge of objectively assessing debate outcomes. We propose a framework that analyzes candidates' "Policies, Persona, and Perspective" (3P) and how they resonate with the "Interests, Ideologies, and Identity" (3I) of four key audience groups: voters, businesses, donors, and politicians. Our method employs large language models to generate the LLM-POTUS Score, a quantitative measure of debate performance based on the alignment between 3P and 3I. We apply this framework to analyze transcripts from recent U.S. presidential debates, demonstrating its ability to provide nuanced, multi-dimensional assessments of candidate performances. Our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of different debating strategies and their impact on various audience segments. This study not only offers a new tool for political analysis but also explores the potential and limitations of using LLMs as impartial judges in complex social contexts. In addition, this framework provides individual citizens with an independent tool to evaluate presidential debate performances, which enhances democratic engagement and reduces reliance on potentially biased media interpretations and institutional influence, thereby strengthening the foundation of informed civic participation.|Zhengliang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08147)|null|

To address the challenge of extensive manual annotation, the study employs a large language model (LLM) for automatic annotation, resulting in the creation of the CLC-UKET dataset. The dataset consists of approximately 19,000 UKET cases and their metadata. Comprehensive legal annotations cover facts, claims, precedent references, statutory references, case outcomes, reasons and jurisdiction codes. Facilitated by the CLC-UKET data, we examine a multi-class case outcome prediction task in the UKET. Human predictions are collected to establish a performance reference for model comparison. Empirical results from baseline models indicate that finetuned transformer models outperform zero-shot and few-shot LLMs on the UKET prediction task. The performance of zero-shot LLMs can be enhanced by integrating task-related information into few-shot examples. We hope that the CLC-UKET dataset, along with human annotations and empirical findings, can serve as a valuable benchmark for employment-related dispute resolution.|Huiyuan Xie et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08098)|null|

This article reviews recent literature addressing key issues in LLM security, with a focus on accuracy, bias, content detection, and vulnerability to attacks. Issues related to inaccurate or misleading outputs from LLMs is discussed, with emphasis on the implementation from fact-checking methodologies to enhance response reliability. Inherent biases within LLMs are critically examined through diverse evaluation techniques, including controlled input studies and red teaming exercises. A comprehensive analysis of bias mitigation strategies is presented, including approaches from pre-processing interventions to in-training adjustments and post-processing refinements. The article also probes the complexity of distinguishing LLM-generated content from human-produced text, introducing detection mechanisms like DetectGPT and watermarking techniques while noting the limitations of machine learning enabled classifiers under intricate circumstances. Moreover, LLM vulnerabilities, including jailbreak attacks and prompt injection exploits, are analyzed by looking into different case studies and large-scale competitions like HackAPrompt. This review is concluded by retrospecting defense mechanisms to safeguard LLMs, accentuating the need for more extensive research into the LLM security field.|Benji Peng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08087)|null|

However, it is often too time-consuming for widespread use in educational practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have potential for automating feedback, they struggle with reasoning and interaction in an interactive setting. This paper introduces CAELF, a Contestable AI Empowered LLM Framework for automating interactive feedback. CAELF allows students to query, challenge, and clarify their feedback by integrating a multi-agent system with computational argumentation. Essays are first assessed by multiple Teaching-Assistant Agents (TA Agents), and then a Teacher Agent aggregates the evaluations through formal reasoning to generate feedback and grades. Students can further engage with the feedback to refine their understanding. A case study on 500 critical thinking essays with user studies demonstrates that CAELF significantly improves interactive feedback, enhancing the reasoning and interaction capabilities of LLMs. This approach offers a promising solution to overcoming the time and resource barriers that have limited the adoption of interactive feedback in educational settings.|Shengxin Hong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07453)|null|

Such a capability would be a boon to the research community, helping researchers validate, understand, and extend prior work. To advance towards this goal, we introduce SUPER, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of LLMs in setting up and executing tasks from research repositories. SUPERaims to capture the realistic challenges faced by researchers working with Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) research repositories. Our benchmark comprises three distinct problem sets: 45 end-to-end problems with annotated expert solutions, 152 sub problems derived from the expert set that focus on specific challenges (e.g., configuring a trainer), and 602 automatically generated problems for larger-scale development. We introduce various evaluation measures to assess both task success and progress, utilizing gold solutions when available or approximations otherwise. We show that state-of-the-art approaches struggle to solve these problems with the best model (GPT-4o) solving only 16.3% of the end-to-end set, and 46.1% of the scenarios. This illustrates the challenge of this task, and suggests that SUPER can serve as a valuable resource for the community to make and measure progress.|Ben Bogin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07440)|**[link](https://github.com/allenai/super-benchmark)**|
|**2024-09-11**|**Towards Fairer Health Recommendations: finding informative unbiased samples via Word Sense Disambiguation**|There have been growing concerns around high-stake applications that rely on models trained with biased data, which consequently produce biased predictions, often harming the most vulnerable. In particular, biased medical data could cause health-related applications and recommender systems to create outputs that jeopardize patient care and widen disparities in health outcomes. A recent framework titled Fairness via AI posits that, instead of attempting to correct model biases, researchers must focus on their root causes by using AI to debias data. Inspired by this framework, we tackle bias detection in medical curricula using NLP models, including LLMs, and evaluate them on a gold standard dataset containing 4,105 excerpts annotated by medical experts for bias from a large corpus. We build on previous work by coauthors which augments the set of negative samples with non-annotated text containing social identifier terms. However, some of these terms, especially those related to race and ethnicity, can carry different meanings (e.g., "white matter of spinal cord"). To address this issue, we propose the use of Word Sense Disambiguation models to refine dataset quality by removing irrelevant sentences. We then evaluate fine-tuned variations of BERT models as well as GPT models with zero- and few-shot prompting. We found LLMs, considered SOTA on many NLP tasks, unsuitable for bias detection, while fine-tuned BERT models generally perform well across all evaluated metrics.|Gavin Butts et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07424)|null|

As C/C++ comprises half of the Open-Source Software (OSS) vulnerabilities over the past decade and updates in OSS mainly occur through commits, enhancing LLMs' ability to identify C/C++ Vulnerability-Contributing Commits (VCCs) is essential. However, current studies primarily focus on further pre-training LLMs on massive code datasets, which is resource-intensive and poses efficiency challenges. In this paper, we enhance the ability of BERT-based LLMs to identify C/C++ VCCs in a lightweight manner. We propose CodeLinguaNexus (CLNX) as a bridge facilitating communication between C/C++ programs and LLMs. Based on commits, CLNX efficiently converts the source code into a more natural representation while preserving key details. Specifically, CLNX first applies structure-level naturalization to decompose complex programs, followed by token-level naturalization to interpret complex symbols. We evaluate CLNX on public datasets of 25,872 C/C++ functions with their commits. The results show that CLNX significantly enhances the performance of LLMs on identifying C/C++ VCCs. Moreover, CLNX-equipped CodeBERT achieves new state-of-the-art and identifies 38 OSS vulnerabilities in the real world.|Zeqing Qin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07407)|null|
|**2024-09-11**|**AdaCAD: Adaptively Decoding to Balance Conflicts between Contextual and Parametric Knowledge**|Knowledge conflict arises from discrepancies between information in the context of a large language model (LLM) and the knowledge stored in its parameters. This can hurt performance when using standard decoding techniques, which tend to ignore the context. Existing test-time contrastive methods seek to address this by comparing the LLM's output distribution with and without the context and adjust the model according to the contrast between them. However, we find that these methods frequently misjudge the degree of conflict and struggle to handle instances that vary in their amount of conflict, with static methods over-adjusting when conflict is absent. We propose a fine-grained, instance-level approach called AdaCAD, which dynamically infers the weight of adjustment based on the degree of conflict, as measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence between distributions representing contextual and parametric knowledge. Our experiments across four models on six diverse question-answering (QA) datasets and three summarization tasks demonstrate that our training-free adaptive method consistently outperforms other decoding methods on QA, with average accuracy gains of 14.21% (absolute) over a static contrastive baseline, and improves the factuality of summaries by 5.59 (AlignScore). Furthermore, our analysis shows that while decoding with contrastive baselines hurts performance when conflict is absent, AdaCAD mitigates these losses, making it more applicable to real-world datasets in which some examples have conflict and others do not.|Han Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07394)|**[link](https://github.com/hannight/adacad)**|

We populated SGCode on an AWS server with PromSec, an approach that optimizes prompts by combining an LLM and security tools with a lightweight generative adversarial graph neural network to detect and fix security vulnerabilities in the generated code. Extensive experiments show that SGCode is practical as a public tool to gain insights into the trade-offs between model utility, secure code generation, and system cost.

By combining human flexibility and reasoning with LLM consistency, InteractEval outperforms traditional non-LLM-based and LLM-based baselines across four distinct dimensions, consisting of Coherence, Fluency, Consistency, and Relevance. The experiment also investigates the effectiveness of the TA method, showing that it promotes divergent thinking in both humans and LLMs, leading to the generation of a wider range of relevant attributes and enhance text evaluation performance. Comparative analysis reveals that humans excel at identifying attributes related to internal quality (Coherence and Fluency), but LLMs perform better at those attributes related to external alignment (Consistency and Relevance). Consequently, leveraging both humans and LLMs together produces the best evaluation outcomes. In other words, this study emphasizes the necessity of effectively combining humans and LLMs in an automated checklist-based text evaluation framework.

|**2024-09-11**|**Securing Vision-Language Models with a Robust Encoder Against Jailbreak and Adversarial Attacks**|Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), trained on multimodal big datasets, have significantly advanced AI by excelling in vision-language tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly jailbreak attacks, which bypass safety protocols and cause the model to generate misleading or harmful responses. This vulnerability stems from both the inherent susceptibilities of LLMs and the expanded attack surface introduced by the visual modality. We propose Sim-CLIP+, a novel defense mechanism that adversarially fine-tunes the CLIP vision encoder by leveraging a Siamese architecture. This approach maximizes cosine similarity between perturbed and clean samples, facilitating resilience against adversarial manipulations. Sim-CLIP+ offers a plug-and-play solution, allowing seamless integration into existing LVLM architectures as a robust vision encoder. Unlike previous defenses, our method requires no structural modifications to the LVLM and incurs minimal computational overhead. Sim-CLIP+ demonstrates effectiveness against both gradient-based adversarial attacks and various jailbreak techniques. We evaluate Sim-CLIP+ against three distinct jailbreak attack strategies and perform clean evaluations using standard downstream datasets, including COCO for image captioning and OKVQA for visual question answering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sim-CLIP+ maintains high clean accuracy while substantially improving robustness against both gradient-based adversarial attacks and jailbreak techniques.

|**2024-09-11**|**Learning to Compress Contexts for Efficient Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering**|Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated great zero-shot performance on visual question answering (VQA). However, when it comes to knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA), MLLMs may lack human commonsense or specialized domain knowledge to answer such questions and require obtaining necessary information from external knowledge sources. Previous works like Retrival-Augmented VQA-v2 (RAVQA-v2) focus on utilizing as much input information, such as image-based textual descriptions and retrieved knowledge, as possible to improve performance, but they all overlook the issue that with the number of input tokens increasing, inference efficiency significantly decreases, which contradicts the demands of practical applications. To address this issue, we propose Retrieval-Augmented MLLM with Compressed Contexts (RACC). RACC learns to compress and aggregate retrieved contexts, from which it generates a compact modulation in the form of Key-Value (KV) cache. This modulation is then used to adapt the downstream frozen MLLM, thereby achieving effective and efficient inference. RACC achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of 62.9% on OK-VQA. Moreover, it significantly reduces inference latency by 22.0%-59.7% compared to the prominent RAVQA-v2. Abundant experiments show RACC's broad applicability. It is compatible with various off-the-shelf MLLMs and can also handle different knowledge sources including textual and multimodal documents.|Weixi Weng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07331)|null|

While real-world assessments are valuable indicators of utility, they often lag behind the pace of LLM evolution, likely rendering findings obsolete upon deployment. This temporal disconnect necessitates a comprehensive upfront evaluation that can guide model selection for specific clinical applications. We introduce MEDIC, a framework assessing LLMs across five critical dimensions of clinical competence: medical reasoning, ethics and bias, data and language understanding, in-context learning, and clinical safety. MEDIC features a novel cross-examination framework quantifying LLM performance across areas like coverage and hallucination detection, without requiring reference outputs. We apply MEDIC to evaluate LLMs on medical question-answering, safety, summarization, note generation, and other tasks. Our results show performance disparities across model sizes, baseline vs medically finetuned models, and have implications on model selection for applications requiring specific model strengths, such as low hallucination or lower cost of inference. MEDIC's multifaceted evaluation reveals these performance trade-offs, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical implementation in healthcare settings, ensuring that the most promising models are identified and adapted for diverse healthcare applications.|Praveen K Kanithi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07314)|null|

However, it is reasonable to think that they can vary with different individuals, and thus should be distributional to reflect the fine-grained relationship between the responses. In this work, we introduce the distributional soft preference labels and improve Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a weighted geometric average of the LLM output likelihood in the loss function. In doing so, the scale of learning loss is adjusted based on the soft labels, and the loss with equally preferred responses would be close to zero. This simple modification can be easily applied to any DPO family and helps the models escape from the over-optimization and objective mismatch prior works suffer from. In our experiments, we simulate the soft preference labels with AI feedback from LLMs and demonstrate that geometric averaging consistently improves performance on standard benchmarks for alignment research. In particular, we observe more preferable responses than binary labels and significant improvements with data where modestly-confident labels are in the majority.|Hiroki Furuta et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06691)|null|

This paper addresses the challenges of enhancing the long-context performance, reducing computational complexity, and leveraging pretrained models collectively termed the "impossible triangle." We introduce E2LLM (Encoder Elongated Large Language Models), a novel approach that effectively navigates this paradox. The method involves splitting long contexts into chunks, compressing each into embedding vectors via a pretrained text encoder, and utilizing an adapter to align these representations with a decoder-only LLM. Two training objectives, focusing on reconstruction of the encoder output and long-context instruction fine-tuning, are employed to facilitate the understanding of soft prompts by the LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that E2LLM achieves superior performance in long-context scenarios while balancing efficiency, performance, and compatibility with pretrained models. Our framework thus represents a significant advancement in the field, contributing to effective long-text modeling.|Zihan Liao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06679)|null|

However, there is still a lack of exploration on how to build speech interaction models based on open-source LLMs. To address this, we propose LLaMA-Omni, a novel model architecture designed for low-latency and high-quality speech interaction with LLMs. LLaMA-Omni integrates a pretrained speech encoder, a speech adaptor, an LLM, and a streaming speech decoder. It eliminates the need for speech transcription, and can simultaneously generate text and speech responses directly from speech instructions with extremely low latency. We build our model based on the latest Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. To align the model with speech interaction scenarios, we construct a dataset named InstructS2S-200K, which includes 200K speech instructions and corresponding speech responses. Experimental results show that compared to previous speech-language models, LLaMA-Omni provides better responses in both content and style, with a response latency as low as 226ms. Additionally, training LLaMA-Omni takes less than 3 days on just 4 GPUs, paving the way for the efficient development of speech-language models in the future.|Qingkai Fang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06666)|**[link](https://github.com/ictnlp/llama-omni)**|

To investigate the human perception of LLM-generated content, we recruited over 1,000 participants who then tried to differentiate bot from human posts in social media discussion threads. We found that humans perform poorly at identifying the true nature of user posts on social media. We also found patterns in how humans identify LLM-generated text content in social media discourse. Finally, we observed the Uncanny Valley effect in text dialogue in both user perception and identification.

To help with this goal, several of the current generation of GPUs support a partitioning feature, called Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) to allow multiple workloads to share a GPU, albeit with some constraints. In this paper we investigate how to optimize the placement of Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI Inferencing workloads on GPUs. We first identify and present several use cases that are encountered in practice that require workloads to be efficiently placed or migrated to other GPUs to make room for incoming workloads. The overarching goal is to use as few GPUs as possible and to further minimize memory and compute wastage on GPUs that are utilized. We have developed two approaches to address this problem: an optimization method and a heuristic method. We benchmark these with two workload scheduling heuristics for multiple use cases. Our results show up to 2.85x improvement in the number of GPUs used and up to 70% reduction in GPU wastage over baseline heuristics.

Existing AudioLLMs typically combine a pre-trained audio encoder with a pre-trained LLM, which are subsequently finetuned on specific audio tasks. However, the pre-trained audio encoder has constrained capacity to capture features for new tasks and datasets. To address this, we propose to incorporate mixtures of `weak' encoders (MoWE) into the AudioLLM framework. MoWE supplements a base encoder with a pool of relatively light weight encoders, selectively activated based on the audio input to enhance feature extraction without significantly increasing model size. Our empirical results demonstrate that MoWE effectively improves multi-task performance, broadening the applicability of AudioLLMs to more diverse audio tasks.|Wenyu Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06635)|null|

The huge training cost of CPT often asks for cautious choice of key hyper-parameters such as the mixture ratio of extra language or domain corpus. However, there is no systematic study which bridge the gap between the optimal mixture ratio and the actual model performance, and the gap between experimental scaling law and the actual deployment in the full model size. In this paper, we perform CPT on Llama-3 8B and 70B to enhance its Chinese ability. We study the optimal correlation between the Additional Language Mixture Ratio (ALMR) and the Learning Rate (LR) on the 8B size which directly indicate the optimal experimental set up. By thorough choice of hyper-parameter, and subsequent fine-tuning, the model capability is improved not only on the Chinese-related benchmark, but also some specific domains including math, coding and emotional intelligence. We deploy the final 70B version of LLM on an real-life chat system which obtain satisfying performance.|Ningyuan Xi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06624)|null|
|**2024-09-10**|**Exploring Italian sentence embeddings properties through multi-tasking**|We investigate to what degree existing LLMs encode abstract linguistic information in Italian in a multi-task setting. We exploit curated synthetic data on a large scale -- several Blackbird Language Matrices (BLMs) problems in Italian -- and use them to study how sentence representations built using pre-trained language models encode specific syntactic and semantic information. We use a two-level architecture to model separately a compression of the sentence embeddings into a representation that contains relevant information for a task, and a BLM task. We then investigate whether we can obtain compressed sentence representations that encode syntactic and semantic information relevant to several BLM tasks. While we expected that the sentence structure -- in terms of sequence of phrases/chunks -- and chunk properties could be shared across tasks, performance and error analysis show that the clues for the different tasks are encoded in different manners in the sentence embeddings, suggesting that abstract linguistic notions such as constituents or thematic roles does not seem to be present in the pretrained sentence embeddings.|Vivi Nastase et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06622)|null|

Uncertainty estimation could be used for alleviating the damages of hallucinations. The skeptical emotion of human could be useful for enhancing the ability of self estimation. Inspirited by this observation, we proposed a new approach called Skepticism Modeling (SM). This approach is formalized by combining the information of token and logits for self estimation. We construct the doubt emotion aware data, perform continual pre-training, and then fine-tune the LLMs, improve their ability of self estimation. Experimental results demonstrate this new approach effectively enhances a model's ability to estimate their uncertainty, and validate its generalization ability of other tasks by out-of-domain experiments.|Yetao Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06601)|null|
|**2024-09-09**|**MMEvol: Empowering Multimodal Large Language Models with Evol-Instruct**|The development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has seen significant advancements. However, the quantity and quality of multimodal instruction data have emerged as significant bottlenecks in their progress. Manually creating multimodal instruction data is both time-consuming and inefficient, posing challenges in producing instructions of high complexity. Moreover, distilling instruction data from black-box commercial models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4V) often results in simplistic instruction data, which constrains performance to that of these models. The challenge of curating diverse and complex instruction data remains substantial. We propose MMEvol, a novel multimodal instruction data evolution framework that combines fine-grained perception evolution, cognitive reasoning evolution, and interaction evolution. This iterative approach breaks through data quality bottlenecks to generate a complex and diverse image-text instruction dataset, thereby empowering MLLMs with enhanced capabilities. Beginning with an initial set of instructions, SEED-163K, we utilize MMEvol to systematically broadens the diversity of instruction types, integrates reasoning steps to enhance cognitive capabilities, and extracts detailed information from images to improve visual understanding and robustness. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of our data, we train LLaVA-NeXT using the evolved data and conduct experiments across 13 vision-language tasks. Compared to the baseline trained with seed data, our approach achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.1 points and reaches state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on 9 of these tasks.|Run Luo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05840)|null|

An Exploratory Study**|Competitive programming platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank evaluate programming skills, often used by recruiters for screening. With the rise of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Meta AI, their problem-solving ability on these platforms needs assessment. This study explores LLMs' ability to tackle diverse programming challenges across platforms with varying difficulty, offering insights into their real-time and offline performance and comparing them with human programmers.   We tested 98 problems from LeetCode, 126 from Codeforces, covering 15 categories. Nine online contests from Codeforces and LeetCode were conducted, along with two certification tests on HackerRank, to assess real-time performance. Prompts and feedback mechanisms were used to guide LLMs, and correlations were explored across different scenarios.   LLMs, like ChatGPT (71.43% success on LeetCode), excelled in LeetCode and HackerRank certifications but struggled in virtual contests, particularly on Codeforces. They performed better than users in LeetCode archives, excelling in time and memory efficiency but underperforming in harder Codeforces contests. While not immediately threatening, LLMs performance on these platforms is concerning, and future improvements will need addressing.|Md Mustakim Billah et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05824)|null|
|**2024-09-09**|**Improving Pretraining Data Using Perplexity Correlations**|Quality pretraining data is often seen as the key to high-performance language models. However, progress in understanding pretraining data has been slow due to the costly pretraining runs required for data selection experiments. We present a framework that avoids these costs and selects high-quality pretraining data without any LLM training of our own. Our work is based on a simple observation: LLM losses on many pretraining texts are correlated with downstream benchmark performance, and selecting high-correlation documents is an effective pretraining data selection method. We build a new statistical framework for data selection centered around estimates of perplexity-benchmark correlations and perform data selection using a sample of 90 LLMs taken from the Open LLM Leaderboard on texts from tens of thousands of web domains. In controlled pretraining experiments at the 160M parameter scale on 8 benchmarks, our approach outperforms DSIR on every benchmark, while matching the best data selector found in DataComp-LM, a hand-engineered bigram classifier.|Tristan Thrush et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05816)|null|
|**2024-09-09**|**Benchmarking Chinese Knowledge Rectification in Large Language Models**|While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, they are not without flaws, particularly in the form of hallucinations. This issue is even more pronounced when LLMs are applied to specific languages and domains. For example, LLMs may generate nonsense information when handling Chinese ancient poetry, proverbs, or idioms, owing to the lack of specific knowledge. To this end, this paper introduces a benchmark for rectifying Chinese knowledge in LLMs via knowledge editing. Specifically, we introduce a new Chinese dataset, CKnowEdit, by collecting seven type of knowledge from various sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, thereby accounting for the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical constructs inherent in the Chinese language. Through the analysis of this dataset, we uncover the challenges faced by current LLMs in mastering Chinese. Furthermore, our evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques on this dataset unveil the substantial scope for advancement in the rectification of Chinese knowledge.

|**2024-09-09**|**Evidence from fMRI Supports a Two-Phase Abstraction Process in Language Models**|Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.|Emily Cheng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05771)|null|
|**2024-09-09**|**Model Input Verification of Large Scale Simulations**|Reliable simulations are critical for analyzing and understanding complex systems, but their accuracy depends on correct input data. Incorrect inputs such as invalid or out-of-range values, missing data, and format inconsistencies can cause simulation crashes or unnoticed result distortions, ultimately undermining the validity of the conclusions. This paper presents a methodology for verifying the validity of input data in simulations, a process we term model input verification (MIV). We implement this approach in FabGuard, a toolset that uses established data schema and validation tools for the specific needs of simulation modeling. We introduce a formalism for categorizing MIV patterns and offer a streamlined verification pipeline that integrates into existing simulation workflows. FabGuard's applicability is demonstrated across three diverse domains: conflict-driven migration, disaster evacuation, and disease spread models. We also explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating constraint generation and inference. In a case study with a migration simulation, LLMs not only correctly inferred 22 out of 23 developer-defined constraints, but also identified errors in existing constraints and proposed new, valid constraints. Our evaluation demonstrates that MIV is feasible on large datasets, with FabGuard efficiently processing 12,000 input files in 140 seconds and maintaining consistent performance across varying file sizes.|Rumyana Neykova et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05768)|null|

It is a dynamic, interactive, and contextually responsive approach, actively involving a large language model (LLM) from the domain of natural language processing (NLP) in artificial intelligence (AI) to produce multiple statements of potential ideas for different design problems. Integrating such AI models with ideation creates what we refer to as an Active Ideation scenario, which helps foster continuous dialogue-based interaction, context-sensitive conversation, and prolific idea generation. A pilot study was conducted with thirty novice designers to generate ideas for given problems using traditional methods and the new CAI-based interface. The key parameters of fluency, novelty, and variety were used to compare the outcomes qualitatively by a panel of experts. The findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed tool for generating prolific, diverse and novel ideas. The interface was enhanced by incorporating a prompt-engineered structured dialogue style for each ideation stage to make it uniform and more convenient for the designers. The resulting responses of such a structured CAI interface were found to be more succinct and aligned towards the subsequent design stage, namely conceptualization. The paper thus established the rich potential of using Generative AI (Gen-AI) for the early ill-structured phase of the creative product design process.|B.

|**2024-09-09**|**LLMs Will Always Hallucinate, and We Need to Live With This**|As Large Language Models become more ubiquitous across domains, it becomes important to examine their inherent limitations critically. This work argues that hallucinations in language models are not just occasional errors but an inevitable feature of these systems. We demonstrate that hallucinations stem from the fundamental mathematical and logical structure of LLMs. It is, therefore, impossible to eliminate them through architectural improvements, dataset enhancements, or fact-checking mechanisms. Our analysis draws on computational theory and Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem, which references the undecidability of problems like the Halting, Emptiness, and Acceptance Problems. We demonstrate that every stage of the LLM process-from training data compilation to fact retrieval, intent classification, and text generation-will have a non-zero probability of producing hallucinations. This work introduces the concept of Structural Hallucination as an intrinsic nature of these systems. By establishing the mathematical certainty of hallucinations, we challenge the prevailing notion that they can be fully mitigated.|Sourav Banerjee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05746)|null|
|**2024-09-09**|**A System and Benchmark for LLM-based Q\&A on Heterogeneous Data**|In many industrial settings, users wish to ask questions whose answers may be found in structured data sources such as a spreadsheets, databases, APIs, or combinations thereof. Often, the user doesn't know how to identify or access the right data source. This problem is compounded even further if multiple (and potentially siloed) data sources must be assembled to derive the answer. Recently, various Text-to-SQL applications that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) have addressed some of these problems by enabling users to ask questions in natural language. However, these applications remain impractical in realistic industrial settings because they fail to cope with the data source heterogeneity that typifies such environments. In this paper, we address heterogeneity by introducing the siwarex platform, which enables seamless natural language access to both databases and APIs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of siwarex, we extend the popular Spider dataset and benchmark by replacing some of its tables by data retrieval APIs. We find that siwarex does a good job of coping with data source heterogeneity. Our modified Spider benchmark will soon be available to the research community|Achille Fokoue et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05735)|null|
|**2024-09-09**|**Towards Democratizing Multilingual Large Language Models For Medicine Through A Two-Stage Instruction Fine-tuning Approach**|Open-source, multilingual medical large language models (LLMs) have the potential to serve linguistically diverse populations across different regions. Adapting generic LLMs for healthcare often requires continual pretraining, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes impractical. Instruction fine-tuning on a specific task may not always guarantee optimal performance due to the lack of broader domain knowledge that the model needs to understand and reason effectively in diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce two multilingual instruction fine-tuning datasets, MMed-IFT and MMed-IFT-MC, containing over 200k high-quality medical samples in six languages. We propose a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage injects general medical knowledge using MMed-IFT, while the second stage fine-tunes task-specific multiple-choice questions with MMed-IFT-MC. Our method achieves competitive results on both English and multilingual benchmarks, striking a balance between computational efficiency and performance.

|**2024-09-06**|**RLPF: Reinforcement Learning from Prediction Feedback for User Summarization with LLMs**|LLM-powered personalization agent systems employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict users' behavior from their past activities. However, their effectiveness often hinges on the ability to effectively leverage extensive, long user historical data due to its inherent noise and length of such data. Existing pretrained LLMs may generate summaries that are concise but lack the necessary context for downstream tasks, hindering their utility in personalization systems. To address these challenges, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Prediction Feedback (RLPF). RLPF fine-tunes LLMs to generate concise, human-readable user summaries that are optimized for downstream task performance. By maximizing the usefulness of the generated summaries, RLPF effectively distills extensive user history data while preserving essential information for downstream tasks. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in both extrinsic downstream task utility and intrinsic summary quality, surpassing baseline methods by up to 22% on downstream task performance and achieving an up to 84.59% win rate on Factuality, Abstractiveness, and Readability. RLPF also achieves a remarkable 74% reduction in context length while improving performance on 16 out of 19 unseen tasks and/or datasets, showcasing its generalizability. This approach offers a promising solution for enhancing LLM personalization by effectively transforming long, noisy user histories into informative and human-readable representations.|Jiaxing Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04421)|null|

In this paper, we present question-answering dense video events, a novel task that requires answering and grounding the dense-event questions in long videos, thus challenging MLLMs to faithfully comprehend and reason about multiple events occurring over extended time periods. To facilitate the study, we construct DeVE-QA - a dataset featuring 78K questions about 26K events on 10.6K long videos. We then benchmark and show that existing MLLMs excelling at single-event QA struggle to perform well in DeVE-QA. For improvement, we propose DeVi, a novel training-free MLLM approach that highlights a hierarchical captioning module, a temporal event memory module, and a self-consistency checking module to respectively detect, contextualize and memorize, and ground dense-events in long videos for question answering. Extensive experiments show that DeVi is superior at answering dense-event questions and grounding relevant video moments. Compared with existing MLLMs, it achieves a remarkable increase of 4.1 percent and 3.7 percent for G(round)QA accuracy on DeVE-QA and NExT-GQA respectively.|Hangyu Qin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04388)|null|

While much research has addressed racial and gender biases, age bias remains little explored. The scarcity of instruction-tuning and preference datasets for age bias hampers its detection and measurement, and existing fine-tuning methods seldom address age-related fairness. In this paper, we construct age bias preference datasets and instruction-tuning datasets for RLHF. We introduce ARG, an age fairness reward to reduce differences in the response quality of LLMs across different age groups. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this reward significantly improves response accuracy and reduces performance disparities across age groups.

However, the underlying mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) is still a major research question, and experimental research results about how models exploit ICL are not always consistent. In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating in-context learning mechanisms, which we claim are a combination of retrieving internal knowledge and learning from in-context examples by focusing on regression tasks. First, we show that LLMs can perform regression on real-world datasets and then design experiments to measure the extent to which the LLM retrieves its internal knowledge versus learning from in-context examples. We argue that this process lies on a spectrum between these two extremes. We provide an in-depth analysis of the degrees to which these mechanisms are triggered depending on various factors, such as prior knowledge about the tasks and the type and richness of the information provided by the in-context examples. We employ three LLMs and utilize multiple datasets to corroborate the robustness of our findings. Our results shed light on how to engineer prompts to leverage meta-learning from in-context examples and foster knowledge retrieval depending on the problem being addressed.|Aliakbar Nafar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04318)|null|

This increase of applications and required resources start to become limited by present day hardware technologies. Indeed, novel machine learning subjects such as large language models or high resolution image recognition raise the question of large computing time and energy cost of the required computation. In this context, optical platforms have been designed for several years with the goal of developing more efficient hardware for machine learning. Among different explored platforms, optical free-space propagation offers various advantages: parallelism, low energy cost and computational speed. Here, we present a new design combining the strong and tunable nonlinear properties of a light beam propagating through a hot atomic vapor with an Extreme Learning Machine model.

These issues hinder objective and comparable data-driven evaluations and optimizations of knowledge work assistance systems. Due to the considerable resources needed to collect such data in real-life settings and the necessity of data censorship, collecting such a dataset appears nearly impossible. For this reason, we propose a configurable, multi-agent knowledge work dataset generator. This system simulates collaborative knowledge work among agents producing Large Language Model-generated documents and accompanying data traces. Additionally, the generator captures all background information, given in its configuration or created during the simulation process, in a knowledge graph. Finally, the resulting dataset can be utilized and shared without privacy or confidentiality concerns.   This paper introduces our approach's design and vision and focuses on generating authentic knowledge work documents using Large Language Models. Our study involving human raters who assessed 53% of the generated and 74% of the real documents as realistic demonstrates the potential of our approach.

In this work, a LLM-based optimization paradigm is introduced to establish an autonomous model factory for generating knowledge transfer models, ensuring effective and efficient knowledge transfer across various optimization tasks. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conducted comprehensive empirical studies comparing the knowledge transfer model generated by the LLM with existing state-of-the-art knowledge transfer methods.

As the vision encoders of most MLLMs are trained on natural scenes, they often struggle to understand geometric diagrams, performing no better in geometry problem solving than LLMs that only process text. This limitation is amplified by the lack of effective methods for representing geometric relationships. To address these issues, we introduce the Diagram Formalization Enhanced Geometry Problem Solver (DFE-GPS), a new framework that integrates visual features, geometric formal language, and natural language representations. We propose a novel synthetic data approach and create a large-scale geometric dataset, SynthGeo228K, annotated with both formal and natural language captions, designed to enhance the vision encoder for a better understanding of geometric structures.

Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Model. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with four different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 8B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3.|Ziyin Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04183)|null|
|**2024-09-06**|**Combining LLMs and Knowledge Graphs to Reduce Hallucinations in Question Answering**|Advancements in natural language processing have revolutionized the way we can interact with digital information systems, such as databases, making them more accessible. However, challenges persist, especially when accuracy is critical, as in the biomedical domain. A key issue is the hallucination problem, where models generate information unsupported by the underlying data, potentially leading to dangerous misinformation. This paper presents a novel approach designed to bridge this gap by combining Large Language Models (LLM) and Knowledge Graphs (KG) to improve the accuracy and reliability of question-answering systems, on the example of a biomedical KG. Built on the LangChain framework, our method incorporates a query checker that ensures the syntactical and semantic validity of LLM-generated queries, which are then used to extract information from a Knowledge Graph, substantially reducing errors like hallucinations. We evaluated the overall performance using a new benchmark dataset of 50 biomedical questions, testing several LLMs, including GPT-4 Turbo and llama3:70b. Our results indicate that while GPT-4 Turbo outperforms other models in generating accurate queries, open-source models like llama3:70b show promise with appropriate prompt engineering. To make this approach accessible, a user-friendly web-based interface has been developed, allowing users to input natural language queries, view generated and corrected Cypher queries, and verify the resulting paths for accuracy. Overall, this hybrid approach effectively addresses common issues such as data gaps and hallucinations, offering a reliable and intuitive solution for question answering systems.

Consequently, their development relies heavily on data-driven approaches, limiting performance enhancement through changes in internal architecture and reasoning pathways. As a result, many researchers have begun exploring the potential internal mechanisms of LLMs, aiming to identify the essence of their reasoning bottlenecks, with most studies focusing on attention heads. Our survey aims to shed light on the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by concentrating on the interpretability and underlying mechanisms of attention heads. We first distill the human thought process into a four-stage framework: Knowledge Recalling, In-Context Identification, Latent Reasoning, and Expression Preparation. Using this framework, we systematically review existing research to identify and categorize the functions of specific attention heads. Furthermore, we summarize the experimental methodologies used to discover these special heads, dividing them into two categories: Modeling-Free methods and Modeling-Required methods. Also, we outline relevant evaluation methods and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current research and propose several potential future directions.

|**2024-09-05**|**LLM-CI: Assessing Contextual Integrity Norms in Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs), while memorizing parts of their training data scraped from the Internet, may also inadvertently encode societal preferences and norms. As these models are integrated into sociotechnical systems, it is crucial that the norms they encode align with societal expectations. These norms could vary across models, hyperparameters, optimization techniques, and datasets. This is especially challenging due to prompt sensitivity $-$ small variations in prompts yield different responses, rendering existing assessment methodologies unreliable. There is a need for a comprehensive framework covering various models, optimization, and datasets, along with a reliable methodology to assess encoded norms.   We present LLM-CI, the first open-sourced framework to assess privacy norms encoded in LLMs. LLM-CI uses a Contextual Integrity-based factorial vignette methodology to assess the encoded norms across different contexts and LLMs. We propose the multi-prompt assessment methodology to address prompt sensitivity by assessing the norms from only the prompts that yield consistent responses across multiple variants. Using LLM-CI and our proposed methodology, we comprehensively evaluate LLMs using IoT and COPPA vignettes datasets from prior work, examining the impact of model properties (e.g., hyperparameters, capacity) and optimization strategies (e.g., alignment, quantization).|Yan Shvartzshnaider et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03735)|null|

In this work, we study this issue from both an economic and an algorithmic point of view, focusing on a phenomenon that reduces barriers to entry. Specifically, an incumbent company risks reputational damage unless its model is sufficiently aligned with safety objectives, whereas a new company can more easily avoid reputational damage. To study this issue formally, we define a multi-objective high-dimensional regression framework that captures reputational damage, and we characterize the number of data points that a new company needs to enter the market. Our results demonstrate how multi-objective considerations can fundamentally reduce barriers to entry -- the required number of data points can be significantly smaller than the incumbent company's dataset size. En route to proving these results, we develop scaling laws for high-dimensional linear regression in multi-objective environments, showing that the scaling rate becomes slower when the dataset size is large, which could be of independent interest.|Meena Jagadeesan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03734)|null|
|**2024-09-05**|**Planning In Natural Language Improves LLM Search For Code Generation**|While scaling training compute has led to remarkable improvements in large language models (LLMs), scaling inference compute has not yet yielded analogous gains. We hypothesize that a core missing component is a lack of diverse LLM outputs, leading to inefficient search due to models repeatedly sampling highly similar, yet incorrect generations. We empirically demonstrate that this lack of diversity can be mitigated by searching over candidate plans for solving a problem in natural language. Based on this insight, we propose PLANSEARCH, a novel search algorithm which shows strong results across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and LiveCodeBench (a contamination-free benchmark for competitive coding). PLANSEARCH generates a diverse set of observations about the problem and then uses these observations to construct plans for solving the problem. By searching over plans in natural language rather than directly over code solutions, PLANSEARCH explores a significantly more diverse range of potential solutions compared to baseline search methods. Using PLANSEARCH on top of Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves a state-of-the-art pass@200 of 77.0% on LiveCodeBench, outperforming both the best score achieved without search (pass@1 = 41.4%) and using standard repeated sampling (pass@200 = 60.6%). Finally, we show that, across all models, search algorithms, and benchmarks analyzed, we can accurately predict performance gains due to search as a direct function of the diversity over generated ideas.|Evan Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03733)|null|
|**2024-09-06**|**RAG based Question-Answering for Contextual Response Prediction System**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown versatility in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including their potential as effective question-answering systems. However, to provide precise and relevant information in response to specific customer queries in industry settings, LLMs require access to a comprehensive knowledge base to avoid hallucinations. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a promising technique to address this challenge. Yet, developing an accurate question-answering framework for real-world applications using RAG entails several challenges: 1) data availability issues, 2) evaluating the quality of generated content, and 3) the costly nature of human evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework that employs LLMs with RAG capabilities for industry use cases. Given a customer query, the proposed system retrieves relevant knowledge documents and leverages them, along with previous chat history, to generate response suggestions for customer service agents in the contact centers of a major retail company. Through comprehensive automated and human evaluations, we show that this solution outperforms the current BERT-based algorithms in accuracy and relevance. Our findings suggest that RAG-based LLMs can be an excellent support to human customer service representatives by lightening their workload.|Sriram Veturi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03708)|null|

|**2024-09-05**|**A Fused Large Language Model for Predicting Startup Success**|Investors are continuously seeking profitable investment opportunities in startups and, hence, for effective decision-making, need to predict a startup's probability of success. Nowadays, investors can use not only various fundamental information about a startup (e.g., the age of the startup, the number of founders, and the business sector) but also textual description of a startup's innovation and business model, which is widely available through online venture capital (VC) platforms such as Crunchbase. To support the decision-making of investors, we develop a machine learning approach with the aim of locating successful startups on VC platforms. Specifically, we develop, train, and evaluate a tailored, fused large language model to predict startup success. Thereby, we assess to what extent self-descriptions on VC platforms are predictive of startup success. Using 20,172 online profiles from Crunchbase, we find that our fused large language model can predict startup success, with textual self-descriptions being responsible for a significant part of the predictive power. Our work provides a decision support tool for investors to find profitable investment opportunities.|Abdurahman Maarouf et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03668)|null|
|**2024-09-05**|**The representation landscape of few-shot learning and fine-tuning in large language models**|In-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) are two common strategies for improving the performance of modern large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks. Despite their different natures, these strategies often lead to comparable performance gains. However, little is known about whether they induce similar representations inside LLMs. We approach this problem by analyzing the probability landscape of their hidden representations in the two cases. More specifically, we compare how LLMs solve the same question-answering task, finding that ICL and SFT create very different internal structures, in both cases undergoing a sharp transition in the middle of the network. In the first half of the network, ICL shapes interpretable representations hierarchically organized according to their semantic content. In contrast, the probability landscape obtained with SFT is fuzzier and semantically mixed. In the second half of the model, the fine-tuned representations develop probability modes that better encode the identity of answers, while the landscape of ICL representations is characterized by less defined peaks. Our approach reveals the diverse computational strategies developed inside LLMs to solve the same task across different conditions, allowing us to make a step towards designing optimal methods to extract information from language models.|Diego Doimo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03662)|**[link](https://github.com/diegodoimo/geometry_icl_finetuning)**|
|**2024-09-06**|**LLM-based multi-agent poetry generation in non-cooperative environments**|Despite substantial progress of large language models (LLMs) for automatic poetry generation, the generated poetry lacks diversity while the training process differs greatly from human learning. Under the rationale that the learning process of the poetry generation systems should be more human-like and their output more diverse and novel, we introduce a framework based on social learning where we emphasize non-cooperative interactions besides cooperative interactions to encourage diversity. Our experiments are the first attempt at LLM-based multi-agent systems in non-cooperative environments for poetry generation employing both TRAINING-BASED agents (GPT-2) and PROMPTING-BASED agents (GPT-3 and GPT-4). Our evaluation based on 96k generated poems shows that our framework benefits the poetry generation process for TRAINING-BASED agents resulting in 1) a 3.0-3.7 percentage point (pp) increase in diversity and a 5.6-11.3 pp increase in novelty according to distinct and novel n-grams. The generated poetry from TRAINING-BASED agents also exhibits group divergence in terms of lexicons, styles and semantics. PROMPTING-BASED agents in our framework also benefit from non-cooperative environments and a more diverse ensemble of models with non-homogeneous agents has the potential to further enhance diversity, with an increase of 7.0-17.5 pp according to our experiments. However, PROMPTING-BASED agents show a decrease in lexical diversity over time and do not exhibit the group-based divergence intended in the social network. Our paper argues for a paradigm shift in creative tasks such as automatic poetry generation to include social learning processes (via LLM-based agent modeling) similar to human interaction.|Ran Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03659)|**[link](https://github.com/zhangr2021/Multiagent_poetry)**|
|**2024-09-05**|**On the Limited Generalization Capability of the Implicit Reward Model Induced by Direct Preference Optimization**|Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an effective approach for aligning language models to human preferences. Central to RLHF is learning a reward function for scoring human preferences. Two main approaches for learning a reward model are 1) training an EXplicit Reward Model (EXRM) as in RLHF, and 2) using an implicit reward learned from preference data through methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Prior work has shown that the implicit reward model of DPO (denoted as DPORM) can approximate an EXRM in the limit. DPORM's effectiveness directly implies the optimality of the learned policy, and also has practical implication for LLM alignment methods including iterative DPO. However, it is unclear how well DPORM empirically matches the performance of EXRM. This work studies the accuracy at distinguishing preferred and rejected answers for both DPORM and EXRM. Our findings indicate that even though DPORM fits the training dataset comparably, it generalizes less effectively than EXRM, especially when the validation datasets contain distribution shifts. Across five out-of-distribution settings, DPORM has a mean drop in accuracy of 3% and a maximum drop of 7%. These findings highlight that DPORM has limited generalization ability and substantiates the integration of an explicit reward model in iterative DPO approaches.|Yong Lin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03650)|null|

In this work, we aim to enable long-context LLMs to generate responses with fine-grained sentence-level citations, improving their faithfulness and verifiability. We first introduce LongBench-Cite, an automated benchmark for assessing current LLMs' performance in Long-Context Question Answering with Citations (LQAC), revealing considerable room for improvement. To this end, we propose CoF (Coarse to Fine), a novel pipeline that utilizes off-the-shelf LLMs to automatically generate long-context QA instances with precise sentence-level citations, and leverage this pipeline to construct LongCite-45k, a large-scale SFT dataset for LQAC. Finally, we train LongCite-8B and LongCite-9B using the LongCite-45k dataset, successfully enabling their generation of accurate responses and fine-grained sentence-level citations in a single output. The evaluation results on LongBench-Cite show that our trained models achieve state-of-the-art citation quality, surpassing advanced proprietary models including GPT-4o.|Jiajie Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02897)|null|

|**2024-09-04**|**Configurable Foundation Models: Building LLMs from a Modular Perspective**|Advancements in LLMs have recently unveiled challenges tied to computational efficiency and continual scalability due to their requirements of huge parameters, making the applications and evolution of these models on devices with limited computation resources and scenarios requiring various abilities increasingly cumbersome. Inspired by modularity within the human brain, there is a growing tendency to decompose LLMs into numerous functional modules, allowing for inference with part of modules and dynamic assembly of modules to tackle complex tasks, such as mixture-of-experts. To highlight the inherent efficiency and composability of the modular approach, we coin the term brick to represent each functional module, designating the modularized structure as configurable foundation models. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive overview and investigation of the construction, utilization, and limitation of configurable foundation models. We first formalize modules into emergent bricks - functional neuron partitions that emerge during the pre-training phase, and customized bricks - bricks constructed via additional post-training to improve the capabilities and knowledge of LLMs. Based on diverse functional bricks, we further present four brick-oriented operations: retrieval and routing, merging, updating, and growing. These operations allow for dynamic configuration of LLMs based on instructions to handle complex tasks. To verify our perspective, we conduct an empirical analysis on widely-used LLMs. We find that the FFN layers follow modular patterns with functional specialization of neurons and functional neuron partitions. Finally, we highlight several open issues and directions for future research. Overall, this paper aims to offer a fresh modular perspective on existing LLM research and inspire the future creation of more efficient and scalable foundational models.|Chaojun Xiao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02877)|null|

To minimize the gap between the historic orthography and contemporary spelling, usually an automatic orthographic normalization of the historical source material is pursued. This report proposes a normalization system for German literary texts from c. 1700-1900, trained on a parallel corpus. The proposed system makes use of a machine learning approach using Transformer language models, combining an encoder-decoder model to normalize individual word types, and a pre-trained causal language model to adjust these normalizations within their context. An extensive evaluation shows that the proposed system provides state-of-the-art accuracy, comparable with a much larger fully end-to-end sentence-based normalization system, fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer large language model. However, the normalization of historical text remains a challenge due to difficulties for models to generalize, and the lack of extensive high-quality parallel data.|Anton Ehrmanntraut et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02841)|null|

|**2024-09-04**|**CMM-Math: A Chinese Multimodal Math Dataset To Evaluate and Enhance the Mathematics Reasoning of Large Multimodal Models**|Large language models (LLMs) have obtained promising results in mathematical reasoning, which is a foundational skill for human intelligence. Most previous studies focus on improving and measuring the performance of LLMs based on textual math reasoning datasets (e.g., MATH, GSM8K). Recently, a few researchers have released English multimodal math datasets (e.g., MATHVISTA and MATH-V) to evaluate the effectiveness of large multimodal models (LMMs). In this paper, we release a Chinese multimodal math (CMM-Math) dataset, including benchmark and training parts, to evaluate and enhance the mathematical reasoning of LMMs. CMM-Math contains over 28,000 high-quality samples, featuring a variety of problem types (e.g., multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and so on) with detailed solutions across 12 grade levels from elementary to high school in China. Specifically, the visual context may be present in the questions or opinions, which makes this dataset more challenging. Through comprehensive analysis, we discover that state-of-the-art LMMs on the CMM-Math dataset face challenges, emphasizing the necessity for further improvements in LMM development. We also propose a Multimodal Mathematical LMM (Math-LMM) to handle the problems with mixed input of multiple images and text segments. We train our model using three stages, including foundational pre-training, foundational fine-tuning, and mathematical fine-tuning. The extensive experiments indicate that our model effectively improves math reasoning performance by comparing it with the SOTA LMMs over three multimodal mathematical datasets.|Wentao Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02834)|null|
|**2024-09-04**|**ExpLLM: Towards Chain of Thought for Facial Expression Recognition**|Facial expression recognition (FER) is a critical task in multimedia with significant implications across various domains. However, analyzing the causes of facial expressions is essential for accurately recognizing them. Current approaches, such as those based on facial action units (AUs), typically provide AU names and intensities but lack insight into the interactions and relationships between AUs and the overall expression. In this paper, we propose a novel method called ExpLLM, which leverages large language models to generate an accurate chain of thought (CoT) for facial expression recognition. Specifically, we have designed the CoT mechanism from three key perspectives: key observations, overall emotional interpretation, and conclusion. The key observations describe the AU's name, intensity, and associated emotions. The overall emotional interpretation provides an analysis based on multiple AUs and their interactions, identifying the dominant emotions and their relationships. Finally, the conclusion presents the final expression label derived from the preceding analysis. Furthermore, we also introduce the Exp-CoT Engine, designed to construct this expression CoT and generate instruction-description data for training our ExpLLM. Extensive experiments on the RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets demonstrate that ExpLLM outperforms current state-of-the-art FER methods. ExpLLM also surpasses the latest GPT-4o in expression CoT generation, particularly in recognizing micro-expressions where GPT-4o frequently fails.|Xing Lan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02828)|null|

Combining two or more creative words, particularly those that contradict each other, can positively impact the creative process, sparking novel ideas and designs. As we move towards AI-driven design, an open question arises: do these design contradictions work positively with AI tools? Currently, the answer is no. AI systems, like large language models (LLMs), rely on algorithms that engender similarity, whereas creativity often requires divergence and novelty. This poster initiates a conversation on how to drive AI systems to be more creative and generate new ideas. This research invites us to reconsider traditional design methods and explore new approaches in an AI-driven world. Can we apply the same techniques used in traditional design, like the double diamond model, or do we need new methods for design engineering?

|**2024-08-30**|**SYNTHEVAL: Hybrid Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with Synthetic CheckLists**|Traditional benchmarking in NLP typically involves using static held-out test sets. However, this approach often results in an overestimation of performance and lacks the ability to offer comprehensive, interpretable, and dynamic assessments of NLP models. Recently, works like DynaBench (Kiela et al., 2021) and CheckList (Ribeiro et al., 2020) have addressed these limitations through behavioral testing of NLP models with test types generated by a multistep human-annotated pipeline. Unfortunately, manually creating a variety of test types requires much human labor, often at prohibitive cost. In this work, we propose SYNTHEVAL, a hybrid behavioral testing framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a wide range of test types for a comprehensive evaluation of NLP models. SYNTHEVAL first generates sentences via LLMs using controlled generation, and then identifies challenging examples by comparing the predictions made by LLMs with task-specific NLP models. In the last stage, human experts investigate the challenging examples, manually design templates, and identify the types of failures the taskspecific models consistently exhibit. We apply SYNTHEVAL to two classification tasks, sentiment analysis and toxic language detection, and show that our framework is effective in identifying weaknesses of strong models on these tasks.

|**2024-08-30**|**Advancing Multi-talker ASR Performance with Large Language Models**|Recognizing overlapping speech from multiple speakers in conversational scenarios is one of the most challenging problem for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Serialized output training (SOT) is a classic method to address multi-talker ASR, with the idea of concatenating transcriptions from multiple speakers according to the emission times of their speech for training. However, SOT-style transcriptions, derived from concatenating multiple related utterances in a conversation, depend significantly on modeling long contexts. Therefore, compared to traditional methods that primarily emphasize encoder performance in attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) architectures, a novel approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) that leverages the capabilities of pre-trained decoders may be better suited for such complex and challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based SOT approach for multi-talker ASR, leveraging pre-trained speech encoder and LLM, fine-tuning them on multi-talker dataset using appropriate strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional AED-based methods on the simulated dataset LibriMix and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the evaluation set of the real-world dataset AMI, outperforming the AED model trained with 1000 times more supervised data in previous works.|Mohan Shi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17431)|null|

Developers often explore competitors' apps to gather inspiration for new features. With the advance of Generative AI, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of large language model (LLM)-inspired requirements elicitation. LLMs can assist in this process by providing inspiration for new feature ideas. While both approaches are gaining popularity in practice, there is a lack of insight into their differences. We report on a comparative study between AppStore- and LLM-based approaches for refining features into sub-features. By manually analyzing 1,200 sub-features recommended from both approaches, we identified their benefits, challenges, and key differences. While both approaches recommend highly relevant sub-features with clear descriptions, LLMs seem more powerful particularly concerning novel unseen app scopes. Moreover, some recommended features are imaginary with unclear feasibility, which suggests the importance of a human-analyst in the elicitation loop.|Jialiang Wei et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17404)|null|
|**2024-08-30**|**NDP: Next Distribution Prediction as a More Broad Target**|Large language models (LLMs) trained on next-token prediction (NTP) paradigm have demonstrated powerful capabilities. However, the existing NTP paradigm contains several limitations, particularly related to planned task complications and error propagation during inference. In our work, we extend the critique of NTP, highlighting its limitation also due to training with a narrow objective: the prediction of a sub-optimal one-hot distribution. To support this critique, we conducted a pre-experiment treating the output distribution from powerful LLMs as efficient world data compression. By evaluating the similarity between the $n$-gram distribution and the one-hot distribution with LLMs, we observed that the $n$-gram distributions align more closely with the output distribution of LLMs. Based on this insight, we introduce Next Distribution Prediction (NDP), which uses $n$ -gram distributions to replace the one-hot targets, enhancing learning without extra online training time. We conducted experiments across translation, general task, language transfer, and medical domain adaptation. Compared to NTP, NDP can achieve up to +2.97 COMET improvement in translation tasks, +0.61 average improvement in general tasks, and incredible +10.75 average improvement in the medical domain. This demonstrates the concrete benefits of addressing the target narrowing problem, pointing to a new direction for future work on improving NTP.|Junhao Ruan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17377)|null|

Several popular community platforms now offer convenient distribution of a large variety of pre-trained models, allowing anyone to publish without rigorous verification. This scenario creates a privacy threat, as pre-trained models can be intentionally crafted to compromise the privacy of fine-tuning datasets. In this study, we introduce a novel poisoning technique that uses model-unlearning as an attack tool. This approach manipulates a pre-trained language model to increase the leakage of private data during the fine-tuning process. Our method enhances both membership inference and data extraction attacks while preserving model utility. Experimental results across different models, datasets, and fine-tuning setups demonstrate that our attacks significantly surpass baseline performance.

Data-driven predictive methods, especially those utilizing machine learning techniques, have emerged to handle these complexities in urban delivery demand management problems. One particularly pressing problem that has not yet been sufficiently studied is the joint estimation and prediction of city-wide delivery demand. To this end, we formulate this problem as a graph-based spatiotemporal learning task. First, a message-passing neural network model is formalized to capture the interaction between demand patterns of associated regions. Second, by exploiting recent advances in large language models, we extract general geospatial knowledge encodings from the unstructured locational data and integrate them into the demand predictor. Last, to encourage the cross-city transferability of the model, an inductive training scheme is developed in an end-to-end routine. Extensive empirical results on two real-world delivery datasets, including eight cities in China and the US, demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in these challenging tasks.|Tong Nie et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17258)|null|
|**2024-08-30**|**VisionTS: Visual Masked Autoencoders Are Free-Lunch Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters**|Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either fine-tune large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time-series datasets to develop TSF foundation models. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. In this paper, we explore a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich and high-quality natural images, based on the intrinsic similarities between images and time series. To bridge the gap between the two domains, we reformulate the TSF task as an image reconstruction task, which is further processed by a visual masked autoencoder (MAE) self-supervised pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time-series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to existing TSF foundation models. With minimal fine-tuning, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. These findings suggest that visual models could be a free lunch for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-domain research between computer vision and TSF.

|**2024-08-29**|**How Far Can Cantonese NLP Go? Benchmarking Cantonese Capabilities of Large Language Models**|The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the competitive landscape in natural language processing (NLP), particularly for English and other data-rich languages. However, underrepresented languages like Cantonese, spoken by over 85 million people, face significant development gaps, which is particularly concerning given the economic significance of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, and in substantial Cantonese-speaking populations in places like Singapore and North America. Despite its wide use, Cantonese has scant representation in NLP research, especially compared to other languages from similarly developed regions. To bridge these gaps, we outline current Cantonese NLP methods and introduce new benchmarks designed to evaluate LLM performance in factual generation, mathematical logic, complex reasoning, and general knowledge in Cantonese, which aim to advance open-source Cantonese LLM technology. We also propose future research directions and recommended models to enhance Cantonese LLM development.|Jiyue Jiang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16756)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**Reinforcement Learning without Human Feedback for Last Mile Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models**|Reinforcement learning is used to align language models with human preference signals after first pre-training the model to predict the next token of text within a large corpus using likelihood maximization. Before being deployed in a specific domain, models are often further fine-tuned on task specific data. Since human preferences are often unavailable for the last step, it is performed using likelihood maximization as that is the typical default method. However, reinforcement learning has other advantages besides facilitating alignment to a human derived reward function. For one, whereas likelihood maximization is a form of imitation learning in which the model is trained on what to do under ideal conditions, reinforcement learning is not limited to demonstrating actions just for optimally reached states and trains a model what to do under a range of scenarios as it explores the policy space. In addition, it also trains a model what not to do, suppressing competitive but poor actions. This work develops a framework for last-mile fine-tuning using reinforcement learning and tests whether it garners performance gains. The experiments center on abstractive summarization, but the framework is general and broadly applicable. Use of the procedure produced significantly better results than likelihood maximization when comparing raw predictions. For the specific data tested, the gap could be bridged by employing post-processing of the maximum likelihood outputs. Nonetheless, the framework offers a new avenue for model optimization in situations where post-processing may be less straightforward or effective, and it can be extended to include more complex classes of undesirable outputs to penalize and train against, such as hallucinations.|Alec Solway et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16753)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**Assessing Large Language Models for Online Extremism Research: Identification, Explanation, and New Knowledge**|The United States has experienced a significant increase in violent extremism, prompting the need for automated tools to detect and limit the spread of extremist ideology online. This study evaluates the performance of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) in detecting and classifying online domestic extremist posts. We collected social media posts containing "far-right" and "far-left" ideological keywords and manually labeled them as extremist or non-extremist. Extremist posts were further classified into one or more of five contributing elements of extremism based on a working definitional framework. The BERT model's performance was evaluated based on training data size and knowledge transfer between categories. We also compared the performance of GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 models using different prompts: na\"ive, layperson-definition, role-playing, and professional-definition. Results showed that the best performing GPT models outperformed the best performing BERT models, with more detailed prompts generally yielding better results. However, overly complex prompts may impair performance. Different versions of GPT have unique sensitives to what they consider extremist. GPT 3.5 performed better at classifying far-left extremist posts, while GPT 4 performed better at classifying far-right extremist posts. Large language models, represented by GPT models, hold significant potential for online extremism classification tasks, surpassing traditional BERT models in a zero-shot setting. Future research should explore human-computer interactions in optimizing GPT models for extremist detection and classification tasks to develop more efficient (e.g., quicker, less effort) and effective (e.g., fewer errors or mistakes) methods for identifying extremist content.|Beidi Dong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16749)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**Theoretical and Methodological Framework for Studying Texts Produced by Large Language Models**|This paper addresses the conceptual, methodological and technical challenges in studying large language models (LLMs) and the texts they produce from a quantitative linguistics perspective. It builds on a theoretical framework that distinguishes between the LLM as a substrate and the entities the model simulates. The paper advocates for a strictly non-anthropomorphic approach to models while cautiously applying methodologies used in studying human linguistic behavior to the simulated entities. While natural language processing researchers focus on the models themselves, their architecture, evaluation, and methods for improving performance, we as quantitative linguists should strive to build a robust theory concerning the characteristics of texts produced by LLMs, how they differ from human-produced texts, and the properties of simulated entities. Additionally, we should explore the potential of LLMs as an instrument for studying human culture, of which language is an integral part.|Jiří Milička et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16740)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**Smaller, Weaker, Yet Better: Training LLM Reasoners via Compute-Optimal Sampling**|Training on high-quality synthetic data from strong language models (LMs) is a common strategy to improve the reasoning performance of LMs. In this work, we revisit whether this strategy is compute-optimal under a fixed inference budget (e.g., FLOPs). To do so, we investigate the trade-offs between generating synthetic data using a stronger but more expensive (SE) model versus a weaker but cheaper (WC) model. We evaluate the generated data across three key metrics: coverage, diversity, and false positive rate, and show that the data from WC models may have higher coverage and diversity, but also exhibit higher false positive rates. We then finetune LMs on data from SE and WC models in different settings: knowledge distillation, self-improvement, and a novel weak-to-strong improvement setup where a weaker LM teaches reasoning to a stronger LM. Our findings reveal that models finetuned on WC-generated data consistently outperform those trained on SE-generated data across multiple benchmarks and multiple choices of WC and SE models. These results challenge the prevailing practice of relying on SE models for synthetic data generation, suggesting that WC may be the compute-optimal approach for training advanced LM reasoners.|Hritik Bansal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16737)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**VideoLLM-MoD: Efficient Video-Language Streaming with Mixture-of-Depths Vision Computation**|A well-known dilemma in large vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA) is that while increasing the number of vision tokens generally enhances visual understanding, it also significantly raises memory and computational costs, especially in long-term, dense video frame streaming scenarios. Although learnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed to reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled by LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when addressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce vision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens "skipping layers" rather than decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is inspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous vision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for each transformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion (e.g., 80\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. This approach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately \textasciitilde42\% time and \textasciitilde30\% memory savings for the entire training. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid decreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance compared to the vanilla model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasks in COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets.|Shiwei Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16730)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**GradBias: Unveiling Word Influence on Bias in Text-to-Image Generative Models**|Recent progress in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models has enabled high-quality image generation. As performance and accessibility increase, these models are gaining significant attraction and popularity: ensuring their fairness and safety is a priority to prevent the dissemination and perpetuation of biases. However, existing studies in bias detection focus on closed sets of predefined biases (e.g., gender, ethnicity). In this paper, we propose a general framework to identify, quantify, and explain biases in an open set setting, i.e. without requiring a predefined set. This pipeline leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to propose biases starting from a set of captions. Next, these captions are used by the target generative model for generating a set of images. Finally, Vision Question Answering (VQA) is leveraged for bias evaluation. We show two variations of this framework: OpenBias and GradBias. OpenBias detects and quantifies biases, while GradBias determines the contribution of individual prompt words on biases. OpenBias effectively detects both well-known and novel biases related to people, objects, and animals and highly aligns with existing closed-set bias detection methods and human judgment. GradBias shows that neutral words can significantly influence biases and it outperforms several baselines, including state-of-the-art foundation models.

|**2024-08-29**|**Entropic Distribution Matching in Supervised Fine-tuning of LLMs: Less Overfitting and Better Diversity**|Large language models rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to specialize in downstream tasks. Cross Entropy (CE) loss is the de facto choice in SFT, but it often leads to overfitting and limited output diversity due to its aggressive updates to the data distribution. This paper aim to address these issues by introducing the maximum entropy principle, which favors models with flatter distributions that still effectively capture the data. Specifically, we develop a new distribution matching method called GEM, which solves reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization with an entropy regularizer.   For the SFT of Llama-3-8B models, GEM outperforms CE in several aspects. First, when applied to the UltraFeedback dataset to develop general instruction-following abilities, GEM exhibits reduced overfitting, evidenced by lower perplexity and better performance on the IFEval benchmark. Furthermore, GEM enhances output diversity, leading to performance gains of up to 7 points on math reasoning and code generation tasks using best-of-n sampling, even without domain-specific data. Second, when fine-tuning with domain-specific datasets for math reasoning and code generation, GEM also shows less overfitting and improvements of up to 10 points compared with CE.|Ziniu Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16673)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**Iterative Graph Alignment**|By compressing diverse narratives, LLMs go beyond memorization, achieving intelligence by capturing generalizable causal relationships. However, they suffer from local 'representation gaps' due to insufficient training data diversity, limiting their real-world utility, especially in tasks requiring strict alignment to rules. Traditional alignment methods relying on heavy human annotations are inefficient and unscalable. Recent self-alignment techniques also fall short, as they often depend on self-selection based prompting and memorization-based learning. To address these issues, we introduce Iterative Graph Alignment (IGA), an annotation-free rule-based alignment algorithm. A teacher model (VLM) employs Iterative Graph Prompting (IGP) to create logical graphs and reference answers. The student model (LLM) identifies local knowledge gaps by attempting to align its responses with these references, collaborating with helper models to generate diverse answers. These aligned responses are then used for iterative supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our evaluations across five rule-based scenarios demonstrate IGP's effectiveness, with a 73.12\% alignment improvement in Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Llama3-8B-Instruct achieving an 86.20\% improvement, outperforming Claude Sonnet 3.5 in rule-based alignment.|Fangyuan Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16667)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**LLMs generate structurally realistic social networks but overestimate political homophily**|Generating social networks is essential for many applications, such as epidemic modeling and social simulations. Prior approaches either involve deep learning models, which require many observed networks for training, or stylized models, which are limited in their realism and flexibility. In contrast, LLMs offer the potential for zero-shot and flexible network generation. However, two key questions are: (1) are LLM's generated networks realistic, and (2) what are risks of bias, given the importance of demographics in forming social ties? To answer these questions, we develop three prompting methods for network generation and compare the generated networks to real social networks. We find that more realistic networks are generated with "local" methods, where the LLM constructs relations for one persona at a time, compared to "global" methods that construct the entire network at once. We also find that the generated networks match real networks on many characteristics, including density, clustering, community structure, and degree. However, we find that LLMs emphasize political homophily over all other types of homophily and overestimate political homophily relative to real-world measures.|Serina Chang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16629)|**[link](https://github.com/snap-stanford/llm-social-network)**|
