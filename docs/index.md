|**2025-03-25**|**Med3DVLM: An Efficient Vision-Language Model for 3D Medical Image Analysis**|Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in 2D medical image analysis, but extending them to 3D remains challenging due to the high computational demands of volumetric data and the difficulty of aligning 3D spatial features with clinical text. We present Med3DVLM, a 3D VLM designed to address these challenges through three key innovations: (1) DCFormer, an efficient encoder that uses decomposed 3D convolutions to capture fine-grained spatial features at scale; (2) SigLIP, a contrastive learning strategy with pairwise sigmoid loss that improves image-text alignment without relying on large negative batches; and (3) a dual-stream MLP-Mixer projector that fuses low- and high-level image features with text embeddings for richer multi-modal representations. We evaluate our model on the M3D dataset, which includes radiology reports and VQA data for 120,084 3D medical images. Results show that Med3DVLM achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks. For image-text retrieval, it reaches 61.00% R@1 on 2,000 samples, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art M3D model (19.10%). For report generation, it achieves a METEOR score of 36.42% (vs. 14.38%). In open-ended visual question answering (VQA), it scores 36.76% METEOR (vs. 33.58%), and in closed-ended VQA, it achieves 79.95% accuracy (vs. 75.78%). These results highlight Med3DVLM's ability to bridge the gap between 3D imaging and language, enabling scalable, multi-task reasoning across clinical applications.

|**2025-03-25**|**SeLIP: Similarity Enhanced Contrastive Language Image Pretraining for Multi-modal Head MRI**|Despite that deep learning (DL) methods have presented tremendous potential in many medical image analysis tasks, the practical applications of medical DL models are limited due to the lack of enough data samples with manual annotations. By noting that the clinical radiology examinations are associated with radiology reports that describe the images, we propose to develop a foundation model for multi-model head MRI by using contrastive learning on the images and the corresponding radiology findings. In particular, a contrastive learning framework is proposed, where a mixed syntax and semantic similarity matching metric is integrated to reduce the thirst of extreme large dataset in conventional contrastive learning framework. Our proposed similarity enhanced contrastive language image pretraining (SeLIP) is able to effectively extract more useful features. Experiments revealed that our proposed SeLIP performs well in many downstream tasks including image-text retrieval task, classification task, and image segmentation, which highlights the importance of considering the similarities among texts describing different images in developing medical image foundation models.|Zhiyang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19801)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**Image-to-Text for Medical Reports Using Adaptive Co-Attention and Triple-LSTM Module**|Medical report generation requires specialized expertise that general large models often fail to accurately capture. Moreover, the inherent repetition and similarity in medical data make it difficult for models to extract meaningful features, resulting in a tendency to overfit. So in this paper, we propose a multimodal model, Co-Attention Triple-LSTM Network (CA-TriNet), a deep learning model that combines transformer architectures with a Multi-LSTM network. Its Co-Attention module synergistically links a vision transformer with a text transformer to better differentiate medical images with similarities, augmented by an adaptive weight operator to catch and amplify image labels with minor similarities. Furthermore, its Triple-LSTM module refines generated sentences using targeted image objects. Extensive evaluations over three public datasets have demonstrated that CA-TriNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of comprehensive ability, even pre-trained large language models on some metrics.|Yishen Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18297)|null|
|**2025-03-23**|**Retrieval Augmented Generation and Understanding in Vision: A Survey and New Outlook**|Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal technique in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling access to external, reliable, and up-to-date knowledge sources. In the context of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), RAG has proven invaluable by augmenting model outputs with supplementary, relevant information, thus improving their quality. Recently, the potential of RAG has extended beyond natural language processing, with emerging methods integrating retrieval-augmented strategies into the computer vision (CV) domain. These approaches aim to address the limitations of relying solely on internal model knowledge by incorporating authoritative external knowledge bases, thereby improving both the understanding and generation capabilities of vision models. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV, focusing on two main areas: (I) visual understanding and (II) visual generation. In the realm of visual understanding, we systematically review tasks ranging from basic image recognition to complex applications such as medical report generation and multimodal question answering. For visual content generation, we examine the application of RAG in tasks related to image, video, and 3D generation. Furthermore, we explore recent advancements in RAG for embodied AI, with a particular focus on applications in planning, task execution, multimodal perception, interaction, and specialized domains. Given that the integration of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV is still in its early stages, we also highlight the key limitations of current approaches and propose future research directions to drive the development of this promising area.|Xu Zheng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18016)|null|
|**2025-03-20**|**UniCrossAdapter: Multimodal Adaptation of CLIP for Radiology Report Generation**|Automated radiology report generation aims to expedite the tedious and error-prone reporting process for radiologists. While recent works have made progress, learning to align medical images and textual findings remains challenging due to the relative scarcity of labeled medical data. For example, datasets for this task are much smaller than those used for image captioning in computer vision. In this work, we propose to transfer representations from CLIP, a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model, to better capture cross-modal semantics between images and texts. However, directly applying CLIP is suboptimal due to the domain gap between natural images and radiology. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce UniCrossAdapter, lightweight adapter modules that are incorporated into CLIP and fine-tuned on the target task while keeping base parameters fixed. The adapters are distributed across modalities and their interaction to enhance vision-language alignment. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, advancing state-of-the-art in radiology report generation. The proposed transfer learning framework provides a means of harnessing semantic knowledge from large-scale pre-trained models to tackle data-scarce medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/chauncey-tow/MRG-CLIP.|Yaxiong Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15940)|**[link](https://github.com/chauncey-tow/mrg-clip)**|
|**2025-03-20**|**UMIT: Unifying Medical Imaging Tasks via Vision-Language Models**|With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly in the field of medical image analysis, an increasing number of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are being widely applied to solve complex health and biomedical challenges. However, existing research has primarily focused on specific tasks or single modalities, which limits their applicability and generalization across diverse medical scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose UMIT, a unified multi-modal, multi-task VLM designed specifically for medical imaging tasks. UMIT is able to solve various tasks, including visual question answering, disease detection, and medical report generation. In addition, it is applicable to multiple imaging modalities (e.g., X-ray, CT and PET), covering a wide range of applications from basic diagnostics to complex lesion analysis. Moreover, UMIT supports both English and Chinese, expanding its applicability globally and ensuring accessibility to healthcare services in different linguistic contexts. To enhance the model's adaptability and task-handling capability, we design a unique two-stage training strategy and fine-tune UMIT with designed instruction templates. Through extensive empirical evaluation, UMIT outperforms previous methods in five tasks across multiple datasets. The performance of UMIT indicates that it can significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency, thus providing effective solutions for medical imaging applications.|Haiyang Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15892)|**[link](https://github.com/dz-osamu/UMIT)**|
|**2025-03-17**|**LEAVS: An LLM-based Labeler for Abdominal CT Supervision**|Extracting structured labels from radiology reports has been employed to create vision models to simultaneously detect several types of abnormalities. However, existing works focus mainly on the chest region. Few works have been investigated on abdominal radiology reports due to more complex anatomy and a wider range of pathologies in the abdomen. We propose LEAVS (Large language model Extractor for Abdominal Vision Supervision). This labeler can annotate the certainty of presence and the urgency of seven types of abnormalities for nine abdominal organs on CT radiology reports. To ensure broad coverage, we chose abnormalities that encompass most of the finding types from CT reports. Our approach employs a specialized chain-of-thought prompting strategy for a locally-run LLM using sentence extraction and multiple-choice questions in a tree-based decision system. We demonstrate that the LLM can extract several abnormality types across abdominal organs with an average F1 score of 0.89, significantly outperforming competing labelers and humans. Additionally, we show that extraction of urgency labels achieved performance comparable to human annotations. Finally, we demonstrate that the abnormality labels contain valuable information for training a single vision model that classifies several organs as normal or abnormal. We release our code and structured annotations for a public CT dataset containing over 1,000 CT volumes.|Ricardo Bigolin Lanfredi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13330)|**[link](https://github.com/rsummers11/LEAVS)**|
|**2025-03-15**|**Language Models for Automated Classification of Brain MRI Reports and Growth Chart Generation**|Clinically acquired brain MRIs and radiology reports are valuable but underutilized resources due to the challenges of manual analysis and data heterogeneity. We developed fine-tuned language models (LMs) to classify brain MRI reports as normal (reports with limited pathology) or abnormal, fine-tuning BERT, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, and RadBERT on 44,661 reports. We also explored the reasoning capabilities of a leading LM, Gemini 1.5-Pro, for normal report categorization. Automated image processing and modeling generated brain growth charts from LM-classified normal scans, comparing them to human-derived charts. Fine-tuned LMs achieved high classification performance (F1-Score >97%), with unbalanced training mitigating class imbalance. Performance was robust on out-of-distribution data, with full text outperforming summary (impression) sections. Gemini 1.5-Pro showed a promising categorization performance, especially with clinical inference. LM-derived brain growth charts were nearly identical to human-annotated charts (r = 0.99, p < 2.2e-16). Our LMs offer scalable analysis of radiology reports, enabling automated classification of brain MRIs in large datasets. One application is automated generation of brain growth charts for benchmarking quantitative image features. Further research is needed to address data heterogeneity and optimize LM reasoning.|Maryam Daniali et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12143)|null|
|**2025-03-20**|**Applications of Large Language Model Reasoning in Feature Generation**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing through their state of art reasoning capabilities. This paper explores the convergence of LLM reasoning techniques and feature generation for machine learning tasks. We examine four key reasoning approaches: Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Thought Space Exploration. Our analysis reveals how these approaches can be used to identify effective feature generation rules without having to manually specify search spaces. The paper categorizes LLM-based feature generation methods across various domains including finance, healthcare, and text analytics. LLMs can extract key information from clinical notes and radiology reports in healthcare, by enabling more efficient data utilization. In finance, LLMs facilitate text generation, summarization, and entity extraction from complex documents. We analyze evaluation methodologies for assessing feature quality and downstream performance, with particular attention to OCTree's decision tree reasoning approach that provides language-based feedback for iterative improvements. Current challenges include hallucination, computational efficiency, and domain adaptation. As of March 2025, emerging approaches include inference-time compute scaling, reinforcement learning, and supervised fine-tuning with model distillation. Future directions point toward multimodal feature generation, self-improving systems, and neuro-symbolic approaches. This paper provides a detailed overview of an emerging field that promises to automate and enhance feature engineering through language model reasoning.|Dharani Chandra et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11989)|null|
|**2025-02-21**|**CSTRL: Context-Driven Sequential Transfer Learning for Abstractive Radiology Report Summarization**|A radiology report comprises several sections, including the Findings and Impression of the diagnosis. Automatically generating the Impression from the Findings is crucial for reducing radiologists' workload and improving diagnostic accuracy. Pretrained models that excel in common abstractive summarization problems encounter challenges when applied to specialized medical domains largely due to the complex terminology and the necessity for accurate clinical context. Such tasks in medical domains demand extracting core information, avoiding context shifts, and maintaining proper flow. Misuse of medical terms can lead to drastic clinical errors. To address these issues, we introduce a sequential transfer learning that ensures key content extraction and coherent summarization. Sequential transfer learning often faces challenges like initial parameter decay and knowledge loss, which we resolve with the Fisher matrix regularization. Using MIMIC-CXR and Open-I datasets, our model, CSTRL-Context-driven Sequential TRansfer Learning-achieved state-of-the-art performance, showing 56.2% improvement in BLEU-1, 40.5% in BLEU-2, 84.3% in BLEU-3, 28.9% in ROUGE-1, 41.0% in ROUGE-2 and 26.5% in ROGUE-3 score over benchmark studies. We also analyze factual consistency scores while preserving the medical context. Our code is publicly available at TBA.|Mst. Fahmida Sultana Naznin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05750)|null|
|**2025-03-07**|**GEMA-Score: Granular Explainable Multi-Agent Score for Radiology Report Evaluation**|Automatic medical report generation supports clinical diagnosis, reduces the workload of radiologists, and holds the promise of improving diagnosis consistency. However, existing evaluation metrics primarily assess the accuracy of key medical information coverage in generated reports compared to human-written reports, while overlooking crucial details such as the location and certainty of reported abnormalities. These limitations hinder the comprehensive assessment of the reliability of generated reports and pose risks in their selection for clinical use. Therefore, we propose a Granular Explainable Multi-Agent Score (GEMA-Score) in this paper, which conducts both objective quantification and subjective evaluation through a large language model-based multi-agent workflow. Our GEMA-Score parses structured reports and employs NER-F1 calculations through interactive exchanges of information among agents to assess disease diagnosis, location, severity, and uncertainty. Additionally, an LLM-based scoring agent evaluates completeness, readability, and clinical terminology while providing explanatory feedback. Extensive experiments validate that GEMA-Score achieves the highest correlation with human expert evaluations on a public dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in clinical scoring (Kendall coefficient = 0.70 for Rexval dataset and Kendall coefficient = 0.54 for RadEvalX dataset).

|**2025-03-07**|**ModernBERT is More Efficient than Conventional BERT for Chest CT Findings Classification in Japanese Radiology Reports**|Objective: This study aims to evaluate and compare the performance of two Japanese language models-conventional Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and the newer ModernBERT-in classifying findings from chest CT reports, with a focus on tokenization efficiency, processing time, and classification performance. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using the CT-RATE-JPN dataset containing 22,778 training reports and 150 test reports. Both models were fine-tuned for multi-label classification of 18 common chest CT conditions. The training data was split in 18,222:4,556 for training and validation. Performance was evaluated using F1 scores for each condition and exact match accuracy across all 18 labels. Results: ModernBERT demonstrated superior tokenization efficiency, requiring 24.0% fewer tokens per document (258.1 vs. 339.6) compared to BERT Base. This translated to significant performance improvements, with ModernBERT completing training in 1877.67 seconds versus BERT's 3090.54 seconds (39% reduction). ModernBERT processed 38.82 samples per second during training (1.65x faster) and 139.90 samples per second during inference (1.66x faster). Despite these efficiency gains, classification performance remained comparable, with ModernBERT achieving superior F1 scores in 8 conditions, while BERT performed better in 4 conditions. Overall exact match accuracy was slightly higher for ModernBERT (74.67% vs. 72.67%), though this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.6291). Conclusion: ModernBERT offers substantial improvements in tokenization efficiency and training speed without sacrificing classification performance. These results suggest that ModernBERT is a promising candidate for clinical applications in Japanese radiology reports analysis.|Yosuke Yamagishi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05060)|null|
|**2025-03-06**|**RadIR: A Scalable Framework for Multi-Grained Medical Image Retrieval via Radiology Report Mining**|Developing advanced medical imaging retrieval systems is challenging due to the varying definitions of `similar images' across different medical contexts. This challenge is compounded by the lack of large-scale, high-quality medical imaging retrieval datasets and benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that leverages dense radiology reports to define image-wise similarity ordering at multiple granularities in a scalable and fully automatic manner. Using this approach, we construct two comprehensive medical imaging retrieval datasets: MIMIC-IR for Chest X-rays and CTRATE-IR for CT scans, providing detailed image-image ranking annotations conditioned on diverse anatomical structures. Furthermore, we develop two retrieval systems, RadIR-CXR and model-ChestCT, which demonstrate superior performance in traditional image-image and image-report retrieval tasks. These systems also enable flexible, effective image retrieval conditioned on specific anatomical structures described in text, achieving state-of-the-art results on 77 out of 78 metrics.|Tengfei Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04653)|null|
|**2025-03-11**|**X2CT-CLIP: Enable Multi-Abnormality Detection in Computed Tomography from Chest Radiography via Tri-Modal Contrastive Learning**|Computed tomography (CT) is a key imaging modality for diagnosis, yet its clinical utility is marred by high radiation exposure and long turnaround times, restricting its use for larger-scale screening. Although chest radiography (CXR) is more accessible and safer, existing CXR foundation models focus primarily on detecting diseases that are readily visible on the CXR. Recently, works have explored training disease classification models on simulated CXRs, but they remain limited to recognizing a single disease type from CT. CT foundation models have also emerged with significantly improved detection of pathologies in CT. However, the generalized application of CT-derived labels on CXR has remained illusive. In this study, we propose X2CT-CLIP, a tri-modal knowledge transfer learning framework that bridges the modality gap between CT and CXR while reducing the computational burden of model training. Our approach is the first work to enable multi-abnormality classification in CT, using CXR, by transferring knowledge from 3D CT volumes and associated radiology reports to a CXR encoder via a carefully designed tri-modal alignment mechanism in latent space. Extensive evaluations on three multi-label CT datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cross-modal retrieval, few-shot adaptation, and external validation. These results highlight the potential of CXR, enriched with knowledge derived from CT, as a viable efficient alternative for disease detection in resource-limited settings.|Jianzhong You et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02162)|null|
|**2025-03-03**|**Abn-BLIP: Abnormality-aligned Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training for Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis and Report Generation from CTPA**|Medical imaging plays a pivotal role in modern healthcare, with computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) being a critical tool for diagnosing pulmonary embolism and other thoracic conditions. However, the complexity of interpreting CTPA scans and generating accurate radiology reports remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Abn-BLIP (Abnormality-aligned Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining), an advanced diagnosis model designed to align abnormal findings to generate the accuracy and comprehensiveness of radiology reports. By leveraging learnable queries and cross-modal attention mechanisms, our model demonstrates superior performance in detecting abnormalities, reducing missed findings, and generating structured reports compared to existing methods. Our experiments show that Abn-BLIP outperforms state-of-the-art medical vision-language models and 3D report generation methods in both accuracy and clinical relevance. These results highlight the potential of integrating multimodal learning strategies for improving radiology reporting.

|**2025-03-06**|**MedUnifier: Unifying Vision-and-Language Pre-training on Medical Data with Vision Generation Task using Discrete Visual Representations**|Despite significant progress in Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP), current approaches predominantly emphasize feature extraction and cross-modal comprehension, with limited attention to generating or transforming visual content. This gap hinders the model's ability to synthesize coherent and novel visual representations from textual prompts, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multi-modal learning. In this work, we propose MedUnifier, a unified VLP framework tailored for medical data. MedUnifier seamlessly integrates text-grounded image generation capabilities with multi-modal learning strategies, including image-text contrastive alignment, image-text matching and image-grounded text generation. Unlike traditional methods that reply on continuous visual representations, our approach employs visual vector quantization, which not only facilitates a more cohesive learning strategy for cross-modal understanding but also enhances multi-modal generation quality by effectively leveraging discrete representations. Our framework's effectiveness is evidenced by the experiments on established benchmarks, including uni-modal tasks (supervised fine-tuning), cross-modal tasks (image-text retrieval and zero-shot image classification), and multi-modal tasks (medical report generation, image synthesis), where it achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. MedUnifier also offers a highly adaptable tool for a wide range of language and vision tasks in healthcare, marking advancement toward the development of a generalizable AI model for medical applications.|Ziyang Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01019)|null|
|**2025-03-02**|**Patient-Level Anatomy Meets Scanning-Level Physics: Personalized Federated Low-Dose CT Denoising Empowered by Large Language Model**|Reducing radiation doses benefits patients, however, the resultant low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) images often suffer from clinically unacceptable noise and artifacts. While deep learning (DL) shows promise in LDCT reconstruction, it requires large-scale data collection from multiple clients, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) has been introduced to address these privacy concerns; however, current methods are typically tailored to specific scanning protocols, which limits their generalizability and makes them less effective for unseen protocols. To address these issues, we propose SCAN-PhysFed, a novel SCanning- and ANatomy-level personalized Physics-Driven Federated learning paradigm for LDCT reconstruction. Since the noise distribution in LDCT data is closely tied to scanning protocols and anatomical structures being scanned, we design a dual-level physics-informed way to address these challenges. Specifically, we incorporate physical and anatomical prompts into our physics-informed hypernetworks to capture scanning- and anatomy-specific information, enabling dual-level physics-driven personalization of imaging features. These prompts are derived from the scanning protocol and the radiology report generated by a medical large language model (MLLM), respectively. Subsequently, client-specific decoders project these dual-level personalized imaging features back into the image domain. Besides, to tackle the challenge of unseen data, we introduce a novel protocol vector-quantization strategy (PVQS), which ensures consistent performance across new clients by quantifying the unseen scanning code as one of the codes in the scanning codebook. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SCAN-PhysFed on public datasets.|Ziyuan Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00908)|null|
|**2025-02-27**|**Towards Statistical Factuality Guarantee for Large Vision-Language Models**|Advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in a variety of vision-language tasks involving image-conditioned free-form text generation. However, growing concerns about hallucinations in LVLMs, where the generated text is inconsistent with the visual context, are becoming a major impediment to deploying these models in applications that demand guaranteed reliability. In this paper, we introduce a framework to address this challenge, ConfLVLM, which is grounded on conformal prediction to achieve finite-sample distribution-free statistical guarantees on the factuality of LVLM output. This framework treats an LVLM as a hypothesis generator, where each generated text detail (or claim) is considered an individual hypothesis. It then applies a statistical hypothesis testing procedure to verify each claim using efficient heuristic uncertainty measures to filter out unreliable claims before returning any responses to users. We conduct extensive experiments covering three representative application domains, including general scene understanding, medical radiology report generation, and document understanding. Remarkably, ConfLVLM reduces the error rate of claims generated by LLaVa-1.5 for scene descriptions from 87.8\% to 10.0\% by filtering out erroneous claims with a 95.3\% true positive rate. Our results further demonstrate that ConfLVLM is highly flexible, and can be applied to any black-box LVLMs paired with any uncertainty measure for any image-conditioned free-form text generation task while providing a rigorous guarantee on controlling the risk of hallucination.|Zhuohang Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20560)|null|
|**2025-02-27**|**Enhanced Contrastive Learning with Multi-view Longitudinal Data for Chest X-ray Report Generation**|Automated radiology report generation offers an effective solution to alleviate radiologists' workload. However, most existing methods focus primarily on single or fixed-view images to model current disease conditions, which limits diagnostic accuracy and overlooks disease progression. Although some approaches utilize longitudinal data to track disease progression, they still rely on single images to analyze current visits. To address these issues, we propose enhanced contrastive learning with Multi-view Longitudinal data to facilitate chest X-ray Report Generation, named MLRG. Specifically, we introduce a multi-view longitudinal contrastive learning method that integrates spatial information from current multi-view images and temporal information from longitudinal data. This method also utilizes the inherent spatiotemporal information of radiology reports to supervise the pre-training of visual and textual representations. Subsequently, we present a tokenized absence encoding technique to flexibly handle missing patient-specific prior knowledge, allowing the model to produce more accurate radiology reports based on available prior knowledge. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR, MIMIC-ABN, and Two-view CXR datasets demonstrate that our MLRG outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 2.3% BLEU-4 improvement on MIMIC-CXR, a 5.5% F1 score improvement on MIMIC-ABN, and a 2.7% F1 RadGraph improvement on Two-view CXR.|Kang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20056)|**[link](https://github.com/mk-runner/MLRG)**|
|**2025-02-14**|**PolyPath: Adapting a Large Multimodal Model for Multi-slide Pathology Report Generation**|The interpretation of histopathology cases underlies many important diagnostic and treatment decisions in medicine. Notably, this process typically requires pathologists to integrate and summarize findings across multiple slides per case. Existing vision-language capabilities in computational pathology have so far been largely limited to small regions of interest, larger regions at low magnification, or single whole-slide images (WSIs). This limits interpretation of findings that span multiple high-magnification regions across multiple WSIs. By making use of Gemini 1.5 Flash, a large multimodal model (LMM) with a 1-million token context window, we demonstrate the ability to generate bottom-line diagnoses from up to 40,000 768x768 pixel image patches from multiple WSIs at 10X magnification. This is the equivalent of up to 11 hours of video at 1 fps. Expert pathologist evaluations demonstrate that the generated report text is clinically accurate and equivalent to or preferred over the original reporting for 68% (95% CI: [60%, 76%]) of multi-slide examples with up to 5 slides. While performance decreased for examples with 6 or more slides, this study demonstrates the promise of leveraging the long-context capabilities of modern LMMs for the uniquely challenging task of medical report generation where each case can contain thousands of image patches.|Faruk Ahmed et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10536)|null|
|**2025-02-13**|**From large language models to multimodal AI: A scoping review on the potential of generative AI in medicine**|Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as diffusion models and OpenAI's ChatGPT, are transforming medicine by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and automating clinical workflows. The field has advanced rapidly, evolving from text-only large language models for tasks such as clinical documentation and decision support to multimodal AI systems capable of integrating diverse data modalities, including imaging, text, and structured data, within a single model. The diverse landscape of these technologies, along with rising interest, highlights the need for a comprehensive review of their applications and potential. This scoping review explores the evolution of multimodal AI, highlighting its methods, applications, datasets, and evaluation in clinical settings. Adhering to PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we systematically queried PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science, prioritizing recent studies published up to the end of 2024. After rigorous screening, 144 papers were included, revealing key trends and challenges in this dynamic field. Our findings underscore a shift from unimodal to multimodal approaches, driving innovations in diagnostic support, medical report generation, drug discovery, and conversational AI. However, critical challenges remain, including the integration of heterogeneous data types, improving model interpretability, addressing ethical concerns, and validating AI systems in real-world clinical settings. This review summarizes the current state of the art, identifies critical gaps, and provides insights to guide the development of scalable, trustworthy, and clinically impactful multimodal AI solutions in healthcare.|Lukas Buess et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09242)|null|
|**2025-02-09**|**A Generative Framework for Bidirectional Image-Report Understanding in Chest Radiography**|The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked their potential for multimodal tasks, where text and visual data are processed jointly. However, applying LLMs to medical imaging, particularly for chest X-rays (CXR), poses significant challenges due to the need for precise visual-textual alignment and the preservation of critical diagnostic details. In this paper, we propose Multi-Stage Adaptive Vision-Language Tuning (MAViLT), a novel framework designed to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation for CXR understanding. MAViLT incorporates a clinical gradient-weighted tokenization process and a hierarchical fine-tuning strategy, enabling it to generate accurate radiology reports, synthesize realistic CXRs from text, and answer vision-based clinical questions. We evaluate MAViLT on two benchmark datasets, MIMIC-CXR and Indiana University CXR, achieving state-of-the-art results across all tasks. Human evaluations further validate the clinical relevance and utility of MAViLT, making it a robust tool for real-world medical applications. This work demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging LLMs for multimodal medical imaging while addressing key challenges in vision-language integration.|Nicholas Evans et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05926)|null|
|**2025-02-04**|**CoRPA: Adversarial Image Generation for Chest X-rays Using Concept Vector Perturbations and Generative Models**|Deep learning models for medical image classification tasks are becoming widely implemented in AI-assisted diagnostic tools, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce clinician workloads, and improve patient outcomes. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses significant risks to patient safety. Current attack methodologies use general techniques such as model querying or pixel value perturbations to generate adversarial examples designed to fool a model. These approaches may not adequately address the unique characteristics of clinical errors stemming from missed or incorrectly identified clinical features. We propose the Concept-based Report Perturbation Attack (CoRPA), a clinically-focused black-box adversarial attack framework tailored to the medical imaging domain. CoRPA leverages clinical concepts to generate adversarial radiological reports and images that closely mirror realistic clinical misdiagnosis scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of CoRPA using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset of chest X-rays and radiological reports. Our evaluation reveals that deep learning models exhibiting strong resilience to conventional adversarial attacks are significantly less robust when subjected to CoRPA's clinically-focused perturbations. This underscores the importance of addressing domain-specific vulnerabilities in medical AI systems. By introducing a specialized adversarial attack framework, this study provides a foundation for developing robust, real-world-ready AI models in healthcare, ensuring their safe and reliable deployment in high-stakes clinical environments.|Amy Rafferty et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05214)|null|

However, extending VLMs to 3D medical imaging remains computationally challenging. Existing 3D VLMs rely on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which are computationally expensive due to self-attention's quadratic complexity, or 3D convolutions, which demand excessive parameters and FLOPs as kernel size increases. We introduce DCFormer, an efficient 3D medical image encoder that factorizes 3D convolutions into three parallel 1D convolutions along depth, height, and width. This design preserves spatial information while significantly reducing computational cost. Integrated into a CLIP-based vision-language framework, DCFormer is evaluated on CT-RATE, a dataset of 50,188 paired 3D chest CT volumes and radiology reports, for zero-shot multi-abnormality detection across 18 pathologies. Compared to ViT, ConvNeXt, PoolFormer, and TransUNet, DCFormer achieves superior efficiency and accuracy, with DCFormer-Tiny reaching 62.0% accuracy and a 46.3% F1-score while using significantly fewer parameters. These results highlight DCFormer's potential for scalable, clinically deployable 3D medical VLMs. Our codes will be publicly available.|Gorkem Can Ates et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05091)|null|
|**2025-02-04**|**Medical Multimodal Model Stealing Attacks via Adversarial Domain Alignment**|Medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are becoming an instrumental part of healthcare systems, assisting medical personnel with decision making and results analysis. Models for radiology report generation are able to interpret medical imagery, thus reducing the workload of radiologists. As medical data is scarce and protected by privacy regulations, medical MLLMs represent valuable intellectual property. However, these assets are potentially vulnerable to model stealing, where attackers aim to replicate their functionality via black-box access. So far, model stealing for the medical domain has focused on classification; however, existing attacks are not effective against MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce Adversarial Domain Alignment (ADA-STEAL), the first stealing attack against medical MLLMs. ADA-STEAL relies on natural images, which are public and widely available, as opposed to their medical counterparts. We show that data augmentation with adversarial noise is sufficient to overcome the data distribution gap between natural images and the domain-specific distribution of the victim MLLM. Experiments on the IU X-RAY and MIMIC-CXR radiology datasets demonstrate that Adversarial Domain Alignment enables attackers to steal the medical MLLM without any access to medical data.|Yaling Shen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02438)|null|
|**2025-02-02**|**Agent-Based Uncertainty Awareness Improves Automated Radiology Report Labeling with an Open-Source Large Language Model**|Reliable extraction of structured data from radiology reports using Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging, especially for complex, non-English texts like Hebrew. This study introduces an agent-based uncertainty-aware approach to improve the trustworthiness of LLM predictions in medical applications. We analyzed 9,683 Hebrew radiology reports from Crohn's disease patients (from 2010 to 2023) across three medical centers. A subset of 512 reports was manually annotated for six gastrointestinal organs and 15 pathological findings, while the remaining reports were automatically annotated using HSMP-BERT. Structured data extraction was performed using Llama 3.1 (Llama 3-8b-instruct) with Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (BayesPE), which employed six semantically equivalent prompts to estimate uncertainty. An Agent-Based Decision Model integrated multiple prompt outputs into five confidence levels for calibrated uncertainty and was compared against three entropy-based models. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and Cohen's Kappa before and after filtering high-uncertainty cases. The agent-based model outperformed the baseline across all metrics, achieving an F1 score of 0.3967, recall of 0.6437, and Cohen's Kappa of 0.3006. After filtering high-uncertainty cases (greater than or equal to 0.5), the F1 score improved to 0.4787, and Kappa increased to 0.4258. Uncertainty histograms demonstrated clear separation between correct and incorrect predictions, with the agent-based model providing the most well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. By incorporating uncertainty-aware prompt ensembles and an agent-based decision model, this approach enhances the performance and reliability of LLMs in structured data extraction from radiology reports, offering a more interpretable and trustworthy solution for high-stakes medical applications.|Hadas Ben-Atya et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01691)|null|
|**2025-02-01**|**Vision-Language Modeling in PET/CT for Visual Grounding of Positive Findings**|Vision-language models can connect the text description of an object to its specific location in an image through visual grounding. This has potential applications in enhanced radiology reporting. However, these models require large annotated image-text datasets, which are lacking for PET/CT. We developed an automated pipeline to generate weak labels linking PET/CT report descriptions to their image locations and used it to train a 3D vision-language visual grounding model. Our pipeline finds positive findings in PET/CT reports by identifying mentions of SUVmax and axial slice numbers. From 25,578 PET/CT exams, we extracted 11,356 sentence-label pairs. Using this data, we trained ConTEXTual Net 3D, which integrates text embeddings from a large language model with a 3D nnU-Net via token-level cross-attention. The model's performance was compared against LLMSeg, a 2.5D version of ConTEXTual Net, and two nuclear medicine physicians. The weak-labeling pipeline accurately identified lesion locations in 98% of cases (246/251), with 7.5% requiring boundary adjustments. ConTEXTual Net 3D achieved an F1 score of 0.80, outperforming LLMSeg (F1=0.22) and the 2.5D model (F1=0.53), though it underperformed both physicians (F1=0.94 and 0.91). The model achieved better performance on FDG (F1=0.78) and DCFPyL (F1=0.75) exams, while performance dropped on DOTATE (F1=0.58) and Fluciclovine (F1=0.66). The model performed consistently across lesion sizes but showed reduced accuracy on lesions with low uptake. Our novel weak labeling pipeline accurately produced an annotated dataset of PET/CT image-text pairs, facilitating the development of 3D visual grounding models. ConTEXTual Net 3D significantly outperformed other models but fell short of the performance of nuclear medicine physicians. Our study suggests that even larger datasets may be needed to close this performance gap.|Zachary Huemann et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00528)|null|
|**2025-01-24**|**Large-scale and Fine-grained Vision-language Pre-training for Enhanced CT Image Understanding**|Artificial intelligence (AI) shows great potential in assisting radiologists to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical image interpretation and diagnosis. However, a versatile AI model requires large-scale data and comprehensive annotations, which are often impractical in medical settings. Recent studies leverage radiology reports as a naturally high-quality supervision for medical images, using contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) to develop language-informed models for radiological image interpretation. Nonetheless, these approaches typically contrast entire images with reports, neglecting the local associations between imaging regions and report sentences, which may undermine model performance and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained vision-language model (fVLM) for anatomy-level CT image interpretation. Specifically, we explicitly match anatomical regions of CT images with corresponding descriptions in radiology reports and perform contrastive pre-training for each anatomy individually. Fine-grained alignment, however, faces considerable false-negative challenges, mainly from the abundance of anatomy-level healthy samples and similarly diseased abnormalities. To tackle this issue, we propose identifying false negatives of both normal and abnormal samples and calibrating contrastive learning from patient-level to disease-aware pairing. We curated the largest CT dataset to date, comprising imaging and report data from 69,086 patients, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 54 major and important disease diagnosis tasks across 15 main anatomies. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial potential of fVLM in versatile medical image interpretation. In the zero-shot classification task, we achieved an average AUC of 81.3% on 54 diagnosis tasks, surpassing CLIP and supervised methods by 12.9% and 8.0%, respectively.|Zhongyi Shui et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14548)|**[link](https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/fvlm)**|

It significantly impacts quality of life and is often difficult to assess due to its subjective nature in clinical evaluation. We introduce PARASIDE, an automatic tool for segmenting air and soft tissue volumes of the structures of the sinus maxillaris, frontalis, sphenodalis and ethmoidalis in T1 MRI. By utilizing that segmentation, we can quantify feature relations that have been observed only manually and subjectively before. We performed an exemplary study and showed both volume and intensity relations between structures and radiology reports. While the soft tissue segmentation is good, the automated annotations of the air volumes are excellent. The average intensity over air structures are consistently below those of the soft tissues, close to perfect separability. Healthy subjects exhibit lower soft tissue volumes and lower intensities. Our developed system is the first automated whole nasal segmentation of 16 structures, and capable of calculating medical relevant features such as the Lund-Mackay score.|Hendrik Möller et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14514)|null|

However, the manual generation of unstructured medical reports is time consuming and prone to errors. It creates a significant bottleneck in clinical workflows. Despite advancements in AI-generated radiology reports, challenges remain in achieving detailed and accurate report generation. In this study we have evaluated different combinations of multimodal models that integrate Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to generate comprehensive radiology reports. We employed a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT-B16) and a SWIN Transformer as the image encoders. The BART and GPT-2 models serve as the textual decoders. We used Chest X-ray images and reports from the IU-Xray dataset to evaluate the usability of the SWIN Transformer-BART, SWIN Transformer-GPT-2, ViT-B16-BART and ViT-B16-GPT-2 models for report generation. We aimed at finding the best combination among the models. The SWIN-BART model performs as the best-performing model among the four models achieving remarkable results in almost all the evaluation metrics like ROUGE, BLEU and BERTScore.|Md.

|**2025-01-13**|**RadAlign: Advancing Radiology Report Generation with Vision-Language Concept Alignment**|Automated chest radiographs interpretation requires both accurate disease classification and detailed radiology report generation, presenting a significant challenge in the clinical workflow. Current approaches either focus on classification accuracy at the expense of interpretability or generate detailed but potentially unreliable reports through image captioning techniques. In this study, we present RadAlign, a novel framework that combines the predictive accuracy of vision-language models (VLMs) with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the radiologist's workflow, RadAlign first employs a specialized VLM to align visual features with key medical concepts, achieving superior disease classification with an average AUC of 0.885 across multiple diseases. These recognized medical conditions, represented as text-based concepts in the aligned visual-language space, are then used to prompt LLM-based report generation. Enhanced by a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism that grounds outputs in similar historical cases, RadAlign delivers superior report quality with a GREEN score of 0.678, outperforming state-of-the-art methods' 0.634. Our framework maintains strong clinical interpretability while reducing hallucinations, advancing automated medical imaging and report analysis through integrated predictive and generative AI.

However, its adaptation in medical settings still faces significant challenges, related to data availability and privacy constraints. Synthetic data has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these issues, addressing data scarcity while preserving privacy. Recently, Latent Diffusion Models have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-quality synthetic data. Meanwhile, the integration of different modalities has gained interest, emphasizing the need of models capable of handle multimodal medical data. Existing approaches struggle to integrate complementary information and lack the ability to generate modalities simultaneously. To address this challenge, we present MedCoDi-M, a 6.77-billion-parameter model, designed for multimodal medical data generation, that, following Foundation Model paradigm, exploits contrastive learning and large quantity of data to build a shared latent space which capture the relationships between different data modalities. Further, we introduce the Multi-Prompt training technique, which significantly boosts MedCoDi-M's generation under different settings. We extensively validate MedCoDi-M: first we benchmark it against five competitors on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, a state-of-the-art dataset for Chest X-ray and radiological report generation. Secondly, we perform a Visual Turing Test with expert radiologists to assess the realism and clinical relevance of the generated data, ensuring alignment with real-world scenarios. Finally, we assess the utility of MedCoDi-M in addressing key challenges in the medical field, such as anonymization, data scarcity and imbalance learning. The results are promising, demonstrating the applicability of MedCoDi-M in medical contexts.

In this paper, we propose a novel associative memory-enhanced X-ray report generation model that effectively mimics the process of professional doctors writing medical reports. It considers both the mining of global and local visual information and associates historical report information to better complete the writing of the current report. Specifically, given an X-ray image, we first utilize a classification model along with its activation maps to accomplish the mining of visual regions highly associated with diseases and the learning of disease query tokens. Then, we employ a visual Hopfield network to establish memory associations for disease-related tokens, and a report Hopfield network to retrieve report memory information. This process facilitates the generation of high-quality reports based on a large language model and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including the IU X-ray, MIMIC-CXR, and Chexpert Plus.

The automated generation of radiography reports has thus the potential to improve and standardize patient care and significantly reduce clinicians workload. Through our work, we have designed and evaluated an end-to-end transformer-based method to generate accurate and factually complete radiology reports for X-ray images.

|**2024-12-31**|**CRRG-CLIP: Automatic Generation of Chest Radiology Reports and Classification of Chest Radiographs**|The complexity of stacked imaging and the massive number of radiographs make writing radiology reports complex and inefficient. Even highly experienced radiologists struggle to maintain accuracy and consistency in interpreting radiographs under prolonged high-intensity work. To address these issues, this work proposes the CRRG-CLIP Model (Chest Radiology Report Generation and Radiograph Classification Model), an end-to-end model for automated report generation and radiograph classification. The model consists of two modules: the radiology report generation module and the radiograph classification module. The generation module uses Faster R-CNN to identify anatomical regions in radiographs, a binary classifier to select key regions, and GPT-2 to generate semantically coherent reports. The classification module uses the unsupervised Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, addressing the challenges of high-cost labelled datasets and insufficient features. The results show that the generation module performs comparably to high-performance baseline models on BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and outperformed the GPT-4o model on BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4, and ROUGE-L metrics. The classification module significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art model in AUC and Accuracy. This demonstrates that the proposed model achieves high accuracy, readability, and fluency in report generation, while multimodal contrastive training with unlabelled radiograph-report pairs enhances classification performance.|Jianfei Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01989)|**[link](https://github.com/jianfeixu95/csc8639)**|
|**2025-01-27**|**MoColl: Agent-Based Specific and General Model Collaboration for Image Captioning**|Image captioning is a critical task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications across various domains. For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we call MoColl, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond its role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to enhance its domain-specific capabilities. Experimental results on radiology report generation validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of generated reports.|Pu Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01834)|null|
|**2024-12-24**|**Text-Driven Tumor Synthesis**|Tumor synthesis can generate examples that AI often misses or over-detects, improving AI performance by training on these challenging cases. However, existing synthesis methods, which are typically unconditional -- generating images from random variables -- or conditioned only by tumor shapes, lack controllability over specific tumor characteristics such as texture, heterogeneity, boundaries, and pathology type. As a result, the generated tumors may be overly similar or duplicates of existing training data, failing to effectively address AI's weaknesses. We propose a new text-driven tumor synthesis approach, termed TextoMorph, that provides textual control over tumor characteristics. This is particularly beneficial for examples that confuse the AI the most, such as early tumor detection (increasing Sensitivity by +8.5%), tumor segmentation for precise radiotherapy (increasing DSC by +6.3%), and classification between benign and malignant tumors (improving Sensitivity by +8.2%). By incorporating text mined from radiology reports into the synthesis process, we increase the variability and controllability of the synthetic tumors to target AI's failure cases more precisely. Moreover, TextoMorph uses contrastive learning across different texts and CT scans, significantly reducing dependence on scarce image-report pairs (only 141 pairs used in this study) by leveraging a large corpus of 34,035 radiology reports. Finally, we have developed rigorous tests to evaluate synthetic tumors, including Text-Driven Visual Turing Test and Radiomics Pattern Analysis, showing that our synthetic tumors is realistic and diverse in texture, heterogeneity, boundaries, and pathology.|Xinran Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18589)|null|

While Japan leads globally in CT scanner deployment and utilization, the lack of large-scale Japanese radiology datasets has hindered the development of specialized language models for medical imaging analysis. Objective: To develop a comprehensive Japanese CT report dataset through machine translation and establish a specialized language model for structured finding classification. Additionally, to create a rigorously validated evaluation dataset through expert radiologist review. Methods: We translated the CT-RATE dataset (24,283 CT reports from 21,304 patients) into Japanese using GPT-4o mini. The training dataset consisted of 22,778 machine-translated reports, while the validation dataset included 150 radiologist-revised reports. We developed CT-BERT-JPN based on "tohoku-nlp/bert-base-japanese-v3" architecture for extracting 18 structured findings from Japanese radiology reports. Results: Translation metrics showed strong performance with BLEU scores of 0.731 and 0.690, and ROUGE scores ranging from 0.770 to 0.876 for Findings and from 0.748 to 0.857 for Impression sections. CT-BERT-JPN demonstrated superior performance compared to GPT-4o in 11 out of 18 conditions, including lymphadenopathy (+14.2%), interlobular septal thickening (+10.9%), and atelectasis (+7.4%).

However, existing work often overlook the clinical pipeline involved in report writing, where physicians typically conduct an initial quick review followed by a detailed examination. Moreover, current alignment methods may lead to misaligned relationships. To address these issues, we propose DAMPER, a dual-stage framework for medical report generation that mimics the clinical pipeline of report writing in two stages. In the first stage, a MeSH-Guided Coarse-Grained Alignment (MCG) stage that aligns chest X-ray (CXR) image features with medical subject headings (MeSH) features to generate a rough keyphrase representation of the overall impression. In the second stage, a Hypergraph-Enhanced Fine-Grained Alignment (HFG) stage that constructs hypergraphs for image patches and report annotations, modeling high-order relationships within each modality and performing hypergraph matching to capture semantic correlations between image regions and textual phrases. Finally,the coarse-grained visual features, generated MeSH representations, and visual hypergraph features are fed into a report decoder to produce the final medical report. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DAMPER in generating comprehensive and accurate medical reports, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation metrics.|Xiaofei Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14535)|null|

|**2024-12-18**|**Read Like a Radiologist: Efficient Vision-Language Model for 3D Medical Imaging Interpretation**|Recent medical vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in 2D medical image interpretation. However extending them to 3D medical imaging has been challenging due to computational complexities and data scarcity. Although a few recent VLMs specified for 3D medical imaging have emerged, all are limited to learning volumetric representation of a 3D medical image as a set of sub-volumetric features. Such process introduces overly correlated representations along the z-axis that neglect slice-specific clinical details, particularly for 3D medical images where adjacent slices have low redundancy. To address this limitation, we introduce MS-VLM that mimic radiologists' workflow in 3D medical image interpretation. Specifically, radiologists analyze 3D medical images by examining individual slices sequentially and synthesizing information across slices and views. Likewise, MS-VLM leverages self-supervised 2D transformer encoders to learn a volumetric representation that capture inter-slice dependencies from a sequence of slice-specific features. Unbound by sub-volumetric patchification, MS-VLM is capable of obtaining useful volumetric representations from 3D medical images with any slice length and from multiple images acquired from different planes and phases. We evaluate MS-VLM on publicly available chest CT dataset CT-RATE and in-house rectal MRI dataset. In both scenarios, MS-VLM surpasses existing methods in radiology report generation, producing more coherent and clinically relevant reports. These findings highlight the potential of MS-VLM to advance 3D medical image interpretation and improve the robustness of medical VLMs.|Changsun Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13558)|null|

While artificial intelligence (AI) based automated radiology report generation shows promise for reporting workflow optimization, evidence of its real-world impact on clinical accuracy and efficiency remains limited. This study evaluated the effect of draft reports on radiology reporting workflows by conducting a three reader multi-case study comparing standard versus AI-assisted reporting workflows. In both workflows, radiologists reviewed the cases and modified either a standard template (standard workflow) or an AI-generated draft report (AI-assisted workflow) to create the final report. For controlled evaluation, we used GPT-4 to generate simulated AI drafts and deliberately introduced 1-3 errors in half the cases to mimic real AI system performance. The AI-assisted workflow significantly reduced average reporting time from 573 to 435 seconds (p=0.003), without a statistically significant difference in clinically significant errors between workflows. These findings suggest that AI-generated drafts can meaningfully accelerate radiology reporting while maintaining diagnostic accuracy, offering a practical solution to address mounting workload challenges in clinical practice.|Julián N.

|**2024-12-16**|**LLM-RG4: Flexible and Factual Radiology Report Generation across Diverse Input Contexts**|Drafting radiology reports is a complex task requiring flexibility, where radiologists tail content to available information and particular clinical demands. However, most current radiology report generation (RRG) models are constrained to a fixed task paradigm, such as predicting the full ``finding'' section from a single image, inherently involving a mismatch between inputs and outputs. The trained models lack the flexibility for diverse inputs and could generate harmful, input-agnostic hallucinations. To bridge the gap between current RRG models and the clinical demands in practice, we first develop a data generation pipeline to create a new MIMIC-RG4 dataset, which considers four common radiology report drafting scenarios and has perfectly corresponded input and output. Secondly, we propose a novel large language model (LLM) based RRG framework, namely LLM-RG4, which utilizes LLM's flexible instruction-following capabilities and extensive general knowledge. We further develop an adaptive token fusion module that offers flexibility to handle diverse scenarios with different input combinations, while minimizing the additional computational burden associated with increased input volumes. Besides, we propose a token-level loss weighting strategy to direct the model's attention towards positive and uncertain descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-RG4 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both clinical efficiency and natural language generation on the MIMIC-RG4 and MIMIC-CXR datasets. We quantitatively demonstrate that our model has minimal input-agnostic hallucinations, whereas current open-source models commonly suffer from this problem.|Zhuhao Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12001)|**[link](https://github.com/zh-wang-med/llm-rg4)**|
|**2024-12-15**|**HC-LLM: Historical-Constrained Large Language Models for Radiology Report Generation**|Radiology report generation (RRG) models typically focus on individual exams, often overlooking the integration of historical visual or textual data, which is crucial for patient follow-ups. Traditional methods usually struggle with long sequence dependencies when incorporating historical information, but large language models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, making them well-suited for analyzing longitudinal medical data. In light of this, we propose a novel Historical-Constrained Large Language Models (HC-LLM) framework for RRG, empowering LLMs with longitudinal report generation capabilities by constraining the consistency and differences between longitudinal images and their corresponding reports. Specifically, our approach extracts both time-shared and time-specific features from longitudinal chest X-rays and diagnostic reports to capture disease progression. Then, we ensure consistent representation by applying intra-modality similarity constraints and aligning various features across modalities with multimodal contrastive and structural constraints. These combined constraints effectively guide the LLMs in generating diagnostic reports that accurately reflect the progression of the disease, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Longitudinal-MIMIC dataset. Notably, our approach performs well even without historical data during testing and can be easily adapted to other multimodal large models, enhancing its versatility.|Tengfei Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11070)|**[link](https://github.com/tengfeiliu966/hc-llm)**|
|**2024-12-13**|**Radiology Report Generation via Multi-objective Preference Optimization**|Automatic Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is an important topic for alleviating the substantial workload of radiologists. Existing RRG approaches rely on supervised regression based on different architectures or additional knowledge injection,while the generated report may not align optimally with radiologists' preferences. Especially, since the preferences of radiologists are inherently heterogeneous and multidimensional, e.g., some may prioritize report fluency, while others emphasize clinical accuracy. To address this problem,we propose a new RRG method via Multi-objective Preference Optimization (MPO) to align the pre-trained RRG model with multiple human preferences, which can be formulated by multi-dimensional reward functions and optimized by multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use a preference vector to represent the weight of preferences and use it as a condition for the RRG model. Then, a linearly weighed reward is obtained via a dot product between the preference vector and multi-dimensional reward. Next,the RRG model is optimized to align with the preference vector by optimizing such a reward via RL. In the training stage,we randomly sample diverse preference vectors from the preference space and align the model by optimizing the weighted multi-objective rewards, which leads to an optimal policy on the entire preference space. When inference,our model can generate reports aligned with specific preferences without further fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the proposed method can generate reports that cater to different preferences in a single model and achieve state-of-the-art performance.|Ting Xiao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08901)|null|

RadCouncil comprises three specialized agents: 1) a "Retrieval" Agent that identifies and retrieves similar reports from a vector database, 2) a "Radiologist" Agent that generates impressions based on the finding section of the given report plus the exemplar reports retrieved by the Retrieval Agent, and 3) a "Reviewer" Agent that evaluates the generated impressions and provides feedback. The performance of RadCouncil was evaluated using both quantitative metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) and qualitative criteria assessed by GPT-4, using chest X-ray as a case study. Experiment results show improvements in RadCouncil over the single-agent approach across multiple dimensions, including diagnostic accuracy, stylistic concordance, and clarity.

|**2024-12-08**|**MG-3D: Multi-Grained Knowledge-Enhanced 3D Medical Vision-Language Pre-training**|3D medical image analysis is pivotal in numerous clinical applications. However, the scarcity of labeled data and limited generalization capabilities hinder the advancement of AI-empowered models. Radiology reports are easily accessible and can serve as weakly-supervised signals. However, large-scale vision-language pre-training (VLP) remains underexplored in 3D medical image analysis. Specifically, the insufficient investigation into multi-grained radiology semantics and their correlations across patients leads to underutilization of large-scale volume-report data.   Considering intra-patient cross-modal semantic consistency and inter-patient semantic correlations, we propose a multi-task VLP method, MG-3D, pre-trained on large-scale data (47.1K), addressing the challenges by the following two aspects: 1) Establishing the correspondence between volume semantics and multi-grained medical knowledge of each patient with cross-modal global alignment and complementary modality-guided local reconstruction, ensuring intra-patient features of different modalities cohesively represent the same semantic content; 2) Correlating inter-patient visual semantics based on fine-grained report correlations across patients, and keeping sensitivity to global individual differences via contrastive learning, enhancing the discriminative feature representation. Furthermore, we delve into the scaling law to explore potential performance improvements. Comprehensive evaluations across nine uni- and cross-modal clinical tasks are carried out to assess model efficacy. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets demonstrate the superior transferability, scalability, and generalization of MG-3D, showcasing its potential in advancing feature representation for 3D medical image analysis.

While recent advancements have improved the quality and coherence of generated reports, ensuring their factual correctness remains a critical challenge. Although generative medical Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have been proposed to address this issue, these models are prone to hallucinations and can produce inaccurate diagnostic information. To address these concerns, we introduce a novel Semantic Consistency-Based Uncertainty Quantification framework that provides both report-level and sentence-level uncertainties. Unlike existing approaches, our method does not require modifications to the underlying model or access to its inner state, such as output token logits, thus serving as a plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method in detecting hallucinations and enhancing the factual accuracy of automatically generated radiology reports. By abstaining from high-uncertainty reports, our approach improves factuality scores by $10$%, achieved by rejecting $20$% of reports using the Radialog model on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. Furthermore, sentence-level uncertainty flags the lowest-precision sentence in each report with an $82.9$ % success rate.|Chenyu Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04606)|null|

In this work, we apply these captioning techniques to generate clinician-like interpretations of ECG data. This study leverages existing ECG datasets accompanied by free-text reports authored by healthcare professionals (HCPs) as training data. These reports, while often inconsistent, provide a valuable foundation for automated learning. We introduce an encoder-decoder-based method that uses these reports to train models to generate detailed descriptions of ECG episodes. This represents a significant advancement in ECG analysis automation, with potential applications in zero-shot classification and automated clinical decision support.   The model is tested on various datasets, including both 1- and 12-lead ECGs. It significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art reference model by Qiu et al., achieving a METEOR score of 55.53% compared to 24.51% achieved by the reference model.

Subsequently, we propose a two-stage framework capable of pinpointing these errors and then making corrections, simulating an \textit{autocorrection} process. This method aims to address the shortcomings of existing automated medical reporting systems, like factual errors and incorrect conclusions, enhancing report reliability in vital healthcare applications. Importantly, our approach could serve as a guardrail, ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of automated report generation.

However, their practical utility has been limited due to the factual errors in their description of findings. In this paper, we propose a novel model for explainable fact-checking that identifies errors in findings and their locations indicated through the reports. Specifically, we analyze the types of errors made by automated reporting methods and derive a new synthetic dataset of images paired with real and fake descriptions of findings and their locations from a ground truth dataset. A new multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this datsaset. We evaluate the resulting fact-checking model and its utility in correcting reports generated by several SOTA automated reporting tools on a variety of benchmark datasets with results pointing to over 40\% improvement in report quality through such error detection and correction.|R.

In this paper, we develop a new method of report quality evaluation by first extracting fine-grained finding patterns capturing the location, laterality, and severity of a large number of clinical findings. We then performed phrasal grounding to localize their associated anatomical regions on chest radiograph images. The textual and visual measures are then combined to rate the quality of the generated reports. We present results that compare this evaluation metric with other textual metrics on a gold standard dataset derived from the MIMIC collection and show its robustness and sensitivity to factual errors.|Razi Mahmood et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01031)|null|
|**2024-11-28**|**Libra: Leveraging Temporal Images for Biomedical Radiology Analysis**|Radiology report generation (RRG) is a challenging task, as it requires a thorough understanding of medical images, integration of multiple temporal inputs, and accurate report generation. Effective interpretation of medical images, such as chest X-rays (CXRs), demands sophisticated visual-language reasoning to map visual findings to structured reports. Recent studies have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can acquire multimodal capabilities by aligning with pre-trained vision encoders. However, current approaches predominantly focus on single-image analysis or utilise rule-based symbolic processing to handle multiple images, thereby overlooking the essential temporal information derived from comparing current images with prior ones. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce Libra, a temporal-aware MLLM tailored for CXR report generation using temporal images. Libra integrates a radiology-specific image encoder with a MLLM and utilises a novel Temporal Alignment Connector to capture and synthesise temporal information of images across different time points with unprecedented precision. Extensive experiments show that Libra achieves new state-of-the-art performance among the same parameter scale MLLMs for RRG tasks on the MIMIC-CXR. Specifically, Libra improves the RadCliQ metric by 12.9% and makes substantial gains across all lexical metrics compared to previous models.|Xi Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19378)|**[link](https://github.com/X-iZhang/Libra)**|

We introduce FactCheXcker, a modular framework that de-hallucinates radiology report measurements by leveraging an improved query-code-update paradigm. Specifically, FactCheXcker employs specialized modules and the code generation capabilities of large language models to solve measurement queries generated based on the original report. After extracting measurable findings, the results are incorporated into an updated report. We evaluate FactCheXcker on endotracheal tube placement, which accounts for an average of 78% of report measurements, using the MIMIC-CXR dataset and 11 medical report-generation models. Our results show that FactCheXcker significantly reduces hallucinations, improves measurement precision, and maintains the quality of the original reports. Specifically, FactCheXcker improves the performance of all 11 models and achieves an average improvement of 94.0% in reducing measurement hallucinations measured by mean absolute error.|Alice Heiman et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18672)|null|
|**2024-11-27**|**Optimized Conformal Selection: Powerful Selective Inference After Conformity Score Optimization**|Model selection/optimization in conformal inference is challenging, since it may break the exchangeability between labeled and unlabeled data. We study this problem in the context of conformal selection, which uses conformal p-values to select ``interesting'' instances with large unobserved labels from a pool of unlabeled data, while controlling the FDR in finite sample. For validity, existing solutions require the model choice to be independent of the data used to construct the p-values and calibrate the selection set. However, when presented with many model choices and limited labeled data, it is desirable to (i) select the best model in a data-driven manner, and (ii) mitigate power loss due to sample splitting.   This paper presents OptCS, a general framework that allows valid statistical testing (selection) after flexible data-driven model optimization. We introduce general conditions under which OptCS constructs valid conformal p-values despite substantial data reuse and handles complex p-value dependencies to maintain finite-sample FDR control via a novel multiple testing procedure. We instantiate this general recipe to propose three FDR-controlling procedures, each optimizing the models differently: (i) selecting the most powerful one among multiple pre-trained candidate models, (ii) using all data for model fitting without sample splitting, and (iii) combining full-sample model fitting and selection. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods via simulation studies and real applications in drug discovery and alignment of large language models in radiology report generation.|Tian Bai et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17983)|null|
|**2024-11-26**|**HOPPR Medical-Grade Platform for Medical Imaging AI**|Technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of large vision language models (LVLMs) that are trained on millions of paired image and text samples. Subsequent research efforts have demonstrated great potential of LVLMs to achieve high performance in medical imaging use cases (e.g., radiology report generation), but there remain barriers that hinder the ability to deploy these solutions broadly. These include the cost of extensive computational requirements for developing large scale models, expertise in the development of sophisticated AI models, and the difficulty in accessing substantially large, high-quality datasets that adequately represent the population in which the LVLM solution is to be deployed. The HOPPR Medical-Grade Platform addresses these barriers by providing powerful computational infrastructure, a suite of foundation models on top of which developers can fine-tune for their specific use cases, and a robust quality management system that sets a standard for evaluating fine-tuned models for deployment in clinical settings. The HOPPR Platform has access to millions of imaging studies and text reports sourced from hundreds of imaging centers from diverse populations to pretrain foundation models and enable use case-specific cohorts for fine-tuning. All data are deidentified and securely stored for HIPAA compliance. Additionally, developers can securely host models on the HOPPR platform and access them via an API to make inferences using these models within established clinical workflows. With the Medical-Grade Platform, HOPPR's mission is to expedite the deployment of LVLM solutions for medical imaging and ultimately optimize radiologist's workflows and meet the growing demands of the field.|Kalina P.

|**2024-11-26**|**ER2Score: LLM-based Explainable and Customizable Metric for Assessing Radiology Reports with Reward-Control Loss**|Automated radiology report generation (R2Gen) has advanced significantly, introducing challenges in accurate evaluation due to its complexity. Traditional metrics often fall short by relying on rigid word-matching or focusing only on pathological entities, leading to inconsistencies with human assessments. To bridge this gap, we introduce ER2Score, an automatic evaluation metric designed specifically for R2Gen. Our metric utilizes a reward model, guided by our margin-based reward enforcement loss, along with a tailored training data design that enables customization of evaluation criteria to suit user-defined needs. It not only scores reports according to user-specified criteria but also provides detailed sub-scores, enhancing interpretability and allowing users to adjust the criteria between different aspects of reports. Leveraging GPT-4, we designed an easy-to-use data generation pipeline, enabling us to produce extensive training data based on two distinct scoring systems, each containing reports of varying quality along with corresponding scores. These GPT-generated reports are then paired as accepted and rejected samples through our pairing rule to train an LLM towards our fine-grained reward model, which assigns higher rewards to the report with high quality. Our reward-control loss enables this model to simultaneously output multiple individual rewards corresponding to the number of evaluation criteria, with their summation as our final ER2Score. Our experiments demonstrate ER2Score's heightened correlation with human judgments and superior performance in model selection compared to traditional metrics. Notably, our model provides both an overall score and individual scores for each evaluation item, enhancing interpretability. We also demonstrate its flexible training across various evaluation systems.|Yunyi Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17301)|null|
|**2024-11-25**|**LaB-RAG: Label Boosted Retrieval Augmented Generation for Radiology Report Generation**|In the current paradigm of image captioning, deep learning models are trained to generate text from image embeddings of latent features. We challenge the assumption that these latent features ought to be high-dimensional vectors which require model fine tuning to handle. Here we propose Label Boosted Retrieval Augmented Generation (LaB-RAG), a text-based approach to image captioning that leverages image descriptors in the form of categorical labels to boost standard retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with pretrained large language models (LLMs). We study our method in the context of radiology report generation (RRG), where the task is to generate a clinician's report detailing their observations from a set of radiological images, such as X-rays. We argue that simple linear classifiers over extracted image embeddings can effectively transform X-rays into text-space as radiology-specific labels. In combination with standard RAG, we show that these derived text labels can be used with general-domain LLMs to generate radiology reports. Without ever training our generative language model or image feature encoder models, and without ever directly "showing" the LLM an X-ray, we demonstrate that LaB-RAG achieves better results across natural language and radiology language metrics compared with other retrieval-based RRG methods, while attaining competitive results compared to other fine-tuned vision-language RRG models. We further present results of our experiments with various components of LaB-RAG to better understand our method. Finally, we critique the use of a popular RRG metric, arguing it is possible to artificially inflate its results without true data-leakage.|Steven Song et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16523)|null|
|**2024-11-23**|**Improving Factuality of 3D Brain MRI Report Generation with Paired Image-domain Retrieval and Text-domain Augmentation**|Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) requires time-critical management, with hours of delayed intervention leading to an irreversible disability of the patient. Since diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) using the magnetic resonance image (MRI) plays a crucial role in the detection of AIS, automated prediction of AIS from DWI has been a research topic of clinical importance. While text radiology reports contain the most relevant clinical information from the image findings, the difficulty of mapping across different modalities has limited the factuality of conventional direct DWI-to-report generation methods. Here, we propose paired image-domain retrieval and text-domain augmentation (PIRTA), a cross-modal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for providing clinician-interpretative AIS radiology reports with improved factuality. PIRTA mitigates the need for learning cross-modal mapping, which poses difficulty in image-to-text generation, by casting the cross-modal mapping problem as an in-domain retrieval of similar DWI images that have paired ground-truth text radiology reports. By exploiting the retrieved radiology reports to augment the report generation process of the query image, we show by experiments with extensive in-house and public datasets that PIRTA can accurately retrieve relevant reports from 3D DWI images. This approach enables the generation of radiology reports with significantly higher accuracy compared to direct image-to-text generation using state-of-the-art multimodal language models.|Junhyeok Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15490)|null|

|**2024-11-19**|**A Survey of Medical Vision-and-Language Applications and Their Techniques**|Medical vision-and-language models (MVLMs) have attracted substantial interest due to their capability to offer a natural language interface for interpreting complex medical data. Their applications are versatile and have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and decision-making for individual patients while also contributing to enhanced public health monitoring, disease surveillance, and policy-making through more efficient analysis of large data sets. MVLMS integrate natural language processing with medical images to enable a more comprehensive and contextual understanding of medical images alongside their corresponding textual information. Unlike general vision-and-language models trained on diverse, non-specialized datasets, MVLMs are purpose-built for the medical domain, automatically extracting and interpreting critical information from medical images and textual reports to support clinical decision-making. Popular clinical applications of MVLMs include automated medical report generation, medical visual question answering, medical multimodal segmentation, diagnosis and prognosis and medical image-text retrieval. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of MVLMs and the various medical tasks to which they have been applied. We conduct a detailed analysis of various vision-and-language model architectures, focusing on their distinct strategies for cross-modal integration/exploitation of medical visual and textual features.

This paper investigates whether incorporating pixel-level information through segmentation masks can improve fine-grained image interpretation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for radiology report generation. We introduce MAIRA-Seg, a segmentation-aware MLLM framework designed to utilize semantic segmentation masks alongside CXRs for generating radiology reports. We train expert segmentation models to obtain mask pseudolabels for radiology-specific structures in CXRs. Subsequently, building on the architectures of MAIRA, a CXR-specialised model for report generation, we integrate a trainable segmentation tokens extractor that leverages these mask pseudolabels, and employ mask-aware prompting to generate draft radiology reports. Our experiments on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR dataset show that MAIRA-Seg outperforms non-segmentation baselines. We also investigate set-of-marks prompting with MAIRA and find that MAIRA-Seg consistently demonstrates comparable or superior performance. The results confirm that using segmentation masks enhances the nuanced reasoning of MLLMs, potentially contributing to better clinical outcomes.|Harshita Sharma et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11362)|null|
|**2024-11-16**|**Anatomy-Guided Radiology Report Generation with Pathology-Aware Regional Prompts**|Radiology reporting generative AI holds significant potential to alleviate clinical workloads and streamline medical care. However, achieving high clinical accuracy is challenging, as radiological images often feature subtle lesions and intricate structures. Existing systems often fall short, largely due to their reliance on fixed size, patch-level image features and insufficient incorporation of pathological information. This can result in the neglect of such subtle patterns and inconsistent descriptions of crucial pathologies. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach that leverages pathology-aware regional prompts to explicitly integrate anatomical and pathological information of various scales, significantly enhancing the precision and clinical relevance of generated reports. We develop an anatomical region detector that extracts features from distinct anatomical areas, coupled with a novel multi-label lesion detector that identifies global pathologies. Our approach emulates the diagnostic process of radiologists, producing clinically accurate reports with comprehensive diagnostic capabilities.

While automatic report generation offers a solution, existing methods often rely on single-view radiographs, limiting diagnostic accuracy. To address this problem, we propose MCL, a Multi-view enhanced Contrastive Learning method for chest X-ray report generation. Specifically, we first introduce multi-view enhanced contrastive learning for visual representation by maximizing agreements between multi-view radiographs and their corresponding report. Subsequently, to fully exploit patient-specific indications (e.g., patient's symptoms) for report generation, we add a transitional ``bridge" for missing indications to reduce embedding space discrepancies caused by their presence or absence. Additionally, we construct Multi-view CXR and Two-view CXR datasets from public sources to support research on multi-view report generation. Our proposed MCL surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, achieving a 5.0% F1 RadGraph improvement on MIMIC-CXR, a 7.3% BLEU-1 improvement on MIMIC-ABN, a 3.1% BLEU-4 improvement on Multi-view CXR, and an 8.2% F1 CheXbert improvement on Two-view CXR.|Kang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10224)|**[link](https://github.com/mk-runner/mcl)**|
|**2024-11-15**|**JRadiEvo: A Japanese Radiology Report Generation Model Enhanced by Evolutionary Optimization of Model Merging**|With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), foundational models (FMs) have seen significant advancements. Healthcare is one of the most crucial application areas for these FMs, given the significant time and effort required for physicians to analyze large volumes of patient data. Recent efforts have focused on adapting multimodal FMs to the medical domain through techniques like instruction-tuning, leading to the development of medical foundation models (MFMs). However, these approaches typically require large amounts of training data to effectively adapt models to the medical field. Moreover, most existing models are trained on English datasets, limiting their practicality in non-English-speaking regions where healthcare professionals and patients are not always fluent in English. The need for translation introduces additional costs and inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{J}apanese \textbf{Radi}ology report generation model enhanced by \textbf{Evo}lutionary optimization of model merging (JRadiEvo). This is the first attempt to extend a non-medical vision-language foundation model to the medical domain through evolutionary optimization of model merging. We successfully created a model that generates accurate Japanese reports from X-ray images using only 50 translated samples from publicly available data. This model, developed with highly efficient use of limited data, outperformed leading models from recent research trained on much larger datasets. Additionally, with only 8 billion parameters, this relatively compact foundation model can be deployed locally within hospitals, making it a practical solution for environments where APIs and other external services cannot be used due to strict privacy and security requirements.|Kaito Baba et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09933)|null|
|**2024-11-07**|**PadChest-GR: A Bilingual Chest X-ray Dataset for Grounded Radiology Report Generation**|Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to create free-text radiology reports from clinical imaging. Grounded radiology report generation (GRRG) extends RRG by including the localisation of individual findings on the image. Currently, there are no manually annotated chest X-ray (CXR) datasets to train GRRG models. In this work, we present a dataset called PadChest-GR (Grounded-Reporting) derived from PadChest aimed at training GRRG models for CXR images. We curate a public bi-lingual dataset of 4,555 CXR studies with grounded reports (3,099 abnormal and 1,456 normal), each containing complete lists of sentences describing individual present (positive) and absent (negative) findings in English and Spanish. In total, PadChest-GR contains 7,037 positive and 3,422 negative finding sentences. Every positive finding sentence is associated with up to two independent sets of bounding boxes labelled by different readers and has categorical labels for finding type, locations, and progression. To the best of our knowledge, PadChest-GR is the first manually curated dataset designed to train GRRG models for understanding and interpreting radiological images and generated text. By including detailed localization and comprehensive annotations of all clinically relevant findings, it provides a valuable resource for developing and evaluating GRRG models from CXR images.

|**2024-11-06**|**Improving Radiology Report Conciseness and Structure via Local Large Language Models**|In this study, we aim to enhance radiology reporting by improving both the conciseness and structured organization of findings (also referred to as templating), specifically by organizing information according to anatomical regions. This structured approach allows physicians to locate relevant information quickly, increasing the report's utility. We utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Mixtral, Mistral, and Llama to generate concise, well-structured reports. Among these, we primarily focus on the Mixtral model due to its superior adherence to specific formatting requirements compared to other models. To maintain data security and privacy, we run these LLMs locally behind our institution's firewall. We leverage the LangChain framework and apply five distinct prompting strategies to enforce a consistent structure in radiology reports, aiming to eliminate extraneous language and achieve a high level of conciseness. We also introduce a novel metric, the Conciseness Percentage (CP) score, to evaluate report brevity. Our dataset comprises 814 radiology reports authored by seven board-certified body radiologists at our cancer center. In evaluating the different prompting methods, we discovered that the most effective approach for generating concise, well-structured reports involves first instructing the LLM to condense the report, followed by a prompt to structure the content according to specific guidelines. We assessed all prompting strategies based on their ability to handle formatting issues, reduce report length, and adhere to formatting instructions. Our findings demonstrate that open-source, locally deployed LLMs can significantly improve radiology report conciseness and structure while conforming to specified formatting standards.|Iryna Hartsock et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05042)|**[link](https://github.com/lab-rasool/radiology-reporting-with-llms)**|

Taking inspiration from image captioning, the task of radiology report generation aims at automatically generating radiology reports by having a comprehensive understanding of medical images. However, automatically generating radiology reports from medical images is a challenging task due to the complexity, diversity, and nature of medical images. In this paper, we outline the design of a robust radiology report generation system by integrating different modules and highlighting best practices drawing upon lessons from our past work and also from relevant studies in the literature. We also discuss the impact of integrating different components to form a single integrated system. We believe that these best practices, when implemented, could improve automatic radiology report generation, augment radiologists in decision making, and expedite diagnostic workflow, in turn improve healthcare and save human lives.|Sonit Singh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01153)|null|
|**2024-11-01**|**Tumor Location-weighted MRI-Report Contrastive Learning: A Framework for Improving the Explainability of Pediatric Brain Tumor Diagnosis**|Despite the promising performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in brain tumor diagnosis from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), their integration into the clinical workflow has been limited. That is mainly due to the fact that the features contributing to a model's prediction are unclear to radiologists and hence, clinically irrelevant, i.e., lack of explainability. As the invaluable sources of radiologists' knowledge and expertise, radiology reports can be integrated with MRI in a contrastive learning (CL) framework, enabling learning from image-report associations, to improve CNN explainability. In this work, we train a multimodal CL architecture on 3D brain MRI scans and radiology reports to learn informative MRI representations. Furthermore, we integrate tumor location, salient to several brain tumor analysis tasks, into this framework to improve its generalizability. We then apply the learnt image representations to improve explainability and performance of genetic marker classification of pediatric Low-grade Glioma, the most prevalent brain tumor in children, as a downstream task. Our results indicate a Dice score of 31.1% between the model's attention maps and manual tumor segmentation (as an explainability measure) with test classification performance of 87.7%, significantly outperforming the baselines. These enhancements can build trust in our model among radiologists, facilitating its integration into clinical practices for more efficient tumor diagnosis.|Sara Ketabi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00609)|null|
|**2024-11-16**|**RadFlag: A Black-Box Hallucination Detection Method for Medical Vision Language Models**|Generating accurate radiology reports from medical images is a clinically important but challenging task. While current Vision Language Models (VLMs) show promise, they are prone to generating hallucinations, potentially compromising patient care. We introduce RadFlag, a black-box method to enhance the accuracy of radiology report generation. Our method uses a sampling-based flagging technique to find hallucinatory generations that should be removed. We first sample multiple reports at varying temperatures and then use a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify claims that are not consistently supported across samples, indicating that the model has low confidence in those claims. Using a calibrated threshold, we flag a fraction of these claims as likely hallucinations, which should undergo extra review or be automatically rejected. Our method achieves high precision when identifying both individual hallucinatory sentences and reports that contain hallucinations. As an easy-to-use, black-box system that only requires access to a model's temperature parameter, RadFlag is compatible with a wide range of radiology report generation models and has the potential to broadly improve the quality of automated radiology reporting.|Serena Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00299)|null|

Advances in diagnosis, risk stratification, and prevention can improve outcomes. There are few large publicly available datasets that contain PE labels for research. Using the MIMIC-IV database, we extracted all available radiology reports of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) scans and two physicians manually labeled the results as PE positive (acute PE) or PE negative. We then applied a previously finetuned Bio_ClinicalBERT transformer language model, VTE-BERT, to extract labels automatically. We verified VTE-BERT's reliability by measuring its performance against manual adjudication. We also compared the performance of VTE-BERT to diagnosis codes. We found that VTE-BERT has a sensitivity of 92.4% and positive predictive value (PPV) of 87.8% on all 19,942 patients with CTPA radiology reports from the emergency room and/or hospital admission. In contrast, diagnosis codes have a sensitivity of 95.4% and PPV of 83.8% on the subset of 11,990 hospitalized patients with discharge diagnosis codes. We successfully add nearly 20,000 labels to CTPAs in a publicly available dataset and demonstrate the external validity of a semi-supervised language model in accelerating hematologic research.|B. D.

|**2024-10-31**|**The Potential of LLMs in Medical Education: Generating Questions and Answers for Qualification Exams**|Recent research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on their adaptation and application in specialized domains. The application of LLMs in the medical field is mainly concentrated on tasks such as the automation of medical report generation, summarization, diagnostic reasoning, and question-and-answer interactions between doctors and patients. The challenge of becoming a good teacher is more formidable than that of becoming a good student, and this study pioneers the application of LLMs in the field of medical education. In this work, we investigate the extent to which LLMs can generate medical qualification exam questions and corresponding answers based on few-shot prompts. Utilizing a real-world Chinese dataset of elderly chronic diseases, we tasked the LLMs with generating open-ended questions and answers based on a subset of sampled admission reports across eight widely used LLMs, including ERNIE 4, ChatGLM 4, Doubao, Hunyuan, Spark 4, Qwen, Llama 3, and Mistral. Furthermore, we engaged medical experts to manually evaluate these open-ended questions and answers across multiple dimensions. The study found that LLMs, after using few-shot prompts, can effectively mimic real-world medical qualification exam questions, whereas there is room for improvement in the correctness, evidence-based statements, and professionalism of the generated answers. Moreover, LLMs also demonstrate a decent level of ability to correct and rectify reference answers. Given the immense potential of artificial intelligence in the medical field, the task of generating questions and answers for medical qualification exams aimed at medical students, interns and residents can be a significant focus of future research.|Yunqi Zhu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23769)|null|

The key idea of our metric is to measure the similarity between radiology reports while considering the corresponding image. We demonstrate the benefit of our metric through evaluation on a dataset where radiologists marked errors in pairs of reports, showing notable alignment with radiologists' judgments. In addition, we provide a new dataset for evaluating metrics. This dataset includes well-designed perturbations that distinguish between significant modifications (e.g., removal of a diagnosis) and insignificant ones.

|**2024-10-17**|**Can Medical Vision-Language Pre-training Succeed with Purely Synthetic Data?**|Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (MedVLP) has made significant progress in enabling zero-shot tasks for medical image understanding. However, training MedVLP models typically requires large-scale datasets with paired, high-quality image-text data, which are scarce in the medical domain. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models have made it possible to generate large-scale synthetic image-text pairs. This raises the question: "Can MedVLP succeed using purely synthetic data?" To address this, we use off-the-shelf generative models to create synthetic radiology reports and paired Chest X-ray (CXR) images, and propose an automated pipeline to build a diverse, high-quality synthetic dataset, enabling a rigorous study that isolates model and training settings, focusing entirely from the data perspective. Our results show that MedVLP models trained exclusively on synthetic data outperform those trained on real data by 3.8% in averaged AUC on zero-shot classification. Moreover, using a combination of synthetic and real data leads to a further improvement of 9.07%. Additionally, MedVLP models trained on synthetic or mixed data consistently outperform those trained on real data in zero-shot grounding, as well as in fine-tuned classification and segmentation tasks. Our analysis suggests MedVLP trained on well-designed synthetic data can outperform models trained on real datasets, which may be limited by low-quality samples and long-tailed distributions.|Che Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13523)|null|

Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated superior diagnostic performance in BC classification compared to human expert readers. However, the predominant use of unimodal (digital mammography) features may limit the current performance of diagnostic models. To address this, we collected a novel multimodal dataset comprising both imaging and textual data. This study proposes a multimodal DL architecture for BC classification, utilising images (mammograms; four views) and textual data (radiological reports) from our new in-house dataset. Various augmentation techniques were applied to enhance the training data size for both imaging and textual data. We explored the performance of eleven SOTA DL architectures (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet34, ResNet50, MobileNet-v3, EffNet-b0, EffNet-b1, EffNet-b2, EffNet-b3, EffNet-b7, and Vision Transformer (ViT)) as imaging feature extractors. For textual feature extraction, we utilised either artificial neural networks (ANNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The combined imaging and textual features were then inputted into an ANN classifier for BC classification, using the late fusion technique. We evaluated different feature extractor and classifier arrangements. The VGG19 and ANN combinations achieved the highest accuracy of 0.951. For precision, the VGG19 and ANN combination again surpassed other CNN and LSTM, ANN based architectures by achieving a score of 0.95. The best sensitivity score of 0.903 was achieved by the VGG16+LSTM. The highest F1 score of 0.931 was achieved by VGG19+LSTM.

Similarly, methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which leverage vectorized databases, have further improved model performance by grounding outputs in external information. While these approaches have demonstrated notable success, they often require extensive training or labeled data, which can limit their adaptability in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-based Parameter Ensemble (RPE), a new method that creates a vectorized database of LoRAs, enabling efficient retrieval and application of model adaptations to new tasks. RPE minimizes the need for extensive training and eliminates the requirement for labeled data, making it particularly effective for zero-shot learning. Additionally, RPE is well-suited for privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare, as it modifies model parameters without accessing raw data. When applied to tasks such as medical report generation and image segmentation, RPE not only proved effective but also surpassed supervised fine-tuning methods in certain cases, highlighting its potential to enhance both computational efficiency and privacy in deep learning applications.|Pengfei Jin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09908)|null|

Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) suffer from hallucinations, lack interpretability, and require expensive fine-tuning. We introduce SAE-Rad, which uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose latent representations from a pre-trained vision transformer into human-interpretable features. Our hybrid architecture combines state-of-the-art SAE advancements, achieving accurate latent reconstructions while maintaining sparsity. Using an off-the-shelf language model, we distil ground-truth reports into radiological descriptions for each SAE feature, which we then compile into a full report for each image, eliminating the need for fine-tuning large models for this task. To the best of our knowledge, SAE-Rad represents the first instance of using mechanistic interpretability techniques explicitly for a downstream multi-modal reasoning task. On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, SAE-Rad achieves competitive radiology-specific metrics compared to state-of-the-art models while using significantly fewer computational resources for training. Qualitative analysis reveals that SAE-Rad learns meaningful visual concepts and generates reports aligning closely with expert interpretations.

Despite significant progress, we believe that the task has reached a bottleneck due to the limited benchmark datasets and the existing large models' insufficient capability enhancements in this specialized domain. Specifically, the recently released CheXpert Plus dataset lacks comparative evaluation algorithms and their results, providing only the dataset itself. This situation makes the training, evaluation, and comparison of subsequent algorithms challenging. Thus, we conduct a comprehensive benchmarking of existing mainstream X-ray report generation models and large language models (LLMs), on the CheXpert Plus dataset. We believe that the proposed benchmark can provide a solid comparative basis for subsequent algorithms and serve as a guide for researchers to quickly grasp the state-of-the-art models in this field. More importantly, we propose a large model for the X-ray image report generation using a multi-stage pre-training strategy, including self-supervised autoregressive generation and Xray-report contrastive learning, and supervised fine-tuning. Extensive experimental results indicate that the autoregressive pre-training based on Mamba effectively encodes X-ray images, and the image-text contrastive pre-training further aligns the feature spaces, achieving better experimental results.

Numerous efforts employ generative models to generate high-fidelity, unlabeled 3D volumes across diverse modalities and anatomical regions. However, the intricate and indistinguishable anatomical structures within the abdomen pose a unique challenge to abdominal CT volume generation compared to other anatomical regions. To address the overlooked challenge, we introduce the Locality-Aware Diffusion (Lad), a novel method tailored for exquisite 3D abdominal CT volume generation. We design a locality loss to refine crucial anatomical regions and devise a condition extractor to integrate abdominal priori into generation, thereby enabling the generation of large quantities of high-quality abdominal CT volumes essential for SSL tasks without the need for additional data such as labels or radiology reports. Volumes generated through our method demonstrate remarkable fidelity in reproducing abdominal structures, achieving a decrease in FID score from 0.0034 to 0.0002 on AbdomenCT-1K dataset, closely mirroring authentic data and surpassing current methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in self-supervised organ segmentation tasks, resulting in an improvement in mean Dice scores on two abdominal datasets effectively.

We evaluated a set of NLP models including BERT-like transformers, few-shot learning with sentence transformers (SetFit), and prompted large language models (LLM), using three datasets of radiology reports on magnetic resonance images of epilepsy patients in Danish, a low-resource language. Our results indicate that BERT-like models pretrained in the target domain of radiology reports currently offer the optimal performances for this scenario. Notably, the SetFit and LLM models underperformed compared to BERT-like models, with LLM performing the worst. Importantly, none of the models investigated was sufficiently accurate to allow for text classification without any supervision. However, they show potential for data filtering, which could reduce the amount of manual labeling required.|Vincent Beliveau et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20147)|**[link](https://github.com/vbeliveau/radiology-text-classification)**|

However, most models in medical field are unimodal single tasks and lack good generalizability and explainability. In this study, we introduce MedViLaM, a unified vision-language model towards a generalist model for medical data that can flexibly encode and interpret various forms of medical data, including clinical language and imaging, all using the same set of model weights. To facilitate the creation of such multi-task model, we have curated MultiMedBench, a comprehensive pretaining dataset and benchmark consisting of several distinct tasks, i.e., continuous question-answering, multi-label disease classification, disease localization, generation and summarization of radiology reports. MedViLaM demonstrates strong performance across all MultiMedBench tasks, frequently outpacing other generalist models by a significant margin. Additionally, we present instances of zero-shot generalization to new medical concepts and tasks, effective transfer learning across different tasks, and the emergence of zero-shot medical reasoning.|Lijian Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19684)|**[link](https://github.com/MedHK23/MedViLaM)**|

The demand for automated report generation systems has become increasingly urgent. While prior research has mainly focused on using machine learning and multimodal language models for 2D medical images, the generation of reports for 3D medical images has been less explored due to data scarcity and computational complexities. This paper introduces 3D-CT-GPT, a Visual Question Answering (VQA)-based medical visual language model specifically designed for generating radiology reports from 3D CT scans, particularly chest CTs. Extensive experiments on both public and private datasets demonstrate that 3D-CT-GPT significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of report accuracy and quality. Although current methods are few, including the partially open-source CT2Rep and the open-source M3D, we ensured fair comparison through appropriate data conversion and evaluation methodologies. Experimental results indicate that 3D-CT-GPT enhances diagnostic accuracy and report coherence, establishing itself as a robust solution for clinical radiology report generation. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset and further optimizing the model to enhance its performance and applicability.|Hao Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19330)|null|

Current LLMs in creating structured reports face the challenges of formatting errors, content hallucinations, and privacy leakage concerns when uploaded to external servers. We aim to develop an enhanced open-source LLM for creating structured and standardized LCS reports from free-text descriptions. After institutional IRB approvals, 5,442 de-identified LCS reports from two institutions were retrospectively analyzed. 500 reports were randomly selected from the two institutions evenly and then manually labeled for evaluation. Two radiologists from the two institutions developed a standardized template including 29 features for lung nodule reporting. We proposed template-constrained decoding to enhance state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, including LLAMA, Qwen, and Mistral. The LLM performance was extensively evaluated in terms of F1 score, confidence interval, McNemar test, and z-test. Based on the structured reports created from the large-scale dataset, a nodule-level retrieval system was prototyped and an automatic statistical analysis was performed. Our software, vLLM-structure, is publicly available for local deployment with enhanced LLMs. Our template-constrained decoding approach consistently enhanced the LLM performance on multi-institutional datasets, with neither formatting errors nor content hallucinations. Our method improved the best open-source LLAMA-3.1 405B by up to 10.42%, and outperformed GPT-4o by 17.19%.

For instance, state-of-the-art systems could automate the generation of sections in clinical reports to alleviate physician workload and streamline hospital documentation. To explore these applications, we present a shared task consisting of two subtasks: (1) Radiology Report Generation (RRG24) and (2) Discharge Summary Generation ("Discharge Me!"). RRG24 involves generating the 'Findings' and 'Impression' sections of radiology reports given chest X-rays. "Discharge Me!" involves generating the 'Brief Hospital Course' and 'Discharge Instructions' sections of discharge summaries for patients admitted through the emergency department. "Discharge Me!" submissions were subsequently reviewed by a team of clinicians. Both tasks emphasize the goal of reducing clinician burnout and repetitive workloads by generating documentation.

|**2024-09-25**|**Enhancing disease detection in radiology reports through fine-tuning lightweight LLM on weak labels**|Despite significant progress in applying large language models (LLMs) to the medical domain, several limitations still prevent them from practical applications. Among these are the constraints on model size and the lack of cohort-specific labeled datasets. In this work, we investigated the potential of improving a lightweight LLM, such as Llama 3.1-8B, through fine-tuning with datasets using synthetic labels. Two tasks are jointly trained by combining their respective instruction datasets. When the quality of the task-specific synthetic labels is relatively high (e.g., generated by GPT4- o), Llama 3.1-8B achieves satisfactory performance on the open-ended disease detection task, with a micro F1 score of 0.91. Conversely, when the quality of the task-relevant synthetic labels is relatively low (e.g., from the MIMIC-CXR dataset), fine-tuned Llama 3.1-8B is able to surpass its noisy teacher labels (micro F1 score of 0.67 v.s. 0.63) when calibrated against curated labels, indicating the strong inherent underlying capability of the model.

HeadCT-ONE enhances current information extraction derived metrics (such as RadGraph F1) by implementing entity normalization through domain-specific ontologies, addressing radiological language variability. HeadCT-ONE compares normalized entities and relations, allowing for controllable weighting of different entity types or specific entities. Through experiments on head CT reports from three health systems, we show that HeadCT-ONE's normalization and weighting approach improves the capture of semantically equivalent reports, better distinguishes between normal and abnormal reports, and aligns with radiologists' assessment of clinically significant errors, while offering flexibility to prioritize specific aspects of report content.

Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded.

To address this, we introduce ReXErr, a methodology that leverages Large Language Models to generate representative errors within chest X-ray reports. Working with board-certified radiologists, we developed error categories that capture common mistakes in both human and AI-generated reports. Our approach uses a novel sampling scheme to inject diverse errors while maintaining clinical plausibility. ReXErr demonstrates consistency across error categories and produces errors that closely mimic those found in real-world scenarios.

Methods and Materials: The study utilized two datasets: 7,294 radiology reports annotated for Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS) scores and 2,154 pathology reports annotated for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. An automated pipeline was developed to benchmark the performance of various LMs and RAG configurations. The impact of model size, quantization, prompting strategies, output formatting, and inference parameters was systematically evaluated. Results: The best performing models achieved over 98% accuracy in extracting BT-RADS scores from radiology reports and over 90% for IDH mutation status extraction from pathology reports. The top model being medical fine-tuned llama3. Larger, newer, and domain fine-tuned models consistently outperformed older and smaller models. Model quantization had minimal impact on performance. Few-shot prompting significantly improved accuracy. RAG improved performance for complex pathology reports but not for shorter radiology reports. Conclusions: Open LMs demonstrate significant potential for automated extraction of structured clinical data from unstructured clinical reports with local privacy-preserving application. Careful model selection, prompt engineering, and semi-automated optimization using annotated data are critical for optimal performance.

|**2024-09-09**|**KARGEN: Knowledge-enhanced Automated Radiology Report Generation Using Large Language Models**|Harnessing the robust capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for narrative generation, logical reasoning, and common-sense knowledge integration, this study delves into utilizing LLMs to enhance automated radiology report generation (R2Gen). Despite the wealth of knowledge within LLMs, efficiently triggering relevant knowledge within these large models for specific tasks like R2Gen poses a critical research challenge. This paper presents KARGEN, a Knowledge-enhanced Automated radiology Report GENeration framework based on LLMs. Utilizing a frozen LLM to generate reports, the framework integrates a knowledge graph to unlock chest disease-related knowledge within the LLM to enhance the clinical utility of generated reports. This is achieved by leveraging the knowledge graph to distill disease-related features in a designed way. Since a radiology report encompasses both normal and disease-related findings, the extracted graph-enhanced disease-related features are integrated with regional image features, attending to both aspects. We explore two fusion methods to automatically prioritize and select the most relevant features. The fused features are employed by LLM to generate reports that are more sensitive to diseases and of improved quality. Our approach demonstrates promising results on the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray datasets.|Yingshu Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05370)|null|
|**2024-09-06**|**FODA-PG for Enhanced Medical Imaging Narrative Generation: Adaptive Differentiation of Normal and Abnormal Attributes**|Automatic Medical Imaging Narrative generation aims to alleviate the workload of radiologists by producing accurate clinical descriptions directly from radiological images. However, the subtle visual nuances and domain-specific terminology in medical images pose significant challenges compared to generic image captioning tasks. Existing approaches often neglect the vital distinction between normal and abnormal findings, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose FODA-PG, a novel Fine-grained Organ-Disease Adaptive Partitioning Graph framework that addresses these limitations through domain-adaptive learning. FODA-PG constructs a granular graphical representation of radiological findings by separating disease-related attributes into distinct "disease-specific" and "disease-free" categories based on their clinical significance and location. This adaptive partitioning enables our model to capture the nuanced differences between normal and pathological states, mitigating the impact of data biases. By integrating this fine-grained semantic knowledge into a powerful transformer-based architecture and providing rigorous mathematical justifications for its effectiveness, FODA-PG generates precise and clinically coherent reports with enhanced generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on the IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation in medical report generation.|Kai Shu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03947)|null|
|**2024-09-04**|**A Medical Multimodal Large Language Model for Pediatric Pneumonia**|Pediatric pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children under five years worldwide, imposing a substantial burden on affected families. Currently, there are three significant hurdles in diagnosing and treating pediatric pneumonia. Firstly, pediatric pneumonia shares similar symptoms with other respiratory diseases, making rapid and accurate differential diagnosis challenging. Secondly, primary hospitals often lack sufficient medical resources and experienced doctors. Lastly, providing personalized diagnostic reports and treatment recommendations is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To tackle these challenges, we proposed a Medical Multimodal Large Language Model for Pediatric Pneumonia (P2Med-MLLM). It was capable of handling diverse clinical tasks, such as generating free-text radiology reports and medical records within a unified framework. Specifically, P2Med-MLLM can process both pure text and image-text data, trained on an extensive and large-scale dataset (P2Med-MD), including real clinical information from 163,999 outpatient and 8,684 inpatient cases. This dataset comprised 2D chest X-ray images, 3D chest CT images, corresponding radiology reports, and outpatient and inpatient records. We designed a three-stage training strategy to enable P2Med-MLLM to comprehend medical knowledge and follow instructions for various clinical tasks. To rigorously evaluate P2Med-MLLM's performance, we developed P2Med-MBench, a benchmark consisting of 642 meticulously verified samples by pediatric pulmonology specialists, covering six clinical decision-support tasks and a balanced variety of diseases. The automated scoring results demonstrated the superiority of P2Med-MLLM. This work plays a crucial role in assisting primary care doctors with prompt disease diagnosis and treatment planning, reducing severe symptom mortality rates, and optimizing the allocation of medical resources.|Weiwei Tian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02608)|null|
|**2024-08-30**|**Medical Report Generation Is A Multi-label Classification Problem**|Medical report generation is a critical task in healthcare that involves the automatic creation of detailed and accurate descriptions from medical images. Traditionally, this task has been approached as a sequence generation problem, relying on vision-and-language techniques to generate coherent and contextually relevant reports. However, in this paper, we propose a novel perspective: rethinking medical report generation as a multi-label classification problem. By framing the task this way, we leverage the radiology nodes from the commonly used knowledge graph, which can be better captured through classification techniques. To verify our argument, we introduce a novel report generation framework based on BLIP integrated with classified key nodes, which allows for effective report generation with accurate classification of multiple key aspects within the medical images. This approach not only simplifies the report generation process but also significantly enhances performance metrics. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that leveraging key nodes can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, surpassing existing approaches across two benchmark datasets. The results underscore the potential of re-envisioning traditional tasks with innovative methodologies, paving the way for more efficient and accurate medical report generation.|Yijian Fan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00250)|null|

In chest X-ray (CXR) analysis, previous studies have employed LLMs, but with limitations: either underutilizing the multi-tasking capabilities of LLMs or lacking clinical accuracy. This paper presents M4CXR, a multi-modal LLM designed to enhance CXR interpretation. The model is trained on a visual instruction-following dataset that integrates various task-specific datasets in a conversational format. As a result, the model supports multiple tasks such as medical report generation (MRG), visual grounding, and visual question answering (VQA). M4CXR achieves state-of-the-art clinical accuracy in MRG by employing a chain-of-thought prompting strategy, in which it identifies findings in CXR images and subsequently generates corresponding reports. The model is adaptable to various MRG scenarios depending on the available inputs, such as single-image, multi-image, and multi-study contexts. In addition to MRG, M4CXR performs visual grounding at a level comparable to specialized models and also demonstrates outstanding performance in VQA. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments reveal M4CXR's versatility in MRG, visual grounding, and VQA, while consistently maintaining clinical accuracy.|Jonggwon Park et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16213)|null|

We develop ReXamine-Global, a LLM-powered, multi-site framework that tests metrics across different writing styles and patient populations, exposing gaps in their generalization. First, our method tests whether a metric is undesirably sensitive to reporting style, providing different scores depending on whether AI-generated reports are stylistically similar to ground-truth reports or not. Second, our method measures whether a metric reliably agrees with experts, or whether metric and expert scores of AI-generated report quality diverge for some sites. Using 240 reports from 6 hospitals around the world, we apply ReXamine-Global to 7 established report evaluation metrics and uncover serious gaps in their generalizability. Developers can apply ReXamine-Global when designing new report evaluation metrics, ensuring their robustness across sites.

However, in medical domain, radiology report generation using vision-language models still faces significant challenges due to the imbalanced data distribution caused by numerous negated descriptions in radiology reports and issues such as rough alignment between radiology reports and radiography. In this paper, we propose a truthful radiology report generation framework, namely TRRG, based on stage-wise training for cross-modal disease clue injection into large language models. In pre-training stage, During the pre-training phase, contrastive learning is employed to enhance the ability of visual encoder to perceive fine-grained disease details. In fine-tuning stage, the clue injection module we proposed significantly enhances the disease-oriented perception capability of the large language model by effectively incorporating the robust zero-shot disease perception. Finally, through the cross-modal clue interaction module, our model effectively achieves the multi-granular interaction of visual embeddings and an arbitrary number of disease clue embeddings. This significantly enhances the report generation capability and clinical effectiveness of multi-modal large language models in the field of radiology reportgeneration. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed pre-training and fine-tuning framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in radiology report generation on datasets such as IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR.

While proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 are effective, they are costly and raise privacy concerns when handling protected health information. This study presents a pipeline for developing an in-house LLM to extract clinical information from radiology reports. We first use GPT-4 to create a small labeled dataset, then fine-tune a Llama3-8B model on it. Evaluated on clinician-annotated reports, our model achieves an average F1 score of 84.6%, which is on par with GPT-4.

They usually adopt a Transformer to extract the visual features of a given X-ray image, and then, feed them into the LLM for text generation. How to extract more effective information for the LLMs to help them improve final results is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Additionally, the use of visual Transformer models also brings high computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel context-guided efficient X-ray medical report generation framework. Specifically, we introduce the Mamba as the vision backbone with linear complexity, and the performance obtained is comparable to that of the strong Transformer model. More importantly, we perform context retrieval from the training set for samples within each mini-batch during the training phase, utilizing both positively and negatively related samples to enhance feature representation and discriminative learning. Subsequently, we feed the vision tokens, context information, and prompt statements to invoke the LLM for generating high-quality medical reports.

Accurate and timely identification of VTE is essential for effective medical care. This study builds upon our previous work, which addressed VTE detection using deep learning methods for DVT and a hybrid approach combining deep learning and rule-based classification for PE. Our earlier approaches, while effective, had two major limitations: they were complex and required expert involvement for feature engineering of the rule set. To overcome these challenges, we utilize the Mamba architecture-based classifier. This model achieves remarkable results, with a 97\% accuracy and F1 score on the DVT dataset and a 98\% accuracy and F1 score on the PE dataset. In contrast to the previous hybrid method on PE identification, the Mamba classifier eliminates the need for hand-engineered rules, significantly reducing model complexity while maintaining comparable performance. Additionally, we evaluated a lightweight Large Language Model (LLM), Phi-3 Mini, in detecting VTE. While this model delivers competitive results, outperforming the baseline BERT models, it proves to be computationally intensive due to its larger parameter set. Our evaluation shows that the Mamba-based model demonstrates superior performance and efficiency in VTE identification, offering an effective solution to the limitations of previous approaches.|Jamie Deng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09043)|null|
|**2024-08-16**|**ECG-Chat: A Large ECG-Language Model for Cardiac Disease Diagnosis**|The success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the medical auxiliary field shows great potential, allowing patients to engage in conversations using physiological signal data. However, general MLLMs perform poorly in cardiac disease diagnosis, particularly in the integration of ECG data analysis and long-text medical report generation, mainly due to the complexity of ECG data analysis and the gap between text and ECG signal modalities. Additionally, models often exhibit severe stability deficiencies in long-text generation due to the lack of precise knowledge strongly related to user queries. To address these issues, we propose ECG-Chat, the first multitask MLLMs focused on ECG medical report generation, providing multimodal conversational capabilities based on cardiology knowledge. We propose a contrastive learning approach that integrates ECG waveform data with text reports, aligning ECG features with reports in a fine-grained manner. This method also results in an ECG encoder that excels in zero-shot report retrieval tasks. Additionally, expanding existing datasets, we constructed a 19k ECG diagnosis dataset and a 25k multi-turn dialogue dataset for training and fine-tuning ECG-Chat, which provides professional diagnostic and conversational capabilities. Furthermore, ECG-Chat can generate comprehensive ECG analysis reports through an automated LaTeX generation pipeline. We established a benchmark for the ECG report generation task and tested our model on multiple baselines. ECG-Chat achieved the best performance in classification, retrieval, multimodal dialogue, and medical report generation tasks.

|**2025-03-28**|**Q-Insight: Understanding Image Quality via Visual Reinforcement Learning**|Image quality assessment (IQA) focuses on the perceptual visual quality of images, playing a crucial role in downstream tasks such as image reconstruction, compression, and generation. The rapid advancement of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly broadened the scope of IQA, moving toward comprehensive image quality understanding that incorporates content analysis, degradation perception, and comparison reasoning beyond mere numerical scoring. Previous MLLM-based methods typically either generate numerical scores lacking interpretability or heavily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using large-scale annotated datasets to provide descriptive assessments, limiting their flexibility and applicability. In this paper, we propose Q-Insight, a reinforcement learning-based model built upon group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which demonstrates strong visual reasoning capability for image quality understanding while requiring only a limited amount of rating scores and degradation labels. By jointly optimizing score regression and degradation perception tasks with carefully designed reward functions, our approach effectively exploits their mutual benefits for enhanced performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Insight substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both score regression and degradation perception tasks, while exhibiting impressive zero-shot generalization to comparison reasoning tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/lwq20020127/Q-Insight.|Weiqi Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22679)|**[link](https://github.com/lwq20020127/q-insight)**|
|**2025-03-28**|**Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Simulations for Realistic Clinical Interactions**|In this work, we introduce MedAgentSim, an open-source simulated clinical environment with doctor, patient, and measurement agents designed to evaluate and enhance LLM performance in dynamic diagnostic settings. Unlike prior approaches, our framework requires doctor agents to actively engage with patients through multi-turn conversations, requesting relevant medical examinations (e.g., temperature, blood pressure, ECG) and imaging results (e.g., MRI, X-ray) from a measurement agent to mimic the real-world diagnostic process. Additionally, we incorporate self improvement mechanisms that allow models to iteratively refine their diagnostic strategies. We enhance LLM performance in our simulated setting by integrating multi-agent discussions, chain-of-thought reasoning, and experience-based knowledge retrieval, facilitating progressive learning as doctor agents interact with more patients. We also introduce an evaluation benchmark for assessing the LLM's ability to engage in dynamic, context-aware diagnostic interactions. While MedAgentSim is fully automated, it also supports a user-controlled mode, enabling human interaction with either the doctor or patient agent. Comprehensive evaluations in various simulated diagnostic scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, simulation tool, and benchmark are available at \href{https://medagentsim.netlify.app/}.|Mohammad Almansoori et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22678)|null|
|**2025-03-28**|**QuestBench: Can LLMs ask the right question to acquire information in reasoning tasks?**|Recently, a large amount of work has focused on improving large language models' (LLMs') performance on reasoning benchmarks such as math and logic. However, past work has largely assumed that tasks are well-defined. In the real world, queries to LLMs are often underspecified, only solvable through acquiring missing information. We formalize this as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with missing variable assignments. Using a special case of this formalism where only one necessary variable assignment is missing, we can rigorously evaluate an LLM's ability to identify the minimal necessary question to ask and quantify axes of difficulty levels for each problem. We present QuestBench, a set of underspecified reasoning tasks solvable by asking at most one question, which includes: (1) Logic-Q: Logical reasoning tasks with one missing proposition, (2) Planning-Q: PDDL planning problems with initial states that are partially-observed, (3) GSM-Q: Human-annotated grade school math problems with one missing variable assignment, and (4) GSME-Q: a version of GSM-Q where word problems are translated into equations by human annotators. The LLM is tasked with selecting the correct clarification question(s) from a list of options. While state-of-the-art models excel at GSM-Q and GSME-Q, their accuracy is only 40-50% on Logic-Q and Planning-Q. Analysis demonstrates that the ability to solve well-specified reasoning problems may not be sufficient for success on our benchmark: models have difficulty identifying the right question to ask, even when they can solve the fully specified version of the problem. Furthermore, in the Planning-Q domain, LLMs tend not to hedge, even when explicitly presented with the option to predict ``not sure.'' This highlights the need for deeper investigation into models' information acquisition capabilities.|Belinda Z. Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22674)|null|
|**2025-03-28**|**Exploring the Effectiveness of Multi-stage Fine-tuning for Cross-encoder Re-rankers**|State-of-the-art cross-encoders can be fine-tuned to be highly effective in passage re-ranking. The typical fine-tuning process of cross-encoders as re-rankers requires large amounts of manually labelled data, a contrastive learning objective, and a set of heuristically sampled negatives. An alternative recent approach for fine-tuning instead involves teaching the model to mimic the rankings of a highly effective large language model using a distillation objective. These fine-tuning strategies can be applied either individually, or in sequence. In this work, we systematically investigate the effectiveness of point-wise cross-encoders when fine-tuned independently in a single stage, or sequentially in two stages. Our experiments show that the effectiveness of point-wise cross-encoders fine-tuned using contrastive learning is indeed on par with that of models fine-tuned with multi-stage approaches.

|**2025-03-28**|**Unicorn: Text-Only Data Synthesis for Vision Language Model Training**|Training vision-language models (VLMs) typically requires large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs, but collecting or synthesizing such data is costly. In contrast, text data is abundant and inexpensive, prompting the question: can high-quality multimodal training data be synthesized purely from text? To tackle this, we propose a cross-integrated three-stage multimodal data synthesis framework, which generates two datasets: Unicorn-1.2M and Unicorn-471K-Instruction. In Stage 1: Diverse Caption Data Synthesis, we construct 1.2M semantically diverse high-quality captions by expanding sparse caption seeds using large language models (LLMs). In Stage 2: Instruction-Tuning Data Generation, we further process 471K captions into multi-turn instruction-tuning tasks to support complex reasoning. Finally, in Stage 3: Modality Representation Transfer, these textual captions representations are transformed into visual representations, resulting in diverse synthetic image representations. This three-stage process enables us to construct Unicorn-1.2M for pretraining and Unicorn-471K-Instruction for instruction-tuning, without relying on real images. By eliminating the dependency on real images while maintaining data quality and diversity, our framework offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for VLMs training.

|**2025-03-28**|**Evaluating Multimodal Language Models as Visual Assistants for Visually Impaired Users**|This paper explores the effectiveness of Multimodal Large Language models (MLLMs) as assistive technologies for visually impaired individuals. We conduct a user survey to identify adoption patterns and key challenges users face with such technologies. Despite a high adoption rate of these models, our findings highlight concerns related to contextual understanding, cultural sensitivity, and complex scene understanding, particularly for individuals who may rely solely on them for visual interpretation. Informed by these results, we collate five user-centred tasks with image and video inputs, including a novel task on Optical Braille Recognition. Our systematic evaluation of twelve MLLMs reveals that further advancements are necessary to overcome limitations related to cultural context, multilingual support, Braille reading comprehension, assistive object recognition, and hallucinations. This work provides critical insights into the future direction of multimodal AI for accessibility, underscoring the need for more inclusive, robust, and trustworthy visual assistance technologies.|Antonia Karamolegkou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22610)|null|

Using expert statements from the Science Media Center Germany as a dataset, we analyze Research in Context reviews to examine the alignment between qualitative post-publication assessments and bibliometric as well as altmetric indicators. We employ a Large Language Model to translate unstructured expert reviews into a structured rating scheme. Furthermore, we correlate these evaluations with citation counts from the Web of Science and alternative impact metrics such as the Altmetric Attention Score, news mentions, and Mendeley readership statistics from the Altmetric Explorer. We investigate the alignment of positive or critical post-publication reviews and high or low citation or altmetric counts.|Dirk Tunger et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22594)|null|
|**2025-03-28**|**Using AI to Summarize US Presidential Campaign TV Advertisement Videos, 1952-2012**|This paper introduces the largest and most comprehensive dataset of US presidential campaign television advertisements, available in digital format. The dataset also includes machine-searchable transcripts and high-quality summaries designed to facilitate a variety of academic research. To date, there has been great interest in collecting and analyzing US presidential campaign advertisements, but the need for manual procurement and annotation led many to rely on smaller subsets. We design a large-scale parallelized, AI-based analysis pipeline that automates the laborious process of preparing, transcribing, and summarizing videos. We then apply this methodology to the 9,707 presidential ads from the Julian P. Kanter Political Commercial Archive. We conduct extensive human evaluations to show that these transcripts and summaries match the quality of manually generated alternatives. We illustrate the value of this data by including an application that tracks the genesis and evolution of current focal issue areas over seven decades of presidential elections. Our analysis pipeline and codebase also show how to use LLM-based tools to obtain high-quality summaries for other video datasets.|Adam Breuer et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22589)|null|
|**2025-03-28**|**LLM-enabled Instance Model Generation**|In the domain of model-based engineering, models are essential components that enable system design and analysis. Traditionally, the creation of these models has been a manual process requiring not only deep modeling expertise but also substantial domain knowledge of target systems. With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) show potential for automating model generation. This work explores the generation of instance models using LLMs, focusing specifically on producing XMI-based instance models from Ecore metamodels and natural language specifications. We observe that current LLMs struggle to directly generate valid XMI models. To address this, we propose a two-step approach: first, using LLMs to produce a simplified structured output containing all necessary instance model information, namely a conceptual instance model, and then compiling this intermediate representation into a valid XMI file. The conceptual instance model is format-independent, allowing it to be transformed into various modeling formats via different compilers. The feasibility of the proposed method has been demonstrated using several LLMs, including GPT-4o, o1-preview, Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B). Results show that the proposed method significantly improves the usability of LLMs for instance model generation tasks. Notably, the smaller open-source model, Llama 3.1 70B, demonstrated performance comparable to proprietary GPT models within the proposed framework.|Fengjunjie Pan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22587)|null|
|**2025-03-28**|**Historical Ink: Exploring Large Language Models for Irony Detection in 19th-Century Spanish**|This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to enhance datasets and improve irony detection in 19th-century Latin American newspapers. Two strategies were employed to evaluate the efficacy of BERT and GPT-4o models in capturing the subtle nuances nature of irony, through both multi-class and binary classification tasks. First, we implemented dataset enhancements focused on enriching emotional and contextual cues; however, these showed limited impact on historical language analysis. The second strategy, a semi-automated annotation process, effectively addressed class imbalance and augmented the dataset with high-quality annotations. Despite the challenges posed by the complexity of irony, this work contributes to the advancement of sentiment analysis through two key contributions: introducing a new historical Spanish dataset tagged for sentiment analysis and irony detection, and proposing a semi-automated annotation methodology where human expertise is crucial for refining LLMs results, enriched by incorporating historical and cultural contexts as core features.|Kevin Cohen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22585)|**[link](https://github.com/historicalink/ironydetection)**|
|**2025-03-27**|**Video-R1: Reinforcing Video Reasoning in MLLMs**|Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first attempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for eliciting video reasoning within multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-COT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 35.8% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o.

|**2025-03-27**|**MemInsight: Autonomous Memory Augmentation for LLM Agents**|Large language model (LLM) agents have evolved to intelligently process information, make decisions, and interact with users or tools. A key capability is the integration of long-term memory capabilities, enabling these agents to draw upon historical interactions and knowledge. However, the growing memory size and need for semantic structuring pose significant challenges. In this work, we propose an autonomous memory augmentation approach, MemInsight, to enhance semantic data representation and retrieval mechanisms. By leveraging autonomous augmentation to historical interactions, LLM agents are shown to deliver more accurate and contextualized responses. We empirically validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in three task scenarios; conversational recommendation, question answering and event summarization. On the LLM-REDIAL dataset, MemInsight boosts persuasiveness of recommendations by up to 14%. Moreover, it outperforms a RAG baseline by 34% in recall for LoCoMo retrieval. Our empirical results show the potential of MemInsight to enhance the contextual performance of LLM agents across multiple tasks.|Rana Salama et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21760)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**Fwd2Bot: LVLM Visual Token Compression with Double Forward Bottleneck**|In this work, we aim to compress the vision tokens of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) into a representation that is simultaneously suitable for (a) generative and (b) discriminative tasks, (c) is nearly lossless, and (d) is storage-efficient. We propose a novel compression approach, called Fwd2Bot, that uses the LVLM itself to compress the visual information in a task-agnostic manner. At the core of Fwd2bot there exists a "double-forward pass" training strategy, whereby, during the first forward pass, the LLM (of the LVLM) creates a bottleneck by condensing the visual information into a small number of summary tokens. Then, using the same LLM, the second forward pass processes the language instruction(s) alongside the summary tokens, used as a direct replacement for the image ones. The training signal is provided by two losses: an autoregressive one applied after the second pass that provides a direct optimization objective for compression, and a contrastive loss, applied after the first pass, that further boosts the representation strength, especially for discriminative tasks. The training is further enhanced by stage-specific adapters. We accompany the proposed method by an in-depth ablation study. Overall, Fwd2Bot results in highly-informative compressed representations suitable for both generative and discriminative tasks. For generative tasks, we offer a 2x higher compression rate without compromising the generative capabilities, setting a new state-of-the-art result. For discriminative tasks, we set a new state-of-the-art on image retrieval and compositionality.|Adrian Bulat et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21757)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**VBench-2.0: Advancing Video Generation Benchmark Suite for Intrinsic Faithfulness**|Video generation has advanced significantly, evolving from producing unrealistic outputs to generating videos that appear visually convincing and temporally coherent. To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence. However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real "world models" through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning, anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored for individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such as state-of-the-art VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive annotations to ensure alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of intrinsic faithfulness.|Dian Zheng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21755)|**[link](https://github.com/vchitect/vbench)**|
|**2025-03-27**|**GateLens: A Reasoning-Enhanced LLM Agent for Automotive Software Release Analytics**|Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of software release decisions is critical, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive systems. Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form, plays a pivotal role in this process. However, traditional methods that rely on manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to delays and high costs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then generates optimized Python code. It outperforms the baseline system on benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and ambiguous queries with greater robustness. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted. Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80% while maintaining high accuracy and reliability. As demonstrated by presented results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from diverse company roles. Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical workflows such as release validation. Results show that by automating test result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in automotive systems.|Arsham Gholamzadeh Khoee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21735)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**Effective Skill Unlearning through Intervention and Abstention**|Large language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable skills across various domains. Understanding the mechanisms behind their abilities and implementing controls over them is becoming increasingly important for developing better models. In this paper, we focus on skill unlearning in LLMs, specifically unlearning a particular skill while retaining their overall capabilities. We introduce two lightweight, training-free machine skill unlearning techniques for LLMs. First, we observe that the pre-activation distribution of neurons in each Feed-Forward Layer (FFL) differs when the model demonstrates different skills. Additionally, we find that queries triggering the same skill cluster within the FFL key space and can be separated from other queries using a hypercube. Based on these observations, we propose two lightweight, training-free skill unlearning methods via \textit{intervention} and \textit{abstention} respectively: \texttt{Neuron Adjust} and \texttt{Key Space Detection}. We evaluate our methods on unlearning math-solving, Python-coding, and comprehension skills across seven different languages. The results demonstrate their strong unlearning capabilities for the designated skills. Specifically, \texttt{Key Space Detection} achieves over 80\% relative performance drop on the forgetting skill and less than 10\% relative performance drop on other skills and the model's general knowledge (MMLU) for most unlearning tasks.

|**2025-03-27**|**ReaRAG: Knowledge-guided Reasoning Enhances Factuality of Large Reasoning Models with Iterative Retrieval Augmented Generation**|Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning abilities but rely primarily on parametric knowledge, limiting factual accuracy. While recent works equip reinforcement learning (RL)-based LRMs with retrieval capabilities, they suffer from overthinking and lack robustness in reasoning, reducing their effectiveness in question answering (QA) tasks. To address this, we propose ReaRAG, a factuality-enhanced reasoning model that explores diverse queries without excessive iterations. Our solution includes a novel data construction framework with an upper bound on the reasoning chain length. Specifically, we first leverage an LRM to generate deliberate thinking, then select an action from a predefined action space (Search and Finish). For Search action, a query is executed against the RAG engine, where the result is returned as observation to guide reasoning steps later. This process iterates until a Finish action is chosen. Benefiting from ReaRAG's strong reasoning capabilities, our approach outperforms existing baselines on multi-hop QA. Further analysis highlights its strong reflective ability to recognize errors and refine its reasoning trajectory. Our study enhances LRMs' factuality while effectively integrating robust reasoning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).|Zhicheng Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21729)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**Collab: Controlled Decoding using Mixture of Agents for LLM Alignment**|Alignment of Large Language models (LLMs) is crucial for safe and trustworthy deployment in applications. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an effective technique to align LLMs to human preferences and broader utilities, but it requires updating billions of model parameters, which is computationally expensive. Controlled Decoding, by contrast, provides a mechanism for aligning a model at inference time without retraining. However, single-agent decoding approaches often struggle to adapt to diverse tasks due to the complexity and variability inherent in these tasks. To strengthen the test-time performance w.r.t the target task, we propose a mixture of agent-based decoding strategies leveraging the existing off-the-shelf aligned LLM policies. Treating each prior policy as an agent in the spirit of mixture of agent collaboration, we develop a decoding method that allows for inference-time alignment through a token-level selection strategy among multiple agents. For each token, the most suitable LLM is dynamically chosen from a pool of models based on a long-term utility metric. This policy-switching mechanism ensures optimal model selection at each step, enabling efficient collaboration and alignment among LLMs during decoding. Theoretical analysis of our proposed algorithm establishes optimal performance with respect to the target task represented via a target reward for the given off-the-shelf models. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations with open-source aligned models on diverse tasks and preferences, which demonstrates the merits of this approach over single-agent decoding baselines. Notably, Collab surpasses the current SoTA decoding strategy, achieving an improvement of up to 1.56x in average reward and 71.89% in GPT-4 based win-tie rate.|Souradip Chakraborty et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21720)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**CLAIMCHECK: How Grounded are LLM Critiques of Scientific Papers?**|A core part of scientific peer review involves providing expert critiques that directly assess the scientific claims a paper makes. While it is now possible to automatically generate plausible (if generic) reviews, ensuring that these reviews are sound and grounded in the papers' claims remains challenging. To facilitate LLM benchmarking on these challenges, we introduce CLAIMCHECK, an annotated dataset of NeurIPS 2023 and 2024 submissions and reviews mined from OpenReview. CLAIMCHECK is richly annotated by ML experts for weakness statements in the reviews and the paper claims that they dispute, as well as fine-grained labels of the validity, objectivity, and type of the identified weaknesses. We benchmark several LLMs on three claim-centric tasks supported by CLAIMCHECK, requiring models to (1) associate weaknesses with the claims they dispute, (2) predict fine-grained labels for weaknesses and rewrite the weaknesses to enhance their specificity, and (3) verify a paper's claims with grounded reasoning. Our experiments reveal that cutting-edge LLMs, while capable of predicting weakness labels in (2), continue to underperform relative to human experts on all other tasks.|Jiefu Ou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21717)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**Enhancing Repository-Level Software Repair via Repository-Aware Knowledge Graphs**|Repository-level software repair faces challenges in bridging semantic gaps between issue descriptions and code patches. Existing approaches, which mostly depend on large language models (LLMs), suffer from semantic ambiguities, limited structural context understanding, and insufficient reasoning capability. To address these limitations, we propose KGCompass with two innovations: (1) a novel repository-aware knowledge graph (KG) that accurately links repository artifacts (issues and pull requests) and codebase entities (files, classes, and functions), allowing us to effectively narrow down the vast search space to only 20 most relevant functions with accurate candidate bug locations and contextual information, and (2) a path-guided repair mechanism that leverages KG-mined entity path, tracing through which allows us to augment LLMs with relevant contextual information to generate precise patches along with their explanations. Experimental results in the SWE-Bench-Lite demonstrate that KGCompass achieves state-of-the-art repair performance (45.67%) and function-level localization accuracy (51.33%) across open-source approaches, costing only $0.20 per repair. Our analysis reveals that among successfully localized bugs, 69.7% require multi-hop traversals through the knowledge graph, without which LLM-based approaches struggle to accurately locate bugs. The knowledge graph built in KGCompass is language agnostic and can be incrementally updated, making it a practical solution for real-world development environments.|Boyang Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21710)|null|
|**2025-03-26**|**Mobile-MMLU: A Mobile Intelligence Language Understanding Benchmark**|Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have increased interest in deploying them on mobile devices for on-device AI applications. Mobile users interact differently with LLMs compared to desktop users, creating unique expectations and data biases. Current benchmark datasets primarily target at server and desktop environments, and there is a notable lack of extensive datasets specifically designed for mobile contexts. Additionally, mobile devices face strict limitations in storage and computing resources, constraining model size and capabilities, thus requiring optimized efficiency and prioritized knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce Mobile-MMLU, a large-scale benchmark dataset tailored for mobile intelligence. It consists of 16,186 questions across 80 mobile-related fields, designed to evaluate LLM performance in realistic mobile scenarios. A challenging subset, Mobile-MMLU-Pro, provides advanced evaluation similar in size to MMLU-Pro but significantly more difficult than our standard full set. Both benchmarks use multiple-choice, order-invariant questions focused on practical mobile interactions, such as recipe suggestions, travel planning, and essential daily tasks. The dataset emphasizes critical mobile-specific metrics like inference latency, energy consumption, memory usage, and response quality, offering comprehensive insights into model performance under mobile constraints. Moreover, it prioritizes privacy and adaptability, assessing models' ability to perform on-device processing, maintain user privacy, and adapt to personalized usage patterns. Mobile-MMLU family offers a standardized framework for developing and comparing mobile-optimized LLMs, enabling advancements in productivity and decision-making within mobile computing environments.

|**2025-03-26**|**Understanding R1-Zero-Like Training: A Critical Perspective**|DeepSeek-R1-Zero has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) at scale can directly enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without supervised fine-tuning. In this work, we critically examine R1-Zero-like training by analyzing its two core components: base models and RL. We investigate a wide range of base models, including DeepSeek-V3-Base, to understand how pretraining characteristics influence RL performance. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek-V3-Base already exhibit ''Aha moment'', while Qwen2.5 base models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities even without prompt templates, suggesting potential pretraining biases. Additionally, we identify an optimization bias in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which artificially increases response length (especially for incorrect outputs) during training. To address this, we introduce Dr. GRPO, an unbiased optimization method that improves token efficiency while maintaining reasoning performance. Leveraging these insights, we present a minimalist R1-Zero recipe that achieves 43.3% accuracy on AIME 2024 with a 7B base model, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

However, extending these achievements to enable free-form interactions and high-level semantic operations with complex 3D/4D scenes remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the limited availability of large-scale, annotated 3D/4D or multi-view datasets, which are crucial for generalizable vision and language tasks such as open-vocabulary and prompt-based segmentation, language-guided editing, and visual question answering (VQA). In this paper, we introduce Feature4X, a universal framework designed to extend any functionality from 2D vision foundation model into the 4D realm, using only monocular video input, which is widely available from user-generated content. The "X" in Feature4X represents its versatility, enabling any task through adaptable, model-conditioned 4D feature field distillation. At the core of our framework is a dynamic optimization strategy that unifies multiple model capabilities into a single representation. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, Feature4X is the first method to distill and lift the features of video foundation models (e.g. SAM2, InternVideo2) into an explicit 4D feature field using Gaussian Splatting.

|**2025-03-26**|**MCTS-RAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Monte Carlo Tree Search**|We introduce MCTS-RAG, a novel approach that enhances the reasoning capabilities of small language models on knowledge-intensive tasks by leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide relevant context and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to refine reasoning paths. MCTS-RAG dynamically integrates retrieval and reasoning through an iterative decision-making process. Unlike standard RAG methods, which typically retrieve information independently from reasoning and thus integrate knowledge suboptimally, or conventional MCTS reasoning, which depends solely on internal model knowledge without external facts, MCTS-RAG combines structured reasoning with adaptive retrieval. This integrated approach enhances decision-making, reduces hallucinations, and ensures improved factual accuracy and response consistency. The experimental results on multiple reasoning and knowledge-intensive datasets datasets (i.e., ComplexWebQA, GPQA, and FoolMeTwice) show that our method enables small-scale LMs to achieve performance comparable to frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by effectively scaling inference-time compute, setting a new standard for reasoning in small-scale models.|Yunhai Hu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20757)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**Beyond Believability: Accurate Human Behavior Simulation with Fine-Tuned LLMs**|Recent research shows that LLMs can simulate ``believable'' human behaviors to power LLM agents via prompt-only methods. In this work, we focus on evaluating and improving LLM's objective ``accuracy'' rather than the subjective ``believability'' in the web action generation task, leveraging a large-scale, real-world dataset collected from online shopping human actions. We present the first comprehensive quantitative evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Llama, and Claude) on the task of web action generation. Our results show that fine-tuning LLMs on real-world behavioral data substantially improves their ability to generate actions compared to prompt-only methods. Furthermore, incorporating synthesized reasoning traces into model training leads to additional performance gains, demonstrating the value of explicit rationale in behavior modeling. This work establishes a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in behavior simulation and offers actionable insights into how real-world action data and reasoning augmentation can enhance the fidelity of LLM agents.|Yuxuan Lu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20749)|null|
|**2025-03-26**|**MATHGLANCE: Multimodal Large Language Models Do Not Know Where to Look in Mathematical Diagrams**|Diagrams serve as a fundamental form of visual language, representing complex concepts and their inter-relationships through structured symbols, shapes, and spatial arrangements. Unlike natural images, their inherently symbolic and abstract nature poses significant challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning tasks, making it difficult to assess whether MLLMs genuinely understand mathematical diagrams beyond superficial pattern recognition. To address this gap, we introduce MATHGLANCE, a benchmark specifically designed to isolate and evaluate mathematical perception in MLLMs. MATHGLANCE comprises 1.2K images and 1.6K carefully curated questions spanning four perception tasks: shape classification, object counting, relationship identification, and object grounding, covering diverse domains including plane geometry, solid geometry, and graphical representations. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals that their ability to understand diagrams is notably limited, particularly in fine-grained grounding tasks. In response, we construct GeoPeP, a perception-oriented dataset of 200K structured geometry image-text pairs explicitly annotated with geometric primitives and precise spatial relationships. Training MLLM on GeoPeP leads to significant gains in perceptual accuracy, which in turn substantially improves mathematical reasoning. Our benchmark and dataset establish critical standards for evaluating and advancing multimodal mathematical understanding, providing valuable resources and insights to foster future MLLM research.|Yanpeng Sun et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20745)|null|
|**2025-03-26**|**Dynamic Motion Blending for Versatile Motion Editing**|Text-guided motion editing enables high-level semantic control and iterative modifications beyond traditional keyframe animation. Existing methods rely on limited pre-collected training triplets, which severely hinders their versatility in diverse editing scenarios. We introduce MotionCutMix, an online data augmentation technique that dynamically generates training triplets by blending body part motions based on input text. While MotionCutMix effectively expands the training distribution, the compositional nature introduces increased randomness and potential body part incoordination. To model such a rich distribution, we present MotionReFit, an auto-regressive diffusion model with a motion coordinator. The auto-regressive architecture facilitates learning by decomposing long sequences, while the motion coordinator mitigates the artifacts of motion composition. Our method handles both spatial and temporal motion edits directly from high-level human instructions, without relying on additional specifications or Large Language Models. Through extensive experiments, we show that MotionReFit achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-guided motion editing.|Nan Jiang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20724)|null|

|**2025-03-26**|**GLRD: Global-Local Collaborative Reason and Debate with PSL for 3D Open-Vocabulary Detection**|The task of LiDAR-based 3D Open-Vocabulary Detection (3D OVD) requires the detector to learn to detect novel objects from point clouds without off-the-shelf training labels. Previous methods focus on the learning of object-level representations and ignore the scene-level information, thus it is hard to distinguish objects with similar classes. In this work, we propose a Global-Local Collaborative Reason and Debate with PSL (GLRD) framework for the 3D OVD task, considering both local object-level information and global scene-level information. Specifically, LLM is utilized to perform common sense reasoning based on object-level and scene-level information, where the detection result is refined accordingly. To further boost the LLM's ability of precise decisions, we also design a probabilistic soft logic solver (OV-PSL) to search for the optimal solution, and a debate scheme to confirm the class of confusable objects. In addition, to alleviate the uneven distribution of classes, a static balance scheme (SBC) and a dynamic balance scheme (DBC) are designed. In addition, to reduce the influence of noise in data and training, we further propose Reflected Pseudo Labels Generation (RPLG) and Background-Aware Object Localization (BAOL). Extensive experiments conducted on ScanNet and SUN RGB-D demonstrate the superiority of GLRD, where absolute improvements in mean average precision are $+2.82\%$ on SUN RGB-D and $+3.72\%$ on ScanNet in the partial open-vocabulary setting. In the full open-vocabulary setting, the absolute improvements in mean average precision are $+4.03\%$ on ScanNet and $+14.11\%$ on SUN RGB-D.|Xingyu Peng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20682)|null|
|**2025-03-26**|**Vision as LoRA**|We introduce Vision as LoRA (VoRA), a novel paradigm for transforming an LLM into an MLLM. Unlike prevalent MLLM architectures that rely on external vision modules for vision encoding, VoRA internalizes visual capabilities by integrating vision-specific LoRA layers directly into the LLM. This design allows the added parameters to be seamlessly merged into the LLM during inference, eliminating structural complexity and minimizing computational overhead. Moreover, inheriting the LLM's ability of handling flexible context, VoRA can process inputs at arbitrary resolutions.   To further strengthen VoRA's visual capabilities, we introduce a block-wise distillation method that transfers visual priors from a pre-trained ViT into the LoRA layers, effectively accelerating training by injecting visual knowledge. Additionally, we apply bi-directional attention masks to better capture the context information of an image. We successfully demonstrate that with additional pre-training data, VoRA can perform comparably with conventional encode-based MLLMs. All training data, codes, and model weights will be released at https://github.com/Hon-Wong/VoRA.|Han Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20680)|null|
|**2025-03-25**|**CoLLM: A Large Language Model for Composed Image Retrieval**|Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a complex task that aims to retrieve images based on a multimodal query. Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs. However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data. Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities. We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations. Our approach generates triplets on-the-fly from image-caption pairs, enabling supervised training without manual annotation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate joint embeddings of reference images and modification texts, facilitating deeper multimodal fusion. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Text CIR (MTCIR), a large-scale dataset comprising 3.4M samples, and refine existing CIR benchmarks (CIRR and Fashion-IQ) to enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple CIR benchmarks and settings. MTCIR yields competitive results, with up to 15% performance improvement. Our refined benchmarks provide more reliable evaluation metrics for CIR models, contributing to the advancement of this important field.|Chuong Huynh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19910)|**[link](https://github.com/hmchuong/CoLLM)**|
|**2025-03-25**|**Scaling Vision Pre-Training to 4K Resolution**|High-resolution perception of visual details is crucial for daily tasks. Current vision pre-training, however, is still limited to low resolutions (e.g., 378 x 378 pixels) due to the quadratic cost of processing larger images. We introduce PS3 that scales CLIP-style vision pre-training to 4K resolution with a near-constant cost. Instead of contrastive learning on global image representation, PS3 is pre-trained by selectively processing local regions and contrasting them with local detailed captions, enabling high-resolution representation learning with greatly reduced computational overhead. The pre-trained PS3 is able to both encode the global image at low resolution and selectively process local high-resolution regions based on their saliency or relevance to a text prompt. When applying PS3 to multi-modal LLM (MLLM), the resulting model, named VILA-HD, significantly improves high-resolution visual perception compared to baselines without high-resolution vision pre-training such as AnyRes and S^2 while using up to 4.3x fewer tokens. PS3 also unlocks appealing scaling properties of VILA-HD, including scaling up resolution for free and scaling up test-time compute for better performance. Compared to state of the arts, VILA-HD outperforms previous MLLMs such as NVILA and Qwen2-VL across multiple benchmarks and achieves better efficiency than latest token pruning approaches. Finally, we find current benchmarks do not require 4K-resolution perception, which motivates us to propose 4KPro, a new benchmark of image QA at 4K resolution, on which VILA-HD outperforms all previous MLLMs, including a 14.5% improvement over GPT-4o, and a 3.2% improvement and 2.96x speedup over Qwen2-VL.|Baifeng Shi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19903)|null|
|**2025-03-25**|**A Multi-Agent Framework Integrating Large Language Models and Generative AI for Accelerated Metamaterial Design**|Metamaterials, renowned for their exceptional mechanical, electromagnetic, and thermal properties, hold transformative potential across diverse applications, yet their design remains constrained by labor-intensive trial-and-error methods and limited data interoperability. Here, we introduce CrossMatAgent--a novel multi-agent framework that synergistically integrates large language models with state-of-the-art generative AI to revolutionize metamaterial design. By orchestrating a hierarchical team of agents--each specializing in tasks such as pattern analysis, architectural synthesis, prompt engineering, and supervisory feedback--our system leverages the multimodal reasoning of GPT-4o alongside the generative precision of DALL-E 3 and a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion XL model. This integrated approach automates data augmentation, enhances design fidelity, and produces simulation- and 3D printing-ready metamaterial patterns. Comprehensive evaluations, including CLIP-based alignment, SHAP interpretability analyses, and mechanical simulations under varied load conditions, demonstrate the framework's ability to generate diverse, reproducible, and application-ready designs. CrossMatAgent thus establishes a scalable, AI-driven paradigm that bridges the gap between conceptual innovation and practical realization, paving the way for accelerated metamaterial development.|Jie Tian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19889)|null|

However, traditional RAG systems face critical limitations, including disrupted contextual integrity due to text chunking, and over-reliance on semantic similarity for retrieval. To address these issues, we propose CausalRAG, a novel framework that incorporates causal graphs into the retrieval process. By constructing and tracing causal relationships, CausalRAG preserves contextual continuity and improves retrieval precision, leading to more accurate and interpretable responses. We evaluate CausalRAG against regular RAG and graph-based RAG approaches, demonstrating its superiority across several metrics. Our findings suggest that grounding retrieval in causal reasoning provides a promising approach to knowledge-intensive tasks.|Nengbo Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19878)|null|
|**2025-03-25**|**SLA-Awareness for AI-assisted coding**|The integration of AI-assisted coding tools within development environments drastically reduces development time, and allows developers to focus more on creative and critical aspects of software engineering through the use of Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs). These coding assistants automate repetitive and time-consuming coding tasks such as code generation, code completion, code summarization, and code translation. Responsiveness is a crucial requirement of these coding assistants to maintain real-time interactivity, such that their use does not impede the developers' workflows. Different coding tasks have unique characteristics and latency requirements: Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) latency is essential for code completion tasks, while End-To-End (E2E) latency is crucial for code translation tasks. Managing these varying requirements simultaneously while optimizing resource usage poses significant challenges. Existing work adopts the Model-as-a-Service paradigm for serving individual CodeLLMs, but cannot effectively manage latency requirements of concurrent coding tasks and sequences of CodeLLM inference calls, due to a lack of end-to-end latency awareness. Another challenge is keeping resource utilization high, when the serving system is deployed on a shared cluster environment. To address these challenges, we propose Coding Assistant Task Orchestrator (CATO), a runtime system designed to serve a diverse assortment of coding tasks while meeting latency requirements and maximizing resource utilization. Our experiments demonstrate that when all types of coding tasks were served simultaneously, for TTFT-critical tasks, CATO improves overall Goodput rate and resource utilization by up to 10% and 41.1%, respectively. P95 E2E latency was also reduced by 18% for code summarization tasks, and P95 TTFT for code generation tasks were reduced by 14% compared against state-of-the-art systems.|Kishanthan Thangarajah et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19876)|null|
|**2025-03-25**|**Think Twice: Enhancing LLM Reasoning by Scaling Multi-round Test-time Thinking**|Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated the effectiveness of test-time scaling, where extended reasoning processes substantially enhance model performance. Despite this, current models are constrained by limitations in handling long texts and reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective test-time scaling approach Multi-round Thinking. This method iteratively refines model reasoning by leveraging previous answers as prompts for subsequent rounds. Extensive experiments across multiple models, including QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1, consistently show performance improvements on various benchmarks such as AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA-diamond, and LiveCodeBench. For instance, the accuracy of QwQ-32B improved from 80.3% (Round 1) to 82.1% (Round 2) on the AIME 2024 dataset, while DeepSeek-R1 showed a similar increase from 79.7% to 82.0%. These results confirm that Multi-round Thinking is a broadly applicable, straightforward approach to achieving stable enhancements in model performance, underscoring its potential for future developments in test-time scaling techniques.

|**2025-03-25**|**Towards Online Multi-Modal Social Interaction Understanding**|Multimodal social interaction understanding (MMSI) is critical in human-robot interaction systems. In real-world scenarios, AI agents are required to provide real-time feedback. However, existing models often depend on both past and future contexts, which hinders them from applying to real-world problems. To bridge this gap, we propose an online MMSI setting, where the model must resolve MMSI tasks using only historical information, such as recorded dialogues and video streams. To address the challenges of missing the useful future context, we develop a novel framework, named Online-MMSI-VLM, that leverages two complementary strategies: multi-party conversation forecasting and social-aware visual prompting with multi-modal large language models. First, to enrich linguistic context, the multi-party conversation forecasting simulates potential future utterances in a coarse-to-fine manner, anticipating upcoming speaker turns and then generating fine-grained conversational details. Second, to effectively incorporate visual social cues like gaze and gesture, social-aware visual prompting highlights the social dynamics in video with bounding boxes and body keypoints for each person and frame. Extensive experiments on three tasks and two datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms baseline models, indicating its effectiveness on Online-MMSI.

|**2025-03-25**|**FALCONEye: Finding Answers and Localizing Content in ONE-hour-long videos with multi-modal LLMs**|Information retrieval in hour-long videos presents a significant challenge, even for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs), particularly when the desired information is localized within a small subset of frames. Long video data presents challenges for VLMs due to context window limitations and the difficulty of pinpointing frames containing the answer. Our novel video agent, FALCONEye, combines a VLM and a Large Language Model (LLM) to search relevant information along the video, and locate the frames with the answer. FALCONEye novelty relies on 1) the proposed meta-architecture, which is better suited to tackle hour-long videos compared to short video approaches in the state-of-the-art; 2) a new efficient exploration algorithm to locate the information using short clips, captions and answer confidence; and 3) our state-of-the-art VLMs calibration analysis for the answer confidence. Our agent is built over a small-size VLM and a medium-size LLM being accessible to run on standard computational resources. We also release FALCON-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate long (average > 1 hour) Video Answer Search challenges, highlighting the need for open-ended question evaluation. Our experiments show FALCONEye's superior performance than the state-of-the-art in FALCON-Bench, and similar or better performance in related benchmarks.|Carlos Plou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19850)|null|

Historical Chinese documents pose challenges for text analysis due to their logographic script, the absence of natural word boundaries, and significant linguistic changes. Using a sample dataset from the Shanghai Library Republican Journal corpus, traditional tools such as Jieba and spaCy are compared to LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and the GLM series. The results show that LLMs outperform traditional methods in all metrics, albeit at considerably higher computational costs, highlighting a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, LLMs better handle genre-specific challenges such as poetry and temporal variations (i.e., pre-1920 versus post-1920 texts), demonstrating that their contextual learning capabilities can advance NLP approaches to historical texts by reducing the need for domain-specific training data.|Zhao Fang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19844)|null|
|**2025-03-25**|**FireEdit: Fine-grained Instruction-based Image Editing via Region-aware Vision Language Model**|Currently, instruction-based image editing methods have made significant progress by leveraging the powerful cross-modal understanding capabilities of vision language models (VLMs). However, they still face challenges in three key areas: 1) complex scenarios; 2) semantic consistency; and 3) fine-grained editing. To address these issues, we propose FireEdit, an innovative Fine-grained Instruction-based image editing framework that exploits a REgion-aware VLM. FireEdit is designed to accurately comprehend user instructions and ensure effective control over the editing process. Specifically, we enhance the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of the VLM by introducing additional region tokens. Relying solely on the output of the LLM to guide the diffusion model may lead to suboptimal editing results. Therefore, we propose a Time-Aware Target Injection module and a Hybrid Visual Cross Attention module. The former dynamically adjusts the guidance strength at various denoising stages by integrating timestep embeddings with the text embeddings. The latter enhances visual details for image editing, thereby preserving semantic consistency between the edited result and the source image. By combining the VLM enhanced with fine-grained region tokens and the time-dependent diffusion model, FireEdit demonstrates significant advantages in comprehending editing instructions and maintaining high semantic consistency. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art instruction-based image editing methods.

|**2025-03-24**|**Video-T1: Test-Time Scaling for Video Generation**|With the scale capability of increasing training data, model size, and computational cost, video generation has achieved impressive results in digital creation, enabling users to express creativity across various domains. Recently, researchers in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded the scaling to test-time, which can significantly improve LLM performance by using more inference-time computation. Instead of scaling up video foundation models through expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling (TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation model is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt. In this work, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching problem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target video distribution. Specifically, we build the search space with test-time verifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching process. Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search strategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. As full-step denoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs, we further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called Tree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on text-conditioned video generation benchmarks demonstrate that increasing test-time compute consistently leads to significant improvements in the quality of videos.

Although promising, the mechanisms that underpin its performance and scalability remain largely unclear. We conduct a systematic investigation of training and inference scaling laws in generative retrieval, exploring how model size, training data scale, and inference-time compute jointly influence retrieval performance. To address the lack of suitable metrics, we propose a novel evaluation measure inspired by contrastive entropy and generation loss, providing a continuous performance signal that enables robust comparisons across diverse generative retrieval methods. Our experiments show that n-gram-based methods demonstrate strong alignment with both training and inference scaling laws, especially when paired with larger LLMs. Furthermore, increasing inference computation yields substantial performance gains, revealing that generative retrieval can significantly benefit from higher compute budgets at inference. Across these settings, LLaMA models consistently outperform T5 models, suggesting a particular advantage for larger decoder-only models in generative retrieval. Taken together, our findings underscore that model sizes, data availability, and inference computation interact to unlock the full potential of generative retrieval, offering new insights for designing and optimizing future systems.|Hongru Cai et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18941)|null|

In this paper, we continually pre-train prevailing VFMs in a multimodal manner such that they can effortlessly process visual inputs of varying sizes and produce visual representations that are more aligned with language representations, regardless of their original pre-training process. To this end, we introduce CoMP, a carefully designed multimodal pre-training pipeline. CoMP uses a Continual Rotary Position Embedding to support native resolution continual pre-training, and an Alignment Loss between visual and textual features through language prototypes to align multimodal representations. By three-stage training, our VFMs achieve remarkable improvements not only in multimodal understanding but also in other downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation. Remarkably, CoMP-SigLIP achieves scores of 66.7 on ChartQA and 75.9 on DocVQA with a 0.5B LLM, while maintaining an 87.4% accuracy on ImageNet-1K and a 49.5 mIoU on ADE20K under frozen chunk evaluation.|Yitong Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18931)|**[link](https://github.com/SliMM-X/CoMP-MM)**|

However, existing on-policy algorithms used for post-training are inherently incompatible with the use of experience replay buffers, which can be populated scalably by distributed off-policy actors to enhance exploration as compute increases. We propose efficiently obtaining this benefit of replay buffers via Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony (TBA), a massively scalable LLM RL system. In contrast to existing approaches, TBA uses a larger fraction of compute on search, constantly generating off-policy data for a central replay buffer. A training node simultaneously samples data from this buffer based on reward or recency to update the policy using Trajectory Balance (TB), a diversity-seeking RL objective introduced for GFlowNets. TBA offers three key advantages: (1) decoupled training and search, speeding up training wall-clock time by 4x or more; (2) improved diversity through large-scale off-policy sampling; and (3) scalable search for sparse reward settings. On mathematical reasoning, preference-tuning, and automated red-teaming (diverse and representative post-training tasks), TBA produces speed and performance improvements over strong baselines.|Brian R.

To address this gap, we introduce Video SimpleQA, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for factuality evaluation of LVLMs. Our work distinguishes from existing video benchmarks through the following key features: 1) Knowledge required: demanding integration of external knowledge beyond the explicit narrative; 2) Fact-seeking question: targeting objective, undisputed events or relationships, avoiding subjective interpretation; 3) Definitive & short-form answer: Answers are crafted as unambiguous and definitively correct in a short format, enabling automated evaluation through LLM-as-a-judge frameworks with minimal scoring variance; 4) External-source verified: All annotations undergo rigorous validation against authoritative external references to ensure the reliability; 5) Temporal reasoning required: The annotated question types encompass both static single-frame understanding and dynamic temporal reasoning, explicitly evaluating LVLMs factuality under the long-context dependencies. We extensively evaluate 41 state-of-the-art LVLMs and summarize key findings as follows: 1) Current LVLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in factual adherence, particularly for open-source models. The best-performing model Gemini-1.5-Pro achieves merely an F-score of 54.4%; 2) Test-time compute paradigms show insignificant performance gains, revealing fundamental constraints for enhancing factuality through post-hoc computation; 3) Retrieval-Augmented Generation demonstrates consistent improvements at the cost of additional inference time overhead, presenting a critical efficiency-performance trade-off.|Meng Cao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18923)|null|
|**2025-03-24**|**FFN Fusion: Rethinking Sequential Computation in Large Language Models**|We introduce FFN Fusion, an architectural optimization technique that reduces sequential computation in large language models by identifying and exploiting natural opportunities for parallelization. Our key insight is that sequences of Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers, particularly those remaining after the removal of specific attention layers, can often be parallelized with minimal accuracy impact. We develop a principled methodology for identifying and fusing such sequences, transforming them into parallel operations that significantly reduce inference latency while preserving model behavior. Applying these techniques to Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct, we create Llama-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-Base (Ultra-253B-Base), an efficient and soon-to-be publicly available model that achieves a 1.71X speedup in inference latency and 35X lower per-token cost while maintaining strong performance across benchmarks. Through extensive experiments on models from 49B to 253B parameters, we demonstrate that FFN Fusion becomes increasingly effective at larger scales and can complement existing optimization techniques like quantization and pruning. Most intriguingly, we find that even full transformer blocks containing both attention and FFN layers can sometimes be parallelized, suggesting new directions for neural architecture design.|Akhiad Bercovich et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18908)|null|
|**2025-03-24**|**xKV: Cross-Layer SVD for KV-Cache Compression**|Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context windows enable powerful applications but come at the cost of high memory consumption to store the Key and Value states (KV-Cache). Recent studies attempted to merge KV-cache from multiple layers into shared representations, yet these approaches either require expensive pretraining or rely on assumptions of high per-token cosine similarity across layers which generally does not hold in practice. We find that the dominant singular vectors are remarkably well-aligned across multiple layers of the KV-Cache. Exploiting this insight, we propose xKV, a simple post-training method that applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the KV-Cache of grouped layers. xKV consolidates the KV-Cache of multiple layers into a shared low-rank subspace, significantly reducing KV-Cache sizes. Through extensive evaluations on the RULER long-context benchmark with widely-used LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.1 and Qwen2.5), xKV achieves up to 6.8x higher compression rates than state-of-the-art inter-layer technique while improving accuracy by 2.7%. Moreover, xKV is compatible with the emerging Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) (e.g., DeepSeek-Coder-V2), yielding a notable 3x compression rates on coding tasks without performance degradation. These results highlight xKV's strong capability and versatility in addressing memory bottlenecks for long-context LLM inference.

However, they still face substantial challenges of low communication efficiency and suboptimal task performance, making the careful design of the agents' communication topologies particularly important. Inspired by the management theory that roles in an efficient team are often dynamically adjusted, we propose AgentDropout, which identifies redundant agents and communication across different communication rounds by optimizing the adjacency matrices of the communication graphs and eliminates them to enhance both token efficiency and task performance. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, AgentDropout achieves an average reduction of 21.6% in prompt token consumption and 18.4% in completion token consumption, along with a performance improvement of 1.14 on the tasks. Furthermore, the extended experiments demonstrate that AgentDropout achieves notable domain transferability and structure robustness, revealing its reliability and effectiveness.

In response to this demand, this review first examines the evolving requirements for geocoding inputs and outputs across various scenarios these systems must address. It then provides a detailed analysis of how to construct such systems by breaking them down into key functional components and reviewing a broad spectrum of existing approaches, from traditional rule-based methods to advanced techniques in information retrieval, natural language processing, and large language models.

|**2025-03-21**|**Dancing with Critiques: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Stepwise Natural Language Self-Critique**|Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for complex tasks requiring multi-step logical deductions, remains a significant challenge. Traditional inference time scaling methods utilize scalar reward signals from process reward models to evaluate candidate reasoning steps, but these scalar rewards lack the nuanced qualitative information essential for understanding and justifying each step. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time scaling approach -- stepwise natural language self-critique (PANEL), which employs self-generated natural language critiques as feedback to guide the step-level search process. By generating rich, human-readable critiques for each candidate reasoning step, PANEL retains essential qualitative information, facilitating better-informed decision-making during inference. This approach bypasses the need for task-specific verifiers and the associated training overhead, making it broadly applicable across diverse tasks. Experimental results on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including AIME and GPQA, demonstrate that PANEL significantly enhances reasoning performance, outperforming traditional scalar reward-based methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/puddingyeah/PANEL to support and encourage future research in this promising field.|Yansi Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17363)|null|

Motivated by these findings, our study investigates whether similar reasoning capabilities can be successfully integrated into large vision-language models (LVLMs) and assesses their impact on challenging multimodal reasoning tasks. We consider an approach that iteratively leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on lightweight training data and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to further improve model generalization. Initially, reasoning capabilities were distilled from pure-text R1 models by generating reasoning steps using high-quality captions of the images sourced from diverse visual datasets. Subsequently, iterative RL training further enhance reasoning skills, with each iteration's RL-improved model generating refined SFT datasets for the next round. This iterative process yielded OpenVLThinker, a LVLM exhibiting consistently improved reasoning performance on challenging benchmarks such as MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision, demonstrating the potential of our strategy for robust vision-language reasoning.

|**2025-03-21**|**Capturing Individual Human Preferences with Reward Features**|Reinforcement learning from human feedback usually models preferences using a reward model that does not distinguish between people. We argue that this is unlikely to be a good design choice in contexts with high potential for disagreement, like in the training of large language models. We propose a method to specialise a reward model to a person or group of people. Our approach builds on the observation that individual preferences can be captured as a linear combination of a set of general reward features. We show how to learn such features and subsequently use them to quickly adapt the reward model to a specific individual, even if their preferences are not reflected in the training data. We present experiments with large language models comparing the proposed architecture with a non-adaptive reward model and also adaptive counterparts, including models that do in-context personalisation. Depending on how much disagreement there is in the training data, our model either significantly outperforms the baselines or matches their performance with a simpler architecture and more stable training.|André Barreto et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17338)|null|
|**2025-03-21**|**Efficient Intent-Based Filtering for Multi-Party Conversations Using Knowledge Distillation from LLMs**|Large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in conversational AI, enabling open-domain responses in chat-bots, as well as advanced processing of conversations like summarization, intent classification, and insights generation. However, these models are resource-intensive, demanding substantial memory and computational power. To address this, we propose a cost-effective solution that filters conversational snippets of interest for LLM processing, tailored to the target downstream application, rather than processing every snippet. In this work, we introduce an innovative approach that leverages knowledge distillation from LLMs to develop an intent-based filter for multi-party conversations, optimized for compute power constrained environments. Our method combines different strategies to create a diverse multi-party conversational dataset, that is annotated with the target intents and is then used to fine-tune the MobileBERT model for multi-label intent classification. This model achieves a balance between efficiency and performance, effectively filtering conversation snippets based on their intents. By passing only the relevant snippets to the LLM for further processing, our approach significantly reduces overall operational costs depending on the intents and the data distribution as demonstrated in our experiments.|Reem Gody et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17336)|null|

This growing risk highlights the urgent need for a real-world benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLM agents to exploit web application vulnerabilities. However, existing benchmarks fall short as they are limited to abstracted Capture the Flag competitions or lack comprehensive coverage. Building a benchmark for real-world vulnerabilities involves both specialized expertise to reproduce exploits and a systematic approach to evaluating unpredictable threats. To address this challenge, we introduce CVE-Bench, a real-world cybersecurity benchmark based on critical-severity Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. In CVE-Bench, we design a sandbox framework that enables LLM agents to exploit vulnerable web applications in scenarios that mimic real-world conditions, while also providing effective evaluation of their exploits. Our evaluation shows that the state-of-the-art agent framework can resolve up to 13% of vulnerabilities.|Yuxuan Zhu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17332)|**[link](https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/cve-bench)**|

Existing works predominantly focus on attaining human-level manipulation skills for robotic hands, yet little attention has been paid to task planning on long-horizon timescales. With their outstanding in-context learning and zero-shot generation abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied and grounded in diverse robotic embodiments to facilitate task planning. However, LLMs still suffer from errors in long-horizon reasoning and from hallucinations in complex robotic tasks, lacking a guarantee of logical correctness when generating the plan. Previous works, such as LLM+P, extended LLMs with symbolic planners. However, none have been successfully applied to bimanual robots. New challenges inevitably arise in bimanual manipulation, necessitating not only effective task decomposition but also efficient task allocation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LLM+MAP, a bimanual planning framework that integrates LLM reasoning and multi-agent planning, automating effective and efficient bimanual task planning. We conduct simulated experiments on various long-horizon manipulation tasks of differing complexity. Our method is built using GPT-4o as the backend, and we compare its performance against plans generated directly by LLMs, including GPT-4o, V3 and also recent strong reasoning models o1 and R1. By analyzing metrics such as planning time, success rate, group debits, and planning-step reduction rate, we demonstrate the superior performance of LLM+MAP, while also providing insights into robotic reasoning.

Traditional manual code audits are often expensive, time-intensive, and ill-suited for fast-paced workflows, while automated tools frequently suffer from high false-positive rates, limiting their reliability. To address these issues, we introduce Bugdar, an AI-augmented code review system that integrates seamlessly into GitHub pull requests, providing near real-time, context-aware vulnerability analysis. Bugdar leverages fine-tunable Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAGs) to deliver project-specific, actionable feedback that aligns with each codebase's unique requirements and developer practices. Supporting multiple programming languages, including Solidity, Move, Rust, and Python, Bugdar demonstrates exceptional efficiency, processing an average of 56.4 seconds per pull request or 30 lines of code per second. This is significantly faster than manual reviews, which could take hours per pull request. By facilitating a proactive approach to secure coding, Bugdar reduces the reliance on manual reviews, accelerates development cycles, and enhances the security posture of software systems without compromising productivity.|John Naulty et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17302)|null|
|**2025-03-21**|**CASE -- Condition-Aware Sentence Embeddings for Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity Measurement**|The meaning conveyed by a sentence often depends on the context in which it appears. Despite the progress of sentence embedding methods, it remains unclear how to best modify a sentence embedding conditioned on its context. To address this problem, we propose Condition-Aware Sentence Embeddings (CASE), an efficient and accurate method to create an embedding for a sentence under a given condition. First, CASE creates an embedding for the condition using a Large Language Model (LLM), where the sentence influences the attention scores computed for the tokens in the condition during pooling. Next, a supervised nonlinear projection is learned to reduce the dimensionality of the LLM-based text embeddings. We show that CASE significantly outperforms previously proposed Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) methods on an existing standard benchmark dataset. We find that subtracting the condition embedding consistently improves the C-STS performance of LLM-based text embeddings. Moreover, we propose a supervised dimensionality reduction method that not only reduces the dimensionality of LLM-based embeddings but also significantly improves their performance.|Gaifan Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17279)|null|

We address this challenge by proposing SafeMERGE, a post-fine-tuning framework that preserves safety while maintaining task utility. It achieves this by selectively merging fine-tuned and safety-aligned model layers only when those deviate from safe behavior, measured by a cosine similarity criterion. We evaluate SafeMERGE against other fine-tuning- and post-fine-tuning-stage approaches for Llama-2-7B-Chat and Qwen-2-7B-Instruct models on GSM8K and PubMedQA tasks while exploring different merging strategies. We find that SafeMERGE consistently reduces harmful outputs compared to other baselines without significantly sacrificing performance, sometimes even enhancing it. The results suggest that our selective, subspace-guided, and per-layer merging method provides an effective safeguard against the inadvertent loss of safety in fine-tuned LLMs while outperforming simpler post-fine-tuning-stage defenses.|Aladin Djuhera et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17239)|null|

While existing hallucination detection methods typically operate at the sentence level or passage level, we propose FactSelfCheck, a novel black-box sampling-based method that enables fine-grained fact-level detection. Our approach represents text as knowledge graphs consisting of facts in the form of triples. Through analyzing factual consistency across multiple LLM responses, we compute fine-grained hallucination scores without requiring external resources or training data. Our evaluation demonstrates that FactSelfCheck performs competitively with leading sampling-based methods while providing more detailed insights. Most notably, our fact-level approach significantly improves hallucination correction, achieving a 35% increase in factual content compared to the baseline, while sentence-level SelfCheckGPT yields only an 8% improvement. The granular nature of our detection enables more precise identification and correction of hallucinated content.|Albert Sawczyn et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17229)|null|

Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2 reasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences improve performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due to verbose and redundant outputs, known as the "overthinking phenomenon". In this paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically investigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient reasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we categorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based efficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models into more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning models; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to dynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input prompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency based on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control. Additionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning models, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and discuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.|Yang Sui et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16419)|null|

By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques with foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering feature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of knowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works on feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional features for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss between distilled features and foundation model features. To address these challenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and Gaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To validate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature similarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to highlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention. Our approach encompasses a diverse range of foundation models, including vision-language models (VLMs), perception models, and large multimodal and language models (LMMs/LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate real-world applicability, we deploy M3's feature field in indoor scenes on a quadruped robot.

A Rigorous Examination of Mitigation Strategies for LLM Benchmark Data Contamination**|Benchmark Data Contamination (BDC)-the inclusion of benchmark testing samples in the training set-has raised increasing concerns in Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation, leading to falsely inflated performance estimates and undermining evaluation reliability. To address this, researchers have proposed various mitigation strategies to update existing benchmarks, including modifying original questions or generating new ones based on them. However, a rigorous examination of the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies remains lacking. In this paper, we design a systematic and controlled pipeline along with two novel metrics-fidelity and contamination resistance-to provide a fine-grained and comprehensive assessment of existing BDC mitigation strategies. Previous assessment methods, such as accuracy drop and accuracy matching, focus solely on aggregate accuracy, often leading to incomplete or misleading conclusions. Our metrics address this limitation by emphasizing question-level evaluation result matching. Extensive experiments with 10 LLMs, 5 benchmarks, 20 BDC mitigation strategies, and 2 contamination scenarios reveal that no existing strategy significantly improves resistance over the vanilla case (i.e., no benchmark update) across all benchmarks, and none effectively balances fidelity and contamination resistance. These findings underscore the urgent need for designing more effective BDC mitigation strategies.

To answer this question, we propose a novel experimental approach, Misleading Fine-Tuning (MisFT), to examine whether LLMs/VLMs perform abstract reasoning by altering their original understanding of fundamental rules. In particular, by constructing a dataset with math expressions that contradict correct operation principles, we fine-tune the model to learn those contradictory rules and assess its generalization ability on different test domains. Through a series of experiments, we find that current LLMs/VLMs are capable of effectively applying contradictory rules to solve practical math word problems and math expressions represented by images, implying the presence of an internal mechanism that abstracts before reasoning.|Guanyu Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16401)|null|

The R1 distillation scheme has emerged as a promising approach for training cost-effective models with enhanced reasoning abilities. However, the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear. This study examines the universality of distillation data and identifies key components that enable the efficient transfer of long-chain reasoning capabilities in LLM distillation. Our findings reveal that the effectiveness of long CoT reasoning distillation from teacher models like Qwen-QwQ degrades significantly on nonhomologous models, challenging the assumed universality of current distillation methods. To gain deeper insights into the structure and patterns of long CoT reasoning, we propose DLCoT (Deconstructing Long Chain-of-Thought), a distillation data enhancement framework. DLCoT consists of three key steps: (1) data segmentation to decompose complex long CoT structures, (2) simplification by eliminating unsolvable and redundant solutions, and (3) optimization of intermediate error states.

While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they struggle to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that depend on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we observe that current layer-localized KE approaches, such as MEMIT and WISE, which edit only single or a few model layers, struggle to effectively incorporate updated information into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we propose CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enables more effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. CaKE leverages strategically curated data, guided by our circuits-based analysis, that enforces the model to utilize the modified knowledge, stimulating the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly integrated knowledge. Experimental results show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of updated knowledge across related reasoning tasks, leading to an average of 20% improvement in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on MQuAKE dataset compared to existing KE methods.

In light of this, we hypothesize that model performance and behaviors can be further enhanced and controlled by modulating the contributions of these sub-updates based on their relevance to the input or target output style, and propose LLMBRACES, a novel and efficient method that computes relevance scores associated with value vectors in FFN layers and leverages these scores to dynamically adjust the contribution of sub-updates. By optimizing sub-update contributions, LLMBRACES refines the prediction process, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs, much like a 'brace' providing support and stability. Moreover, LLMBRACES can be extended to support conditional control over generation characteristics, such as sentiment, thereby offering fine-grained steering of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments on various LLMs-including Qwen2.5-1.5B, Llama2-7B, and Llama3-8B-demonstrate that LLMBRACES outperforms baseline approaches in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings while requiring significantly fewer tunable parameters, up to 75% fewer compared to LoRA.

This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for scalable personalized alignment of LLMs. We establish a systematic preference space characterizing psychological and behavioral dimensions, alongside diverse persona representations for robust preference inference in real-world scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we introduce \textsc{AlignX}, a large-scale dataset of over 1.3 million personalized preference examples, and develop two complementary alignment approaches: \textit{in-context alignment} directly conditioning on persona representations and \textit{preference-bridged alignment} modeling intermediate preference distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over existing methods, with an average 17.06\% accuracy gain across four benchmarks while exhibiting a strong adaptation capability to novel preferences, robustness to limited user data, and precise preference controllability.

We systematically evaluate biases in RAG-based LLM by examining demographic-sensitive queries and measuring retrieval discrepancies. Using datasets like MMLU and MedMCQA, we analyze retrieval overlap and correctness disparities.

|**2025-03-19**|**SkyLadder: Better and Faster Pretraining via Context Window Scheduling**|Recent advancements in LLM pretraining have featured ever-expanding context windows to process longer sequences. However, our pilot study reveals that models pretrained with shorter context windows consistently outperform their long-context counterparts under a fixed token budget. This finding motivates us to explore an optimal context window scheduling strategy to better balance long-context capability with pretraining efficiency. To this end, we propose SkyLadder, a simple yet effective approach that implements a short-to-long context window transition. SkyLadder preserves strong standard benchmark performance, while matching or exceeding baseline results on long context tasks. Through extensive experiments, we pre-train 1B-parameter models (up to 32K context) and 3B-parameter models (8K context) on 100B tokens, demonstrating that SkyLadder yields consistent gains of up to 3.7% on common benchmarks, while achieving up to 22% faster training speeds compared to baselines.

|**2025-03-19**|**Visual Position Prompt for MLLM based Visual Grounding**|Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address this issue, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM equipped with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms. The global VPP overlays learnable, axis-like embeddings onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues. The local VPP focuses on fine-grained localization by incorporating position-aware queries, which suggests probable object locations. We also introduce a VPP-SFT dataset with 0.6M samples, consolidating high-quality visual grounding data into a compact format for efficient model training. Training on this dataset with VPP enhances the model's performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard grounding benchmarks despite using fewer training samples compared to other MLLMs like MiniGPT-v2, which rely on much larger datasets ( $\sim$ 21M samples). The code and VPP-SFT dataset will be available at https://github.com/WayneTomas/VPP-LLaVA upon acceptance.|Wei Tang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15426)|null|

|**2025-03-19**|**Real-world validation of a multimodal LLM-powered pipeline for High-Accuracy Clinical Trial Patient Matching leveraging EHR data**|Background: Patient recruitment in clinical trials is hindered by complex eligibility criteria and labor-intensive chart reviews. Prior research using text-only models have struggled to address this problem in a reliable and scalable way due to (1) limited reasoning capabilities, (2) information loss from converting visual records to text, and (3) lack of a generic EHR integration to extract patient data.   Methods: We introduce a broadly applicable, integration-free, LLM-powered pipeline that automates patient-trial matching using unprocessed documents extracted from EHRs. Our approach leverages (1) the new reasoning-LLM paradigm, enabling the assessment of even the most complex criteria, (2) visual capabilities of latest LLMs to interpret medical records without lossy image-to-text conversions, and (3) multimodal embeddings for efficient medical record search. The pipeline was validated on the n2c2 2018 cohort selection dataset (288 diabetic patients) and a real-world dataset composed of 485 patients from 30 different sites matched against 36 diverse trials.   Results: On the n2c2 dataset, our method achieved a new state-of-the-art criterion-level accuracy of 93\%. In real-world trials, the pipeline yielded an accuracy of 87\%, undermined by the difficulty to replicate human decision-making when medical records lack sufficient information. Nevertheless, users were able to review overall eligibility in under 9 minutes per patient on average, representing an 80\% improvement over traditional manual chart reviews.   Conclusion: This pipeline demonstrates robust performance in clinical trial patient matching without requiring custom integration with site systems or trial-specific tailoring, thereby enabling scalable deployment across sites seeking to leverage AI for patient matching.|Anatole Callies et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15374)|null|
|**2025-03-19**|**EfficientLLaVA:Generalizable Auto-Pruning for Large Vision-language Models**|While multimodal large language models demonstrate strong performance in complex reasoning tasks, they pose significant challenges related to model complexity during deployment, especially for resource-limited devices. In this paper, we propose an automatic pruning method for large vision-language models to enhance the efficiency of multimodal reasoning. Conventional methods rely on the training data of the original model to select the proper pruning ratio for different network components. However, these methods are impractical for large vision-language models due to the unaffordable search costs caused by web-scale training corpus. In contrast, our approach only leverages a small number of samples to search for the desired pruning policy by maximizing its generalization ability on unknown training data while maintaining the model accuracy, which enables the achievement of an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for large visual language models. Specifically, we formulate the generalization gap of the pruning strategy using the structural risk minimization principle. Based on both task performance and generalization capability, we iteratively search for the optimal pruning policy within a given search space and optimize the vision projector to evolve the search space with higher upper bound of performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the ScienceQA, Vizwiz, MM-vet, and LLaVA-Bench datasets for the task of visual question answering. Using only 64 samples for pruning policy search, EfficientLLaVA achieves an accuracy of 83.05% on ScienceQA, along with a $\times$ 1.8 speedup compared to the dense LLaVA-v1.5-7B model.|Yinan Liang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15369)|null|

Despite recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), idiomaticity remains a significant obstacle to robust semantic representation. We present datasets and tasks for SemEval-2025 Task 1: AdMiRe (Advancing Multimodal Idiomaticity Representation), which challenges the community to assess and improve models' ability to interpret idiomatic expressions in multimodal contexts and in multiple languages. Participants competed in two subtasks: ranking images based on their alignment with idiomatic or literal meanings, and predicting the next image in a sequence. The most effective methods achieved human-level performance by leveraging pretrained LLMs and vision-language models in mixture-of-experts settings, with multiple queries used to smooth over the weaknesses in these models' representations of idiomaticity.|Thomas Pickard et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15358)|null|

Rather than attempting to design and train a new multimodal audio-video model, we show how existing video diffusion models can be adapted to align with musical inputs by introducing lightweight music-video cross-attention and a low-rank adapter. Unlike prior work requiring motion capture data, our approach fine-tunes only on dance videos. MusicInfuser achieves high-quality music-driven video generation while preserving the flexibility and generative capabilities of the underlying models.

|**2025-03-18**|**Aligning Multimodal LLM with Human Preference: A Survey**|Large language models (LLMs) can handle a wide variety of general tasks with simple prompts, without the need for task-specific training. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built upon LLMs, have demonstrated impressive potential in tackling complex tasks involving visual, auditory, and textual data. However, critical issues related to truthfulness, safety, o1-like reasoning, and alignment with human preference remain insufficiently addressed. This gap has spurred the emergence of various alignment algorithms, each targeting different application scenarios and optimization goals. Recent studies have shown that alignment algorithms are a powerful approach to resolving the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of alignment algorithms for MLLMs. Specifically, we explore four key aspects: (1) the application scenarios covered by alignment algorithms, including general image understanding, multi-image, video, and audio, and extended multimodal applications; (2) the core factors in constructing alignment datasets, including data sources, model responses, and preference annotations; (3) the benchmarks used to evaluate alignment algorithms; and (4) a discussion of potential future directions for the development of alignment algorithms.

Empirical evaluations across diverse mathematical process error identification benchmarks (Mathcheck, ProcessBench, and PRM800K) show consistent performance improvements over baseline methods. When applied to the recent DeepSeek R1 distilled models, our method demonstrates strong performance, enabling 7B/8B distilled models to outperform all 70B/72B models and GPT-4o on ProcessBench.

|**2025-03-18**|**Engineering Scientific Assistants using Interactive Structured Induction of Programs**|We are interested in the construction of software that can act as scientific assistants to domain specialists. It is expected that such assistants will be needed to accelerate the identification of ways to address complex problems requiring urgent solutions. In this paper, our focus is not on a specific scientific problem, but on the software-engineering of such 'science accelerators'. Recent developments in 'No Code' techniques would seem to suggest that scientist can simply hypothesise solutions simply by conversing with a large language model (LLM). However, for complex scientific problems, this seems unlikely given the current state of LLM technology. What does appear feasible is that a software engineer can use LLMs to rapidly construct programs for use by a domain-specialist, including the specialist's requirements expressed in natural language. We propose the design of an interactive form of 'structured' inductive programming in which a software-engineer and an LLM collaboratively construct an 'assistant' for a scientific data analysis. The paper describes a simple implementation called iStrucInd that adapts a '2-way Intelligibility' protocol to implement the interaction between the software engineer and the LLM. We test the tool on two different non-trivial scientific data analysis tasks. Specifically, we compare the system constructed by iStrucInd against systems constructed manually and by Low Code/No Code methods along dimensions of: (a) program performance; (b) program quality; and (c) programming effort. The results show iStrucInd allows a software engineer to develop better programs faster suggesting interactive structured induction can play a useful role in the rapid construction of scientific assistants.|Shraddha Surana et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14488)|null|
|**2025-03-18**|**Gricean Norms as a Basis for Effective Collaboration**|Effective human-AI collaboration hinges not only on the AI agent's ability to follow explicit instructions but also on its capacity to navigate ambiguity, incompleteness, invalidity, and irrelevance in communication. Gricean conversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear instructions with cooperative principles. We propose a normative framework that integrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks -- common ground, relevance theory, and theory of mind -- into large language model (LLM) based agents. The normative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation, and manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear instructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant. Within this framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to collaborate with humans. To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI collaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one without. In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve shared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear and unclear natural language instructions. Our results reveal that the Lamoid with Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more accurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms. This improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's pragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling context-aware communication in LLM-based agents.|Fardin Saad et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14484)|null|

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for their creative capabilities, the assessment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Creation-MMBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the creative capabilities of MLLMs in real-world, image-based tasks. The benchmark comprises 765 test cases spanning 51 fine-grained tasks. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we define instance-specific evaluation criteria for each test case, guiding the assessment of both general response quality and factual consistency with visual inputs. Experimental results reveal that current open-source MLLMs significantly underperform compared to proprietary models in creative tasks. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that visual fine-tuning can negatively impact the base LLM's creative abilities. Creation-MMBench provides valuable insights for advancing MLLM creativity and establishes a foundation for future improvements in multimodal generative intelligence.

|**2025-03-18**|**Calibrating Verbal Uncertainty as a Linear Feature to Reduce Hallucinations**|LLMs often adopt an assertive language style also when making false claims. Such ``overconfident hallucinations'' mislead users and erode trust. Achieving the ability to express in language the actual degree of uncertainty around a claim is therefore of great importance. We find that ``verbal uncertainty'' is governed by a single linear feature in the representation space of LLMs, and show that this has only moderate correlation with the actual ``semantic uncertainty'' of the model. We apply this insight and show that (1) the mismatch between semantic and verbal uncertainty is a better predictor of hallucinations than semantic uncertainty alone and (2) we can intervene on verbal uncertainty at inference time and reduce hallucinations on short-form answers, achieving an average relative reduction of 32%.|Ziwei Ji et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14477)|null|

|**2025-03-18**|**EnvBench: A Benchmark for Automated Environment Setup**|Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled researchers to focus on practical repository-level tasks in software engineering domain. In this work, we consider a cornerstone task for automating work with software repositories-environment setup, i.e., a task of configuring a repository-specific development environment on a system. Existing studies on environment setup introduce innovative agentic strategies, but their evaluation is often based on small datasets that may not capture the full range of configuration challenges encountered in practice. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive environment setup benchmark EnvBench. It encompasses 329 Python and 665 JVM-based (Java, Kotlin) repositories, with a focus on repositories that present genuine configuration challenges, excluding projects that can be fully configured by simple deterministic scripts. To enable further benchmark extension and usage for model tuning, we implement two automatic metrics: a static analysis check for missing imports in Python and a compilation check for JVM languages. We demonstrate the applicability of our benchmark by evaluating three environment setup approaches, including a simple zero-shot baseline and two agentic workflows, that we test with two powerful LLM backbones, GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. The best approach manages to successfully configure 6.69% repositories for Python and 29.47% repositories for JVM, suggesting that EnvBench remains challenging for current approaches.

|**2025-03-18**|**LLM-FE: Automated Feature Engineering for Tabular Data with LLMs as Evolutionary Optimizers**|Automated feature engineering plays a critical role in improving predictive model performance for tabular learning tasks. Traditional automated feature engineering methods are limited by their reliance on pre-defined transformations within fixed, manually designed search spaces, often neglecting domain knowledge. Recent advances using Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the integration of domain knowledge into the feature engineering process. However, existing LLM-based approaches use direct prompting or rely solely on validation scores for feature selection, failing to leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments or establish meaningful reasoning between feature generation and data-driven performance. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-FE, a novel framework that combines evolutionary search with the domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automatically discover effective features for tabular learning tasks. LLM-FE formulates feature engineering as a program search problem, where LLMs propose new feature transformation programs iteratively, and data-driven feedback guides the search process. Our results demonstrate that LLM-FE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular prediction models across diverse classification and regression benchmarks.|Nikhil Abhyankar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14434)|null|
|**2025-03-17**|**MetaScale: Test-Time Scaling with Evolving Meta-Thoughts**|One critical challenge for large language models (LLMs) for making complex reasoning is their reliance on matching reasoning patterns from training data, instead of proactively selecting the most appropriate cognitive strategy to solve a given task. Existing approaches impose fixed cognitive structures that enhance performance in specific tasks but lack adaptability across diverse scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce METASCALE, a test-time scaling framework based on meta-thoughts -- adaptive thinking strategies tailored to each task. METASCALE initializes a pool of candidate meta-thoughts, then iteratively selects and evaluates them using a multi-armed bandit algorithm with upper confidence bound selection, guided by a reward model. To further enhance adaptability, a genetic algorithm evolves high-reward meta-thoughts, refining and extending the strategy pool over time. By dynamically proposing and optimizing meta-thoughts at inference time, METASCALE improves both accuracy and generalization across a wide range of tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaScale consistently outperforms standard inference approaches, achieving an 11% performance gain in win rate on Arena-Hard for GPT-4o, surpassing o1-mini by 0.9% under style control. Notably, METASCALE scales more effectively with increasing sampling budgets and produces more structured, expert-level responses.|Qin Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13447)|null|

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive counterfactual faithfulness analysis across 62 models from 8 families, encompassing both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants and significantly extending prior studies of counterfactual tests. We introduce phi-CCT, a simplified variant of the Correlational Counterfactual Test, which avoids the need for token probabilities while explaining most of the variance of the original test. Our findings reveal clear scaling trends: larger models are consistently more faithful on our metrics. However, when comparing instruction-tuned and human-imitated explanations, we find that observed differences in faithfulness can often be attributed to explanation verbosity, leading to shifts along the true-positive/false-positive Pareto frontier. While instruction-tuning and prompting can influence this trade-off, we find limited evidence that they fundamentally expand the frontier of explanatory faithfulness beyond what is achievable with pretrained models of comparable size. Our analysis highlights the nuanced relationship between instruction-tuning, verbosity, and the faithful representation of model decision processes.|Noah Y.

Therefore, inference speed is one of the most critical properties of LLM architectures, and there is a growing need for LLMs that are efficient and fast at inference. Recently, LLMs built on the xLSTM architecture have emerged as a powerful alternative to Transformers, offering linear compute scaling with sequence length and constant memory usage, both highly desirable properties for efficient inference.

Multi-agent cooperative decision-making involves multiple agents working together to complete established tasks and achieve specific objectives. These techniques are widely applicable in real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving, drone navigation, disaster rescue, and simulated military confrontations.

This paper introduces an innovative approach\footnote{A lightweight, mock version of the code is available on GitHub at that combines a multi-agent framework with the Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) to automate and optimize the generation, debugging, execution, and analysis of complex 5G network scenarios. Our framework orchestrates a suite of specialized agents -- namely, the Simulation Generation Agent, Test Designer Agent, Test Executor Agent, and Result Interpretation Agent -- using advanced LangChain coordination. The Simulation Generation Agent employs a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process, leveraging LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to translate natural language simulation specifications into precise ns-3 scripts.

Recognizing this problem as analogous to the historical difficulties in understanding the human mind, we argue that methods developed in cognitive science can be useful for understanding large language models. We propose a framework for applying these methods based on Marr's three levels of analysis. By revisiting established cognitive science techniques relevant to each level and illustrating their potential to yield insights into the behavior and internal organization of large language models, we aim to provide a toolkit for making sense of these new kinds of minds.|Alexander Ku et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13401)|null|
|**2025-03-17**|**MicroVQA: A Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark for Microscopy-Based Scientific Research**|Scientific research demands sophisticated reasoning over multimodal data, a challenge especially prevalent in biology. Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AI-assisted research, existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks only target up to college-level difficulty, while research-level benchmarks emphasize lower-level perception, falling short of the complex multimodal reasoning needed for scientific discovery. To bridge this gap, we introduce MicroVQA, a visual-question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to assess three reasoning capabilities vital in research workflows: expert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal. MicroVQA consists of 1,042 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) curated by biology experts across diverse microscopy modalities, ensuring VQA samples represent real scientific practice. In constructing the benchmark, we find that standard MCQ generation methods induce language shortcuts, motivating a new two-stage pipeline: an optimized LLM prompt structures question-answer pairs into MCQs; then, an agent-based `RefineBot' updates them to remove shortcuts. Benchmarking on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a peak performance of 53\%; models with smaller LLMs only slightly underperform top models, suggesting that language-based reasoning is less challenging than multimodal reasoning; and tuning with scientific articles enhances performance. Expert analysis of chain-of-thought responses shows that perception errors are the most frequent, followed by knowledge errors and then overgeneralization errors. These insights highlight the challenges in multimodal scientific reasoning, showing MicroVQA is a valuable resource advancing AI-driven biomedical research.

|**2025-03-14**|**ASMA-Tune: Unlocking LLMs' Assembly Code Comprehension via Structural-Semantic Instruction Tuning**|Analysis and comprehension of assembly code are crucial in various applications, such as reverse engineering. However, the low information density and lack of explicit syntactic structures in assembly code pose significant challenges. Pioneering approaches with masked language modeling (MLM)-based methods have been limited by facilitating natural language interaction. While recent methods based on decoder-focused large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced semantic representation, they still struggle to capture the nuanced and sparse semantics in assembly code. In this paper, we propose Assembly Augmented Tuning (ASMA-Tune), an end-to-end structural-semantic instruction-tuning framework. Our approach synergizes encoder architectures with decoder-based LLMs through projector modules to enable comprehensive code understanding. Experiments show that ASMA-Tune outperforms existing benchmarks, significantly enhancing assembly code comprehension and instruction-following abilities.

|**2025-03-14**|**Neutralizing Bias in LLM Reasoning using Entailment Graphs**|LLMs are often claimed to be capable of Natural Language Inference (NLI), which is widely regarded as a cornerstone of more complex forms of reasoning. However, recent works show that LLMs still suffer from hallucinations in NLI due to attestation bias, where LLMs overly rely on propositional memory to build shortcuts. To solve the issue, we design an unsupervised framework to construct counterfactual reasoning data and fine-tune LLMs to reduce attestation bias. To measure bias reduction, we build bias-adversarial variants of NLI datasets with randomly replaced predicates in premises while keeping hypotheses unchanged. Extensive evaluations show that our framework can significantly reduce hallucinations from attestation bias. Then, we further evaluate LLMs fine-tuned with our framework on original NLI datasets and their bias-neutralized versions, where original entities are replaced with randomly sampled ones. Extensive results show that our framework consistently improves inferential performance on both original and bias-neutralized NLI datasets.|Liang Cheng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11614)|null|
|**2025-03-14**|**Broaden your SCOPE! Efficient Multi-turn Conversation Planning for LLMs using Semantic Space**|Large language models (LLMs) are used in chatbots or AI assistants to hold conversations with a human user. In such applications, the quality (e.g., user engagement, safety) of a conversation is important and can only be exactly known at the end of the conversation. To maximize its expected quality, conversation planning reasons about the stochastic transitions within a conversation to select the optimal LLM response at each turn. Existing simulation-based conversation planning algorithms typically select the optimal response by simulating future conversations with a large number of LLM queries at every turn. However, this process is extremely time-consuming and hence impractical for real-time conversations. This paper presents a novel approach called Semantic space COnversation Planning with improved Efficiency (SCOPE) that exploits the dense semantic representation of conversations to perform conversation planning efficiently. In particular, SCOPE models the stochastic transitions in conversation semantics and their associated rewards to plan entirely within the semantic space. This allows us to select the optimal LLM response at every conversation turn without needing additional LLM queries for simulation. As a result, SCOPE can perform conversation planning 70 times faster than conventional simulation-based planning algorithms when applied to a wide variety of conversation starters and two reward functions seen in the real world, yet achieving a higher reward within a practical planning budget.

While policies are written in convenient languages, such as AWS Identity and Access Management Policy Language, manually written policies often become complex and error prone. In this paper, we investigate whether and how well Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to synthesize access control policies. Our investigation focuses on the task of taking an access control request specification and zero-shot prompting LLMs to synthesize a well-formed access control policy which correctly adheres to the request specification. We consider two scenarios, one which the request specification is given as a concrete list of requests to be allowed or denied, and another in which a natural language description is used to specify sets of requests to be allowed or denied. We then argue that for zero-shot prompting, more precise and structured prompts using a syntax based approach are necessary and experimentally show preliminary results validating our approach.|Adarsh Vatsa et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11573)|null|
|**2025-03-14**|**Implicit Bias-Like Patterns in Reasoning Models**|Implicit bias refers to automatic or spontaneous mental processes that shape perceptions, judgments, and behaviors. Previous research examining `implicit bias' in large language models (LLMs) has often approached the phenomenon differently than how it is studied in humans by focusing primarily on model outputs rather than on model processing. To examine model processing, we present a method called the Reasoning Model Implicit Association Test (RM-IAT) for studying implicit bias-like patterns in reasoning models: LLMs that employ step-by-step reasoning to solve complex tasks. Using this method, we find that reasoning models require more tokens when processing association-incompatible information compared to association-compatible information. These findings suggest AI systems harbor patterns in processing information that are analogous to human implicit bias. We consider the implications of these implicit bias-like patterns for their deployment in real-world applications.|Messi H. J. Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11572)|null|
|**2025-03-14**|**VERIFY: A Benchmark of Visual Explanation and Reasoning for Investigating Multimodal Reasoning Fidelity**|Visual reasoning is central to human cognition, enabling individuals to interpret and abstractly understand their environment. Although recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across language and vision-language tasks, existing benchmarks primarily measure recognition-based skills and inadequately assess true visual reasoning capabilities. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce VERIFY, a benchmark explicitly designed to isolate and rigorously evaluate the visual reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs. VERIFY compels models to reason primarily from visual information, providing minimal textual context to reduce reliance on domain-specific knowledge and linguistic biases. Each problem is accompanied by a human-annotated reasoning path, making it the first to provide in-depth evaluation of model decision-making processes. Additionally, we propose novel metrics that assess visual reasoning fidelity beyond mere accuracy, highlighting critical imbalances in current model reasoning patterns. Our comprehensive benchmarking of leading MLLMs uncovers significant limitations, underscoring the need for a balanced and holistic approach to both perception and reasoning.

|**2025-03-14**|**Similarity-Aware Token Pruning: Your VLM but Faster**|The computational demands of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain a significant challenge due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. While token pruning offers a promising solution, existing methods often introduce training overhead or fail to adapt dynamically across layers. We present SAINT, a training-free token pruning framework that leverages token similarity and a graph-based formulation to dynamically optimize pruning rates and redundancy thresholds. Through systematic analysis, we identify a universal three-stage token evolution process (aligner-explorer-aggregator) in transformers, enabling aggressive pruning in early stages without sacrificing critical information. For ViTs, SAINT doubles the throughput of ViT-H/14 at 224px with only 0.6% accuracy loss on ImageNet-1K, surpassing the closest competitor by 0.8%. For VLMs, we apply SAINT in three modes: ViT-only, LLM-only, and hybrid. SAINT reduces LLaVA-13B's tokens by 75%, achieving latency comparable to LLaVA-7B with less than 1% performance loss across benchmarks. Our work establishes a unified, practical framework for efficient inference in ViTs and VLMs.|Ahmadreza Jeddi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11549)|null|
|**2025-03-14**|**Potential of large language model-powered nudges for promoting daily water and energy conservation**|The increasing amount of pressure related to water and energy shortages has increased the urgency of cultivating individual conservation behaviors. While the concept of nudging, i.e., providing usage-based feedback, has shown promise in encouraging conservation behaviors, its efficacy is often constrained by the lack of targeted and actionable content. This study investigates the impact of the use of large language models (LLMs) to provide tailored conservation suggestions for conservation intentions and their rationale. Through a survey experiment with 1,515 university participants, we compare three virtual nudging scenarios: no nudging, traditional nudging with usage statistics, and LLM-powered nudging with usage statistics and personalized conservation suggestions. The results of statistical analyses and causal forest modeling reveal that nudging led to an increase in conservation intentions among 86.9%-98.0% of the participants. LLM-powered nudging achieved a maximum increase of 18.0% in conservation intentions, surpassing traditional nudging by 88.6%. Furthermore, structural equation modeling results reveal that exposure to LLM-powered nudges enhances self-efficacy and outcome expectations while diminishing dependence on social norms, thereby increasing intrinsic motivation to conserve. These findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in promoting individual water and energy conservation, representing a new frontier in the design of sustainable behavioral interventions and resource management.|Zonghan Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11531)|null|
|**2025-03-14**|**HiTVideo: Hierarchical Tokenizers for Enhancing Text-to-Video Generation with Autoregressive Large Language Models**|Text-to-video generation poses significant challenges due to the inherent complexity of video data, which spans both temporal and spatial dimensions. It introduces additional redundancy, abrupt variations, and a domain gap between language and vision tokens while generation. Addressing these challenges requires an effective video tokenizer that can efficiently encode video data while preserving essential semantic and spatiotemporal information, serving as a critical bridge between text and vision. Inspired by the observation in VQ-VAE-2 and workflows of traditional animation, we propose HiTVideo for text-to-video generation with hierarchical tokenizers. It utilizes a 3D causal VAE with a multi-layer discrete token framework, encoding video content into hierarchically structured codebooks. Higher layers capture semantic information with higher compression, while lower layers focus on fine-grained spatiotemporal details, striking a balance between compression efficiency and reconstruction quality. Our approach efficiently encodes longer video sequences (e.g., 8 seconds, 64 frames), reducing bits per pixel (bpp) by approximately 70\% compared to baseline tokenizers, while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. We explore the trade-offs between compression and reconstruction, while emphasizing the advantages of high-compressed semantic tokens in text-to-video tasks. HiTVideo aims to address the potential limitations of existing video tokenizers in text-to-video generation tasks, striving for higher compression ratios and simplify LLMs modeling under language guidance, offering a scalable and promising framework for advancing text to video generation.

|**2025-03-14**|**V-STaR: Benchmarking Video-LLMs on Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning**|Human processes video reasoning in a sequential spatio-temporal reasoning logic, we first identify the relevant frames ("when") and then analyse the spatial relationships ("where") between key objects, and finally leverage these relationships to draw inferences ("what"). However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also "reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic" in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained "memory" of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition. Experiments from 14 Video-LLMs on our V-STaR reveal significant gaps between current Video-LLMs and the needs for robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning.|Zixu Cheng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11495)|null|
|**2025-03-13**|**GoT: Unleashing Reasoning Capability of Multimodal Large Language Model for Visual Generation and Editing**|Current image generation and editing methods primarily process textual prompts as direct inputs without reasoning about visual composition and explicit operations. We present Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT), a novel paradigm that enables generation and editing through an explicit language reasoning process before outputting images. This approach transforms conventional text-to-image generation and editing into a reasoning-guided framework that analyzes semantic relationships and spatial arrangements. We define the formulation of GoT and construct large-scale GoT datasets containing over 9M samples with detailed reasoning chains capturing semantic-spatial relationships. To leverage the advantages of GoT, we implement a unified framework that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for reasoning chain generation with an end-to-end diffusion model enhanced by our novel Semantic-Spatial Guidance Module. Experiments show our GoT framework achieves excellent performance on both generation and editing tasks, with significant improvements over baselines. Additionally, our approach enables interactive visual generation, allowing users to explicitly modify reasoning steps for precise image adjustments. GoT pioneers a new direction for reasoning-driven visual generation and editing, producing images that better align with human intent.

|**2025-03-13**|**HybridVLA: Collaborative Diffusion and Autoregression in a Unified Vision-Language-Action Model**|Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) for common-sense reasoning have led to the development of vision-language-action (VLA) models, enabling robots to perform generalized manipulation. Although existing autoregressive VLA methods leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they disrupt the continuity of actions. Meanwhile, some VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions, relying solely on VLM-extracted features, which limits their reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates the strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion policies within a single large language model, rather than simply connecting them. To bridge the generation gap, a collaborative training recipe is proposed that injects the diffusion modeling directly into the next-token prediction. With this recipe, we find that these two forms of action prediction not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying performance across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses these two predictions, leading to more robust control. In experiments, HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods across various simulation and real-world tasks, including both single-arm and dual-arm robots, while demonstrating stable manipulation in previously unseen configurations.|Jiaming Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10631)|null|
|**2025-03-13**|**UniGoal: Towards Universal Zero-shot Goal-oriented Navigation**|In this paper, we propose a general framework for universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation. Existing zero-shot methods build inference framework upon large language models (LLM) for specific tasks, which differs a lot in overall pipeline and fails to generalize across different types of goal. Towards the aim of universal zero-shot navigation, we propose a uniform graph representation to unify different goals, including object category, instance image and text description. We also convert the observation of agent into an online maintained scene graph. With this consistent scene and goal representation, we preserve most structural information compared with pure text and are able to leverage LLM for explicit graph-based reasoning. Specifically, we conduct graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph at each time instant and propose different strategies to generate long-term goal of exploration according to different matching states. The agent first iteratively searches subgraph of goal when zero-matched. With partial matching, the agent then utilizes coordinate projection and anchor pair alignment to infer the goal location. Finally scene graph correction and goal verification are applied for perfect matching. We also present a blacklist mechanism to enable robust switch between stages. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our UniGoal achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on three studied navigation tasks with a single model, even outperforming task-specific zero-shot methods and supervised universal methods.|Hang Yin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10630)|null|

In this work, we extend an existing LLM to the speech modality via speech discretization and continued pre-training. In particular, we are interested in multilingual LLMs, such as TOWER, as their pre-training setting allows us to treat discretized speech input as an additional translation language. The resulting open-source model, SPIRE, is able to transcribe and translate English speech input while maintaining TOWER's original performance on translation-related tasks, showcasing that discretized speech input integration as an additional language is feasible during LLM adaptation.

Unlike single-turn jailbreaks that rely on one meticulously engineered prompt, Siege expands the conversation at each turn in a breadth-first fashion, branching out multiple adversarial prompts that exploit partial compliance from previous responses. By tracking these incremental policy leaks and re-injecting them into subsequent queries, Siege reveals how minor concessions can accumulate into fully disallowed outputs. Evaluations on the JailbreakBench dataset show that Siege achieves a 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo and 97% on GPT-4 in a single multi-turn run, using fewer queries than baselines such as Crescendo or GOAT. This tree search methodology offers an in-depth view of how model safeguards degrade over successive dialogue turns, underscoring the urgency of robust multi-turn testing procedures for language models.|Andy Zhou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10619)|null|
|**2025-03-13**|**Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning for Adaptive Large Language Models**|Adapting large language models to multiple tasks can cause cross-skill interference, where improvements for one skill degrade another. While methods such as LoRA impose orthogonality constraints at the weight level, they do not fully address interference in hidden-state representations. We propose Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning (CS-ReFT), a novel representation-based approach that learns multiple orthonormal subspace transformations, each specializing in a distinct skill, and composes them via a lightweight router. By isolating these subspace edits in the hidden state, rather than weight matrices, CS-ReFT prevents cross-task conflicts more effectively. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, applying CS-ReFT to Llama-2-7B achieves a 93.94% win rate, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo (86.30%) while requiring only 0.0098% of model parameters. These findings show that specialized representation edits, composed via a simple router, significantly enhance multi-task instruction following with minimal overhead.|Andy Zhou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10617)|null|

However, multimodal reasoning, which requires integrating visual and textual information, remains a significant challenge. Existing visual-language models often struggle to effectively analyze and reason visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on complex reasoning tasks. Moreover, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks hinders the accurate assessment of multimodal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce R1-Onevision, a multimodal reasoning model designed to bridge the gap between visual perception and deep reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a cross-modal reasoning pipeline that transforms images into formal textural representations, enabling precise language-based reasoning. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct the R1-Onevision dataset which provides detailed, step-by-step multimodal reasoning annotations across diverse domains. We further develop the R1-Onevision model through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to cultivate advanced reasoning and robust generalization abilities. To comprehensively evaluate multimodal reasoning performance across different grades, we introduce R1-Onevision-Bench, a benchmark aligned with human educational stages, covering exams from junior high school to university and beyond.

We decompose such a task as an agentic workflow (path) of tool use that addresses a sequence of subtasks by AI tools of varying costs. Conventional search algorithms require expensive exploration to find tool paths. While large language models (LLMs) possess prior knowledge of subtask planning, they may lack accurate estimations of capabilities and costs of tools to determine which to apply in each subtask. Can we combine the strengths of both LLMs and graph search to find cost-efficient tool paths? We propose a three-stage approach "CoSTA*" that leverages LLMs to create a subtask tree, which helps prune a graph of AI tools for the given task, and then conducts A* search on the small subgraph to find a tool path. To better balance the total cost and quality, CoSTA* combines both metrics of each tool on every subtask to guide the A* search. Each subtask's output is then evaluated by a vision-language model (VLM), where a failure will trigger an update of the tool's cost and quality on the subtask. Hence, the A* search can recover from failures quickly to explore other paths. Moreover, CoSTA* can automatically switch between modalities across subtasks for a better cost-quality trade-off. We build a novel benchmark of challenging multi-turn image editing, on which CoSTA* outperforms state-of-the-art image-editing models or agents in terms of both cost and quality, and performs versatile trade-offs upon user preference.|Advait Gupta et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10613)|**[link](https://github.com/tianyi-lab/CoSTAR)**|

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that internal states, such as hidden states, encode the "overall truthfulness" of generated responses. However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs function and whether they could serve as "per-token" hallucination indicators, which is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and discover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token indicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode universal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating that there exist "generic truthful directions" shared by various LVLMs. Based on these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt) that first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies truthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further propose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination detection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent subspaces. We evaluate TruthPrInt in extensive experimental settings, including in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, over popular LVLMs and OH benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that TruthPrInt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

However, such promotion is extremely dependent on large-scale high-quality annotated data, which is costly and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose unlocking the value of abundant yet unlabeled data to improve the language-driving model in a semi-supervised learning manner. Specifically, we first introduce a series of template-based prompts to extract scene information, generating questions that create pseudo-answers for the unlabeled data based on a model trained with limited labeled data. Next, we propose a Self-Consistency Refinement method to improve the quality of these pseudo-annotations, which are later used for further training. By utilizing a pre-trained VisionLLM (e.g., InternVL), we build a strong Language Driving Model (LDM) for driving scene question-answering, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM benchmark show that our approach performs well with just 5% labeled data, achieving competitive performance against models trained with full datasets. In particular, our LDM achieves 44.85% performance with limited labeled data, increasing to 54.27% when using unlabeled data, while models trained with full datasets reach 60.68% on the DriveLM benchmark.|Chaoqun Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10586)|null|

This paper initially introduces a dual-metric evaluation method, comprising Boundary Clarity and Chunk Stickiness, to enable the direct quantification of chunking quality. Leveraging this assessment method, we highlight the inherent limitations of traditional and semantic chunking in handling complex contextual nuances, thereby substantiating the necessity of integrating LLMs into chunking process. To address the inherent trade-off between computational efficiency and chunking precision in LLM-based approaches, we devise the granularity-aware Mixture-of-Chunkers (MoC) framework, which consists of a three-stage processing mechanism. Notably, our objective is to guide the chunker towards generating a structured list of chunking regular expressions, which are subsequently employed to extract chunks from the original text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both our proposed metrics and the MoC framework effectively settle challenges of the chunking task, revealing the chunking kernel while enhancing the performance of the RAG system.|Jihao Zhao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09600)|null|

Investigating LLM Responses to Implicit Misinformation**|As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in diverse scenarios, the extent to which they could tacitly spread misinformation emerges as a critical safety concern. Current research primarily evaluates LLMs on explicit false statements, overlooking how misinformation often manifests subtly as unchallenged premises in real-world user interactions. We curated ECHOMIST, the first comprehensive benchmark for implicit misinformation, where the misinformed assumptions are embedded in a user query to LLMs. ECHOMIST is based on rigorous selection criteria and carefully curated data from diverse sources, including real-world human-AI conversations and social media interactions. We also introduce a new evaluation metric to measure whether LLMs can recognize and counter false information rather than amplify users' misconceptions. Through an extensive empirical study on a wide range of LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude, and Llama, we find that current models perform alarmingly poorly on this task, often failing to detect false premises and generating misleading explanations.

|**2025-03-12**|**SimLingo: Vision-Only Closed-Loop Autonomous Driving with Language-Action Alignment**|Integrating large language models (LLMs) into autonomous driving has attracted significant attention with the hope of improving generalization and explainability. However, existing methods often focus on either driving or vision-language understanding but achieving both high driving performance and extensive language understanding remains challenging. In addition, the dominant approach to tackle vision-language understanding is using visual question answering. However, for autonomous driving, this is only useful if it is aligned with the action space. Otherwise, the model's answers could be inconsistent with its behavior. Therefore, we propose a model that can handle three different tasks: (1) closed-loop driving, (2) vision-language understanding, and (3) language-action alignment. Our model SimLingo is based on a vision language model (VLM) and works using only camera, excluding expensive sensors like LiDAR.

|**2025-03-13**|**BIMBA: Selective-Scan Compression for Long-Range Video Question Answering**|Video Question Answering (VQA) in long videos poses the key challenge of extracting relevant information and modeling long-range dependencies from many redundant frames. The self-attention mechanism provides a general solution for sequence modeling, but it has a prohibitive cost when applied to a massive number of spatiotemporal tokens in long videos. Most prior methods rely on compression strategies to lower the computational cost, such as reducing the input length via sparse frame sampling or compressing the output sequence passed to the large language model (LLM) via space-time pooling. However, these naive approaches over-represent redundant information and often miss salient events or fast-occurring space-time patterns. In this work, we introduce BIMBA, an efficient state-space model to handle long-form videos. Our model leverages the selective scan algorithm to learn to effectively select critical information from high-dimensional video and transform it into a reduced token sequence for efficient LLM processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BIMBA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple long-form VQA benchmarks, including PerceptionTest, NExT-QA, EgoSchema, VNBench, LongVideoBench, and Video-MME.

|**2025-03-12**|**Cost-Optimal Grouped-Query Attention for Long-Context LLMs**|Building effective and efficient Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has recently become a research focus, requiring maximizing model language capabilities and minimizing training and deployment costs. Existing efforts have primarily described complex relationships among model performance, parameter size, and data size, as well as searched for the optimal compute allocation to train LLMs. However, they overlook the impacts of context length and attention head configuration (the number of query and key-value heads in grouped-query attention) on training and inference. In this paper, we systematically compare models with different parameter sizes, context lengths, and attention head configurations in terms of model performance, computational cost, and memory cost. Then, we extend the existing scaling methods, which are based solely on parameter size and training compute, to guide the construction of cost-optimal LLMs during both training and inference. Our quantitative scaling studies show that, when processing sufficiently long sequences, a larger model with fewer attention heads can achieve a lower loss while incurring lower computational and memory costs. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing practical LLMs, especially in long-context processing scenarios. We will publicly release our code and data.|Yingfa Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09579)|**[link](https://github.com/thunlp/cost-optimal-gqa)**|
|**2025-03-12**|**Plan-and-Act: Improving Planning of Agents for Long-Horizon Tasks**|Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in enabling language agents to tackle simple tasks. However, applying them for complex, multi-step, long-horizon tasks remains a challenge. Recent work have found success by separating high-level planning from low-level execution, which enables the model to effectively balance high-level planning objectives and low-level execution details. However, generating accurate plans remains difficult since LLMs are not inherently trained for this task. To address this, we propose Plan-and-Act, a novel framework that incorporates explicit planning into LLM-based agents and introduces a scalable method to enhance plan generation through a novel synthetic data generation method. Plan-and-Act consists of a Planner model which generates structured, high-level plans to achieve user goals, and an Executor model that translates these plans into environment-specific actions. To train the Planner effectively, we introduce a synthetic data generation method that annotates ground-truth trajectories with feasible plans, augmented with diverse and extensive examples to enhance generalization. We evaluate Plan-and-Act using web navigation as a representative long-horizon planning environment, demonstrating a state-of the-art 54% success rate on the WebArena-Lite benchmark.|Lutfi Eren Erdogan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09572)|null|
|**2025-03-13**|**Towards Reasoning Era: A Survey of Long Chain-of-Thought for Reasoning Large Language Models**|Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in complex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "test-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and test-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks. By providing a structured overview, this survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.|Qiguang Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09567)|null|
|**2025-03-13**|**Large Language Models for Multi-Facility Location Mechanism Design**|Designing strategyproof mechanisms for multi-facility location that optimize social costs based on agent preferences had been challenging due to the extensive domain knowledge required and poor worst-case guarantees. Recently, deep learning models have been proposed as alternatives. However, these models require some domain knowledge and extensive hyperparameter tuning as well as lacking interpretability, which is crucial in practice when transparency of the learned mechanisms is mandatory. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, named LLMMech, that addresses these limitations by incorporating large language models (LLMs) into an evolutionary framework for generating interpretable, hyperparameter-free, empirically strategyproof, and nearly optimal mechanisms. Our experimental results, evaluated on various problem settings where the social cost is arbitrarily weighted across agents and the agent preferences may not be uniformly distributed, demonstrate that the LLM-generated mechanisms generally outperform existing handcrafted baselines and deep learning models. Furthermore, the mechanisms exhibit impressive generalizability to out-of-distribution agent preferences and to larger instances with more agents.|Nguyen Thach et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09533)|null|
|**2025-03-12**|**Search-R1: Training LLMs to Reason and Leverage Search Engines with Reinforcement Learning**|Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Retrieval augmentation and tool-use training approaches where a search engine is treated as a tool lack complex multi-turn retrieval flexibility or require large-scale supervised data. Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities during inference to use search engines is not optimal, since the LLM does not learn how to optimally interact with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of the DeepSeek-R1 model where the LLM learns -- solely through reinforcement learning (RL) -- to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM rollouts with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 26% (Qwen2.5-7B), 21% (Qwen2.5-3B), and 10% (LLaMA3.2-3B) over SOTA baselines. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

|**2025-03-12**|**ReMA: Learning to Meta-think for LLMs with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**|Recent research on Reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sought to further enhance their performance by integrating meta-thinking -- enabling models to monitor, evaluate, and control their reasoning processes for more adaptive and effective problem-solving. However, current single-agent work lacks a specialized design for acquiring meta-thinking, resulting in low efficacy. To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforced Meta-thinking Agents (ReMA), a novel framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to elicit meta-thinking behaviors, encouraging LLMs to think about thinking. ReMA decouples the reasoning process into two hierarchical agents: a high-level meta-thinking agent responsible for generating strategic oversight and plans, and a low-level reasoning agent for detailed executions. Through iterative reinforcement learning with aligned objectives, these agents explore and learn collaboration, leading to improved generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent RL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level mathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks. Comprehensive ablation studies further illustrate the evolving dynamics of each distinct agent, providing valuable insights into how the meta-thinking reasoning process enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.|Ziyu Wan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09501)|null|
|**2025-03-11**|**Randomness, Not Representation: The Unreliability of Evaluating Cultural Alignment in LLMs**|Research on the 'cultural alignment' of Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged in response to growing interest in understanding representation across diverse stakeholders. Current approaches to evaluating cultural alignment borrow social science methodologies but often overlook systematic robustness checks. Here, we identify and test three assumptions behind current evaluation methods: (1) Stability: that cultural alignment is a property of LLMs rather than an artifact of evaluation design, (2) Extrapolability: that alignment with one culture on a narrow set of issues predicts alignment with that culture on others, and (3) Steerability: that LLMs can be reliably prompted to represent specific cultural perspectives. Through experiments examining both explicit and implicit preferences of leading LLMs, we find a high level of instability across presentation formats, incoherence between evaluated versus held-out cultural dimensions, and erratic behavior under prompt steering. We show that these inconsistencies can cause the results of an evaluation to be very sensitive to minor variations in methodology. Finally, we demonstrate in a case study on evaluation design that narrow experiments and a selective assessment of evidence can be used to paint an incomplete picture of LLMs' cultural alignment properties. Overall, these results highlight significant limitations of current approaches for evaluating the cultural alignment of LLMs.|Ariba Khan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08688)|null|
|**2025-03-11**|**Perplexity Trap: PLM-Based Retrievers Overrate Low Perplexity Documents**|Previous studies have found that PLM-based retrieval models exhibit a preference for LLM-generated content, assigning higher relevance scores to these documents even when their semantic quality is comparable to human-written ones. This phenomenon, known as source bias, threatens the sustainable development of the information access ecosystem. However, the underlying causes of source bias remain unexplored. In this paper, we explain the process of information retrieval with a causal graph and discover that PLM-based retrievers learn perplexity features for relevance estimation, causing source bias by ranking the documents with low perplexity higher. Theoretical analysis further reveals that the phenomenon stems from the positive correlation between the gradients of the loss functions in language modeling task and retrieval task. Based on the analysis, a causal-inspired inference-time debiasing method is proposed, called Causal Diagnosis and Correction (CDC). CDC first diagnoses the bias effect of the perplexity and then separates the bias effect from the overall estimated relevance score. Experimental results across three domains demonstrate the superior debiasing effectiveness of CDC, emphasizing the validity of our proposed explanatory framework.

|**2025-03-11**|**CoLMDriver: LLM-based Negotiation Benefits Cooperative Autonomous Driving**|Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving holds great promise for improving safety by addressing the perception and prediction uncertainties inherent in single-agent systems. However, traditional cooperative methods are constrained by rigid collaboration protocols and limited generalization to unseen interactive scenarios. While LLM-based approaches offer generalized reasoning capabilities, their challenges in spatial planning and unstable inference latency hinder their direct application in cooperative driving. To address these limitations, we propose CoLMDriver, the first full-pipeline LLM-based cooperative driving system, enabling effective language-based negotiation and real-time driving control. CoLMDriver features a parallel driving pipeline with two key components: (i) an LLM-based negotiation module under an actor-critic paradigm, which continuously refines cooperation policies through feedback from previous decisions of all vehicles; and (ii) an intention-guided waypoint generator, which translates negotiation outcomes into executable waypoints. Additionally, we introduce InterDrive, a CARLA-based simulation benchmark comprising 10 challenging interactive driving scenarios for evaluating V2V cooperation. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLMDriver significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an 11% higher success rate across diverse highly interactive V2V driving scenarios.

A key challenge is enabling them to self-correct. While prior research has relied on external tools or large proprietary models, this work explores self-correction in small language models (SLMs) through iterative fine-tuning using solely self-generated data. We introduce the Self-Taught Self-Correction (STaSC) algorithm, which incorporates multiple algorithmic design choices. Experimental results on a question-answering task demonstrate that STaSC effectively learns self-correction, leading to significant performance improvements. Our analysis further provides insights into the mechanisms of self-correction and the impact of different design choices on learning dynamics and overall performance.

However, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), interest in this task (in its classical definition) has decreased. In this study, we evaluate the performance of various LLMs on the WSD task. We extend a previous benchmark (XL-WSD) to re-design two subtasks suitable for LLM: 1) given a word in a sentence, the LLM must generate the correct definition; 2) given a word in a sentence and a set of predefined meanings, the LLM must select the correct one. The extended benchmark is built using the XL-WSD and BabelNet. The results indicate that LLMs perform well in zero-shot learning but cannot surpass current state-of-the-art methods. However, a fine-tuned model with a medium number of parameters outperforms all other models, including the state-of-the-art.|Pierpaolo Basile et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08662)|null|

We empirically study the ability of retrievers to satisfy malicious queries, both when used directly and when used in a retrieval augmented generation-based setup. Concretely, we investigate six leading retrievers, including NV-Embed and LLM2Vec, and find that given malicious requests, most retrievers can (for >50% of queries) select relevant harmful passages. For example, LLM2Vec correctly selects passages for 61.35% of our malicious queries. We further uncover an emerging risk with instruction-following retrievers, where highly relevant harmful information can be surfaced by exploiting their instruction-following capabilities. Finally, we show that even safety-aligned LLMs, such as Llama3, can satisfy malicious requests when provided with harmful retrieved passages in-context. In summary, our findings underscore the malicious misuse risks associated with increasing retriever capability.|Parishad BehnamGhader et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08644)|null|
|**2025-03-11**|**LightGen: Efficient Image Generation through Knowledge Distillation and Direct Preference Optimization**|Recent advances in text-to-image generation have primarily relied on extensive datasets and parameter-heavy architectures. These requirements severely limit accessibility for researchers and practitioners who lack substantial computational resources. In this paper, we introduce \model, an efficient training paradigm for image generation models that uses knowledge distillation (KD) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Drawing inspiration from the success of data KD techniques widely adopted in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), LightGen distills knowledge from state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image models into a compact Masked Autoregressive (MAR) architecture with only $0.7B$ parameters. Using a compact synthetic dataset of just $2M$ high-quality images generated from varied captions, we demonstrate that data diversity significantly outweighs data volume in determining model performance. This strategy dramatically reduces computational demands and reduces pre-training time from potentially thousands of GPU-days to merely 88 GPU-days. Furthermore, to address the inherent shortcomings of synthetic data, particularly poor high-frequency details and spatial inaccuracies, we integrate the DPO technique that refines image fidelity and positional accuracy. Comprehensive experiments confirm that LightGen achieves image generation quality comparable to SOTA models while significantly reducing computational resources and expanding accessibility for resource-constrained environments.

While advancements in large language models (LLMs) and embodied intelligence make this goal closer, several challenges persist: the lack of a unified benchmark for more complex robot tasks, limited evaluation methods and metrics, data incompatibility between LLMs and mobile manipulation trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce Embodied Mobile Manipulation in Open Environments (EMMOE), which requires agents to interpret user instructions and execute long-horizon everyday tasks in continuous space. EMMOE seamlessly integrates high-level and low-level embodied tasks into a unified framework, along with three new metrics for more diverse assessment. Additionally, we collect EMMOE-100, which features in various task attributes, detailed process annotations, re-plans after failures, and two sub-datasets for LLM training. Furthermore, we design HomieBot, a sophisticated agent system consists of LLM with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), light weighted navigation and manipulation models, and multiple error detection mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate HomieBot's performance and the evaluation of different models and policies.|Dongping Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08604)|null|

While previous datasets relied on published literature, we leverage grant abstracts which offer a unique advantage: they capture claims at an earlier stage in the research lifecycle before publication takes effect. We also introduce a new task to distinguish between existing scientific claims and aspirational research intentions in proposals.Using zero-shot prompting with frontier large language models, we jointly extract 114K scientific claims and 145K investigation proposals from 16K grant abstracts in the materials science domain to create a focused subset called NSF-SciFy-MatSci. We use this dataset to evaluate 3 three key tasks: (1) technical to non-technical abstract generation, where models achieve high BERTScore (0.85+ F1); (2) scientific claim extraction, where fine-tuned models outperform base models by 100% relative improvement; and (3) investigation proposal extraction, showing 90%+ improvement with fine-tuning. We introduce novel LLM-based evaluation metrics for robust assessment of claim/proposal extraction quality. As the largest scientific claim dataset to date -- with an estimated 2.8 million claims across all STEM disciplines funded by the NSF -- NSF-SciFy enables new opportunities for claim verification and meta-scientific research.

|**2025-03-11**|**HierarQ: Task-Aware Hierarchical Q-Former for Enhanced Video Understanding**|Despite advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), current approaches struggle in medium-to-long video understanding due to frame and context length limitations. As a result, these models often depend on frame sampling, which risks missing key information over time and lacks task-specific relevance. To address these challenges, we introduce HierarQ, a task-aware hierarchical Q-Former based framework that sequentially processes frames to bypass the need for frame sampling, while avoiding LLM's context length limitations. We introduce a lightweight two-stream language-guided feature modulator to incorporate task awareness in video understanding, with the entity stream capturing frame-level object information within a short context and the scene stream identifying their broader interactions over longer period of time. Each stream is supported by dedicated memory banks which enables our proposed Hierachical Querying transformer (HierarQ) to effectively capture short and long-term context. Extensive evaluations on 10 video benchmarks across video understanding, question answering, and captioning tasks demonstrate HierarQ's state-of-the-art performance across most datasets, proving its robustness and efficiency for comprehensive video analysis.|Shehreen Azad et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08585)|null|
|**2025-03-10**|**Talking to GDELT Through Knowledge Graphs**|In this work we study various Retrieval Augmented Regeneration (RAG) approaches to gain an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in a question-answering analysis. To gain this understanding we use a case-study subset of the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) dataset as well as a corpus of raw text scraped from the online news articles. To retrieve information from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the relevant subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from the ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval approaches. We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task. We find that while our ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant subgraphs is challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries, often lack consistency and interpretability. Our findings suggest benefits of a synergistic approach between ontology and LLM-based KG construction, with proposed avenues toward that end.|Audun Myers et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07584)|null|
|**2025-03-10**|**Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning**|Training models to effectively use test-time compute is crucial for improving the reasoning performance of LLMs. Current methods mostly do so via fine-tuning on search traces or running RL with 0/1 outcome reward, but do these approaches efficiently utilize test-time compute? Would these approaches continue to scale as the budget improves? In this paper, we try to answer these questions. We formalize the problem of optimizing test-time compute as a meta-reinforcement learning (RL) problem, which provides a principled perspective on spending test-time compute. This perspective enables us to view the long output stream from the LLM as consisting of several episodes run at test time and leads us to use a notion of cumulative regret over output tokens as a way to measure the efficacy of test-time compute. Akin to how RL algorithms can best tradeoff exploration and exploitation over training, minimizing cumulative regret would also provide the best balance between exploration and exploitation in the token stream. While we show that state-of-the-art models do not minimize regret, one can do so by maximizing a dense reward bonus in conjunction with the outcome 0/1 reward RL. This bonus is the ''progress'' made by each subsequent block in the output stream, quantified by the change in the likelihood of eventual success. Using these insights, we develop Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, or MRT, a new class of fine-tuning methods for optimizing test-time compute. MRT leads to a 2-3x relative gain in performance and roughly a 1.5x gain in token efficiency for math reasoning compared to outcome-reward RL.|Yuxiao Qu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07572)|null|

These studies have sought to understand developers' perspectives about using those tools, a fundamental pillar for successfully adopting LLM-based tools in Software Engineering. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of junior software developers' perspectives and use of LLM-based tools for software engineering (LLM4SE). We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) following guidelines by Kitchenham et al. on 56 primary studies, applying the definition for junior software developers as software developers with equal or less than five years of experience, including Computer Science/Software Engineering students. We found that the majority of the studies focused on comprehending the different aspects of integrating AI tools in SE. Only 8.9\% of the studies provide a clear definition for junior software developers, and there is no uniformity. Searching for relevant information is the most common task using LLM tools. ChatGPT was the most common LLM tool present in the studies (and experiments). A majority of the studies (83.9\%) report both positive and negative perceptions about the impact of adopting LLM tools. We also found and categorised advantages, challenges, and recommendations regarding LLM adoption. Our results indicate that developers are using LLMs not just for code generation, but also to improve their development skills. Critically, they are not just experiencing the benefits of adopting LLM tools, but they are also aware of at least a few LLM limitations, such as the generation of wrong suggestions, potential data leaking, and AI hallucination.

|**2025-03-10**|**KSOD: Knowledge Supplement for LLMs On Demand**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, yet still produce errors in domain-specific tasks. To further improve their performance, we propose KSOD (Knowledge Supplement for LLMs On Demand), a novel framework that empowers LLMs to improve their capabilities with knowledge-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT). KSOD analyzes the causes of errors from the perspective of knowledge deficiency by identifying potential missing knowledge in LLM that may lead to the errors. Subsequently, KSOD tunes a knowledge module on knowledge dataset and verifies whether the LLM lacks the identified knowledge based on it. If the knowledge is verified, KSOD supplements the LLM with the identified knowledge using the knowledge module. Tuning LLMs on specific knowledge instead of specific task decouples task and knowledge and our experiments on two domain-specific benchmarks and four general benchmarks empirically demonstrate that KSOD enhances the performance of LLMs on tasks requiring the supplemented knowledge while preserving their performance on other tasks. Our findings shed light on the potential of improving the capabilities of LLMs with knowledge-based SFT.|Haoran Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07550)|null|
|**2025-03-10**|**Bi-Directional Mental Model Reconciliation for Human-Robot Interaction with Large Language Models**|In human-robot interactions, human and robot agents maintain internal mental models of their environment, their shared task, and each other. The accuracy of these representations depends on each agent's ability to perform theory of mind, i.e. to understand the knowledge, preferences, and intentions of their teammate. When mental models diverge to the extent that it affects task execution, reconciliation becomes necessary to prevent the degradation of interaction. We propose a framework for bi-directional mental model reconciliation, leveraging large language models to facilitate alignment through semi-structured natural language dialogue. Our framework relaxes the assumption of prior model reconciliation work that either the human or robot agent begins with a correct model for the other agent to align to. Through our framework, both humans and robots are able to identify and communicate missing task-relevant context during interaction, iteratively progressing toward a shared mental model.|Nina Moorman et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07547)|null|

This integration raises numerous open questions about how predictions can be effectively leveraged to improve scheduling decisions. Recent studies explore queues with predicted service times, typically aiming to minimize job time in the system. We review these works, highlight the effectiveness of predictions, and present open questions on queue performance. We then move to consider an important practical example of using predictions in scheduling, namely Large Language Model (LLM) systems, which presents novel scheduling challenges and highlights the potential for predictions to improve performance. In particular, we consider LLMs performing inference. Inference requests (jobs) in LLM systems are inherently complex; they have variable inference times, dynamic memory footprints that are constrained by key-value (KV) store memory limitations, and multiple possible preemption approaches that affect performance differently. We provide background on the important aspects of scheduling in LLM systems, and introduce new models and open problems that arise from them. We argue that there are significant opportunities for applying insights and analysis from queueing theory to scheduling in LLM systems.|Michael Mitzenmacher et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07545)|null|

We introduce XIFBench, a comprehensive constraint-based benchmark for assessing multilingual instruction-following abilities of LLMs, featuring a novel taxonomy of five constraint categories and 465 parallel instructions across six languages spanning different resource levels. To ensure consistent cross-lingual evaluation, we develop a requirement-based protocol that leverages English requirements as semantic anchors. These requirements are then used to validate the translations across languages. Extensive experiments with various LLMs reveal notable variations in instruction-following performance across resource levels, identifying key influencing factors such as constraint categories, instruction complexity, and cultural specificity.|Zhenyu Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07539)|null|
|**2025-03-10**|**TokenButler: Token Importance is Predictable**|Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on the Key-Value (KV) Cache to store token history, enabling efficient decoding of tokens. As the KV-Cache grows, it becomes a major memory and computation bottleneck, however, there is an opportunity to alleviate this bottleneck, especially because prior research has shown that only a small subset of tokens contribute meaningfully to each decoding step. A key challenge in finding these critical tokens is that they are dynamic, and heavily input query-dependent. Existing methods either risk quality by evicting tokens permanently, or retain the full KV-Cache but rely on retrieving chunks (pages) of tokens at generation, failing at dense, context-rich tasks. Additionally, many existing KV-Cache sparsity methods rely on inaccurate proxies for token importance. To address these limitations, we introduce TokenButler, a high-granularity, query-aware predictor that learns to identify these critical tokens. By training a light-weight predictor with less than 1.2% parameter overhead, TokenButler prioritizes tokens based on their contextual, predicted importance. This improves perplexity & downstream accuracy by over 8% relative to SoTA methods for estimating token importance. We evaluate TokenButler on a novel synthetic small-context co-referential retrieval task, demonstrating near-oracle accuracy.

|**2025-03-10**|**Language Models Fail to Introspect About Their Knowledge of Language**|There has been recent interest in whether large language models (LLMs) can introspect about their own internal states. Such abilities would make LLMs more interpretable, and also validate the use of standard introspective methods in linguistics to evaluate grammatical knowledge in models (e.g., asking "Is this sentence grammatical?"). We systematically investigate emergent introspection across 21 open-source LLMs, in two domains where introspection is of theoretical interest: grammatical knowledge and word prediction. Crucially, in both domains, a model's internal linguistic knowledge can be theoretically grounded in direct measurements of string probability. We then evaluate whether models' responses to metalinguistic prompts faithfully reflect their internal knowledge. We propose a new measure of introspection: the degree to which a model's prompted responses predict its own string probabilities, beyond what would be predicted by another model with nearly identical internal knowledge. While both metalinguistic prompting and probability comparisons lead to high task accuracy, we do not find evidence that LLMs have privileged "self-access". Our findings complicate recent results suggesting that models can introspect, and add new evidence to the argument that prompted responses should not be conflated with models' linguistic generalizations.|Siyuan Song et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07513)|null|
|**2025-03-10**|**Plume: Scaffolding Text Composition in Dashboards**|Text in dashboards plays multiple critical roles, including providing context, offering insights, guiding interactions, and summarizing key information. Despite its importance, most dashboarding tools focus on visualizations and offer limited support for text authoring. To address this gap, we developed Plume, a system to help authors craft effective dashboard text. Through a formative review of exemplar dashboards, we created a typology of text parameters and articulated the relationship between visual placement and semantic connections, which informed Plume's design. Plume employs large language models (LLMs) to generate contextually appropriate content and provides guidelines for writing clear, readable text. A preliminary evaluation with 12 dashboard authors explored how assisted text authoring integrates into workflows, revealing strengths and limitations of LLM-generated text and the value of our human-in-the-loop approach. Our findings suggest opportunities to improve dashboard authoring tools by better supporting the diverse roles that text plays in conveying insights.|Maxim Lisnic et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07512)|null|
|**2025-03-10**|**LLaVA-RadZ: Can Multimodal Large Language Models Effectively Tackle Zero-shot Radiology Recognition?**|Recently, multimodal large models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in visual understanding and reasoning across various vision-language tasks. However, MLLMs usually perform poorly in zero-shot medical disease recognition, as they do not fully exploit the captured features and available medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LLaVA-RadZ, a simple yet effective framework for zero-shot medical disease recognition. Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities, which effectively utilizes image and text representations and facilitates robust cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. DKAM improves category-level alignment, allowing for accurate disease recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition and exhibits the state-of-the-art performance compared to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.|Bangyan Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07487)|null|

One important task is information retrieval (IR), which requires models to retrieve relevant documents. Despite its importance in many real-life applications, especially in retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, this task lacks Vietnamese benchmarks. This situation causes difficulty in assessing and comparing many existing Vietnamese embedding language models on the task and slows down the advancement of Vietnamese natural language processing (NLP) research. In this work, we aim to provide the Vietnamese research community with a new benchmark for information retrieval, which mainly focuses on retrieval and reranking tasks. Furthermore, we also present a new objective function based on the InfoNCE loss function, which is used to train our Vietnamese embedding model. Our function aims to be better than the origin in information retrieval tasks. Finally, we analyze the effect of temperature, a hyper-parameter in both objective functions, on the performance of text embedding models.|Phu-Vinh Nguyen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07470)|null|

However, personalizing extensive textual materials, such as narratives and academic textbooks, remains challenging due to their heavy use, which can hinder learner engagement and understanding. Building on cognitive theories like Dual Coding Theory -- which posits that combining textual and visual information enhances comprehension and memory -- this study explores the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) to enrich educational materials. We utilized large language models (LLMs) to generate concise text summaries and image generation models (IGMs) to create visually aligned content from textual inputs. After recruiting 24 participants, we verified that integrating AI-generated supplementary materials significantly improved learning outcomes, increasing post-reading test scores by 7.50%. These findings underscore GenAI's transformative potential in creating adaptive learning environments that enhance cognitive augmentation.|Ryugo Morita et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07463)|null|
|**2025-03-10**|**MedAgentsBench: Benchmarking Thinking Models and Agent Frameworks for Complex Medical Reasoning**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on existing medical question-answering benchmarks. This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints.

In this paper, we study empirically whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit the same behavior of conversational adaptation. We construct a corpus of conversations between LLMs and find that two LLM agents end up making more similar syntactic choices as conversations go on, confirming that modern LLMs adapt their language use to their conversational partners in at least a rudimentary way.|Florian Kandra et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07457)|null|
|**2025-03-10**|**Anatomy-Aware Conditional Image-Text Retrieval**|Image-Text Retrieval (ITR) finds broad applications in healthcare, aiding clinicians and radiologists by automatically retrieving relevant patient cases in the database given the query image and/or report, for more efficient clinical diagnosis and treatment, especially for rare diseases. However conventional ITR systems typically only rely on global image or text representations for measuring patient image/report similarities, which overlook local distinctiveness across patient cases. This often results in suboptimal retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose an Anatomical Location-Conditioned Image-Text Retrieval (ALC-ITR) framework, which, given a query image and the associated suspicious anatomical region(s), aims to retrieve similar patient cases exhibiting the same disease or symptoms in the same anatomical region. To perform location-conditioned multimodal retrieval, we learn a medical Relevance-Region-Aligned Vision Language (RRA-VL) model with semantic global-level and region-/word-level alignment to produce generalizable, well-aligned multi-modal representations. Additionally, we perform location-conditioned contrastive learning to further utilize cross-pair region-level contrastiveness for improved multi-modal retrieval. We show that our proposed RRA-VL achieves state-of-the-art localization performance in phase-grounding tasks, and satisfying multi-modal retrieval performance with or without location conditioning. Finally, we thoroughly investigate the generalizability and explainability of our proposed ALC-ITR system in providing explanations and preliminary diagnosis reports given retrieved patient cases (conditioned on anatomical regions), with proper off-the-shelf LLM prompts.|Meng Zheng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07456)|null|

|**2025-03-10**|**From Text to Visuals: Using LLMs to Generate Math Diagrams with Vector Graphics**|Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for enhancing math education by automating support for both teachers and students. While prior work has focused on generating math problems and high-quality distractors, the role of visualization in math learning remains under-explored. Diagrams are essential for mathematical thinking and problem-solving, yet manually creating them is time-consuming and requires domain-specific expertise, limiting scalability. Recent research on using LLMs to generate Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) presents a promising approach to automating diagram creation. Unlike pixel-based images, SVGs represent geometric figures using XML, allowing seamless scaling and adaptability. Educational platforms such as Khan Academy and IXL already use SVGs to display math problems and hints. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate math-related diagrams that accompany textual hints via intermediate SVG representations. We address three research questions: (1) how to automatically generate math diagrams in problem-solving hints and evaluate their quality, (2) whether SVG is an effective intermediate representation for math diagrams, and (3) what prompting strategies and formats are required for LLMs to generate accurate SVG-based diagrams. Our contributions include defining the task of automatically generating SVG-based diagrams for math hints, developing an LLM prompting-based pipeline, and identifying key strategies for improving diagram generation. Additionally, we introduce a Visual Question Answering-based evaluation setup and conduct ablation studies to assess different pipeline variations. By automating the math diagram creation, we aim to provide students and teachers with accurate, conceptually relevant visual aids that enhance problem-solving and learning experiences.|Jaewook Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07429)|null|

While DPO establishes an offline paradigm with single hyperparameter $\beta$, subsequent methods like SimPO reintroduce complexity through dual parameters ($\beta$, $\gamma$). We propose {ReLU-based Preference Optimization (RePO)}, a streamlined algorithm that eliminates $\beta$ via two advances: (1) retaining SimPO's reference-free margins but removing $\beta$ through gradient analysis, and (2) adopting a ReLU-based max-margin loss that naturally filters trivial pairs. Theoretically, RePO is characterized as SimPO's limiting case ($\beta \to \infty$ ), where the logistic weighting collapses to binary thresholding, forming a convex envelope of the 0-1 loss. Empirical results on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard show that RePO outperforms DPO and SimPO across multiple base models, requiring only one hyperparameter to tune.|Junkang Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07426)|null|
|**2025-03-10**|**REF-VLM: Triplet-Based Referring Paradigm for Unified Visual Decoding**|Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate robust zero-shot capabilities across diverse vision-language tasks after training on mega-scale datasets. However, dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and keypoint detection, pose significant challenges for MLLMs when represented solely as text outputs. Simultaneously, current MLLMs utilizing latent embeddings for visual task decoding generally demonstrate limited adaptability to both multi-task learning and multi-granularity scenarios. In this work, we present REF-VLM, an end-to-end framework for unified training of various visual decoding tasks. To address complex visual decoding scenarios, we introduce the Triplet-Based Referring Paradigm (TRP), which explicitly decouples three critical dimensions in visual decoding tasks through a triplet structure: concepts, decoding types, and targets. TRP employs symbolic delimiters to enforce structured representation learning, enhancing the parsability and interpretability of model outputs. Additionally, we construct Visual-Task Instruction Following Dataset (VTInstruct), a large-scale multi-task dataset containing over 100 million multimodal dialogue samples across 25 task types. Beyond text inputs and outputs, VT-Instruct incorporates various visual prompts such as point, box, scribble, and mask, and generates outputs composed of text and visual units like box, keypoint, depth and mask. The combination of different visual prompts and visual units generates a wide variety of task types, expanding the applicability of REF-VLM significantly. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our REF-VLM outperforms other MLLMs across a variety of standard benchmarks.

Knowledge editing offers a promising alternative, but methods are only tested on small-scale or synthetic edit benchmarks. In this work, we aim to bridge research into lifelong knowledge editing to real-world edits at practically relevant scale. We first introduce WikiBigEdit; a large-scale benchmark of real-world Wikidata edits, built to automatically extend lifelong for future-proof benchmarking. In its first instance, it includes over 500K question-answer pairs for knowledge editing alongside a comprehensive evaluation pipeline. Finally, we use WikiBigEdit to study existing knowledge editing techniques' ability to incorporate large volumes of real-world facts and contrast their capabilities to generic modification techniques such as retrieval augmentation and continual finetuning to acquire a complete picture of the practical extent of current lifelong knowledge editing.|Lukas Thede et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05683)|null|
|**2025-03-07**|**AIM-Fair: Advancing Algorithmic Fairness via Selectively Fine-Tuning Biased Models with Contextual Synthetic Data**|Recent advances in generative models have sparked research on improving model fairness with AI-generated data. However, existing methods often face limitations in the diversity and quality of synthetic data, leading to compromised fairness and overall model accuracy. Moreover, many approaches rely on the availability of demographic group labels, which are often costly to annotate. This paper proposes AIM-Fair, aiming to overcome these limitations and harness the potential of cutting-edge generative models in promoting algorithmic fairness. We investigate a fine-tuning paradigm starting from a biased model initially trained on real-world data without demographic annotations. This model is then fine-tuned using unbiased synthetic data generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model to improve its fairness. Two key challenges are identified in this fine-tuning paradigm, 1) the low quality of synthetic data, which can still happen even with advanced generative models, and 2) the domain and bias gap between real and synthetic data. To address the limitation of synthetic data quality, we propose Contextual Synthetic Data Generation (CSDG) to generate data using a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I) with prompts generated by a context-aware LLM, ensuring both data diversity and control of bias in synthetic data. To resolve domain and bias shifts, we introduce a novel selective fine-tuning scheme in which only model parameters more sensitive to bias and less sensitive to domain shift are updated. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace datasets show that our AIM-Fair improves model fairness while maintaining utility, outperforming both fully and partially fine-tuned approaches to model fairness.|Zengqun Zhao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05665)|null|

The vast amount of content created, shared, and disseminated online has made it increasingly difficult to access relevant information. Over the past two decades, search and recommendation systems (collectively referred to as information retrieval systems) have evolved significantly to address these challenges. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities that surpass human performance in various language-related tasks and exhibit general understanding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities. This paper explores the transformative potential of large language model agents in enhancing search and recommendation systems. We discuss the motivations and roles of LLM agents, and establish a classification framework to elaborate on the existing research. We highlight the immense potential of LLM agents in addressing current challenges in search and recommendation, providing insights into future research directions.

|**2025-03-07**|**Symbolic Mixture-of-Experts: Adaptive Skill-based Routing for Heterogeneous Reasoning**|Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting experts at the task level is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that Symbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.|Justin Chih-Yao Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05641)|null|

However, analyzing live dialogues in real-time necessitates low-latency processing systems, making it impractical to deploy models with billions of parameters due to latency constraints. As a result, practitioners often prefer smaller models with millions of parameters, trained on high-quality, human-annotated datasets. Yet, curating such datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Consequently, there is a growing need to combine the scalability of LLM-generated labels with the precision of human annotations, enabling fine-tuned smaller models to achieve both higher speed and accuracy comparable to larger models. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective framework to address this challenge. Our approach is specifically designed for per-utterance classification problems, which encompass tasks such as intent detection, dialogue state tracking, and more. To mitigate the impact of labeling errors from LLMs -- the primary source of inaccuracies in student models -- we propose a noise-reduced preference learning loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves accuracy across utterance-level dialogue tasks, including sentiment detection (over $2\%$), dialogue act classification (over $1.5\%$ ), etc.|Xuanqing Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05620)|null|

Recently, mechanistic interpretability has attracted significant attention from the research community as a means to understand the inner workings of LLMs. Among various mechanistic interpretability approaches, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a particularly promising method due to their ability to disentangle the complex, superimposed features within LLMs into more interpretable components. This paper presents a comprehensive examination of SAEs as a promising approach to interpreting and understanding LLMs. We provide a systematic overview of SAE principles, architectures, and applications specifically tailored for LLM analysis, covering theoretical foundations, implementation strategies, and recent developments in sparsity mechanisms. We also explore how SAEs can be leveraged to explain the internal workings of LLMs, steer model behaviors in desired directions, and develop more transparent training methodologies for future models.

While they achieve remarkable performance on challenging tasks such as mathematics and coding, they often rely on their internal knowledge to solve problems, which can be inadequate for time-sensitive or knowledge-intensive questions, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address this, we propose \textbf{R1-Searcher}, a novel two-stage outcome-based RL approach designed to enhance the search capabilities of LLMs. This method allows LLMs to autonomously invoke external search systems to access additional knowledge during the reasoning process. Our framework relies exclusively on RL, without requiring process rewards or distillation for a cold start. % effectively generalizing to out-of-domain datasets and supporting both Base and Instruct models.

|**2025-03-07**|**Quantifying the Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models Against Spurious Features in Grounding Data**|Robustness has become a critical attribute for the deployment of RAG systems in real-world applications. Existing research focuses on robustness to explicit noise (e.g., document semantics) but overlooks spurious features (a.k.a. implicit noise). While previous works have explored spurious features in LLMs, they are limited to specific features (e.g., formats) and narrow scenarios (e.g., ICL). In this work, we statistically confirm the presence of spurious features in the RAG paradigm, a robustness problem caused by the sensitivity of LLMs to semantic-agnostic features. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of spurious features and empirically quantify their impact through controlled experiments. Further analysis reveals that not all spurious features are harmful and they can even be beneficial sometimes. Extensive evaluation results across multiple LLMs suggest that spurious features are a widespread and challenging problem in the field of RAG. The code and dataset will be released to facilitate future research.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potential tools for assisting in this task, but their effectiveness remains uncertain. This study evaluates the fact-checking capabilities of various open-source LLMs, focusing on their ability to assess claims with different levels of contextual information. We conduct three key experiments: (1) evaluating whether LLMs can identify the semantic relationship between a claim and a fact-checking article, (2) assessing models' accuracy in verifying claims when given a related fact-checking article, and (3) testing LLMs' fact-checking abilities when leveraging data from external knowledge sources such as Google and Wikipedia. Our results indicate that LLMs perform well in identifying claim-article connections and verifying fact-checked stories but struggle with confirming factual news, where they are outperformed by traditional fine-tuned models such as RoBERTa. Additionally, the introduction of external knowledge does not significantly enhance LLMs' performance, calling for more tailored approaches. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automated fact-checking, emphasizing the need for further refinements before they can reliably replace human fact-checkers.|Nicolo' Fontana et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05565)|null|

EMDM integrates final answer and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning correctness, assigning weights based on the complexity and reasoning depth required to solve a given sample in the evaluation data. Using a baseline LLM in two setups-Unguided, where the model has no prior exposure to test samples, and Guided, where the model has prior knowledge of the desired answer-EMDM distinguishes instances of varying difficulty. The CoT and answer correctness from these setups inform an optimization objective for weight assignment, resulting in a more nuanced evaluation of model performance.

Using this scaling law, we formulate the Long-context Language Modeling (L$^2$ M) condition, which relates a model's capacity for effective long context length modeling to the scaling of its latent state size for storing past information. Our results are validated through experiments on both transformers and state space models.

Existing speech-enabled LLMs often degrade conversational quality by modifying the LLM, thereby compromising its linguistic capabilities. In contrast, we propose LLMVoX, a lightweight 30M-parameter, LLM-agnostic, autoregressive streaming TTS system that generates high-quality speech with low latency, while fully preserving the capabilities of the base LLM. Our approach achieves a significantly lower Word Error Rate compared to speech-enabled LLMs, while operating at comparable latency and UTMOS score. By decoupling speech synthesis from LLM processing via a multi-queue token streaming system, LLMVoX supports seamless, infinite-length dialogues. Its plug-and-play design also facilitates extension to various tasks with different backbones. Furthermore, LLMVoX generalizes to new languages with only dataset adaptation, attaining a low Character Error Rate on an Arabic speech task. Additionally, we have integrated LLMVoX with a Vision-Language Model to create an omni-model with speech, text, and vision capabilities, without requiring additional multimodal training.

Using a controlled setting of biased coin flips, we find that: (1) LLMs often possess biased priors, causing initial divergence in zero-shot settings, (2) in-context evidence outweighs explicit bias instructions, (3) LLMs broadly follow Bayesian posterior updates, with deviations primarily due to miscalibrated priors rather than flawed updates, and (4) attention magnitude has negligible effect on Bayesian inference.

|**2025-03-06**|**Predictable Scale: Part I -- Optimal Hyperparameter Scaling Law in Large Language Model Pretraining**|The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks are now well-established, yet their effective deployment necessitates careful hyperparameter optimization. Through extensive empirical studies involving grid searches across diverse configurations, we discover universal scaling laws governing these hyperparameters: optimal learning rate follows a power-law relationship with both model parameters and data sizes, while optimal batch size scales primarily with data sizes. Our analysis reveals a convex optimization landscape for hyperparameters under fixed models and data size conditions. This convexity implies an optimal hyperparameter plateau. We contribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the community. Its estimated values on the test set are merely 0.07\% away from the globally optimal LLM performance found via an exhaustive search. These laws demonstrate remarkable robustness across variations in model sparsity, training data distribution, and model shape. To our best known, this is the first work that unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts models and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter scaling laws across diverse data distributions. This exhaustive optimization process demands substantial computational resources, utilizing nearly one million NVIDIA H800 GPU hours to train 3,700 LLMs of varying sizes and hyperparameters from scratch and consuming approximately 100 trillion tokens in total. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we will progressively release all loss measurements and model checkpoints through our designated repository https://step-law.github.io/|Houyi Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04715)|null|
|**2025-03-07**|**Universality of Layer-Level Entropy-Weighted Quantization Beyond Model Architecture and Size**|We present a novel approach to selective model quantization that transcends the limitations of architecture-specific and size-dependent compression methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) using Entropy-Weighted Quantization (EWQ). By analyzing the entropy distribution across transformer blocks, EWQ determines which blocks can be safely quantized without causing significant performance degradation, independent of model architecture or size. Our method outperforms uniform quantization approaches, maintaining Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) accuracy scores within 0.5% of unquantized models while reducing memory usage by up to 18%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EWQ across multiple architectures -- from 1.6B to 70B parameters -- and showcase consistent improvements in the quality-compression trade-off regardless of model scale or architectural design. A surprising finding of EWQ is its ability to reduce perplexity compared to unquantized models, suggesting the presence of beneficial regularization through selective precision reduction. This improvement holds across different model families, indicating a fundamental relationship between layer-level entropy and optimal precision requirements. Additionally, we introduce FastEWQ, a rapid method for entropy distribution analysis that eliminates the need for loading model weights. This technique leverages universal characteristics of entropy distribution that persist across various architectures and scales, enabling near-instantaneous quantization decisions while maintaining 80% classification accuracy with full entropy analysis. Our results demonstrate that effective quantization strategies can be developed independently of specific architectural choices or model sizes, opening new possibilities for efficient LLM deployment.|Alireza Behtash et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04704)|null|
|**2025-03-06**|**UIPE: Enhancing LLM Unlearning by Removing Knowledge Related to Forgetting Targets**|Large Language Models (LLMs) inevitably acquire harmful information during training on massive datasets. LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of such harmful information while maintaining the model's overall performance. Existing unlearning methods, represented by gradient ascent-based approaches, primarily focus on forgetting target data while overlooking the crucial impact of logically related knowledge on the effectiveness of unlearning. In this paper, through both theoretical and experimental analyses, we first demonstrate that a key reason for the suboptimal unlearning performance is that models can reconstruct the target content through reasoning with logically related knowledge. To address this issue, we propose Unlearning Improvement via Parameter Extrapolation (UIPE), a method that removes knowledge highly correlated with the forgetting targets. Experimental results show that UIPE significantly enhances the performance of various mainstream LLM unlearning methods on the TOFU benchmark.|Wenyu Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04693)|null|
|**2025-03-06**|**Quantifying the Reasoning Abilities of LLMs on Real-world Clinical Cases**|The latest reasoning-enhanced large language models (reasoning LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o3, have demonstrated remarkable success. However, the application of such reasoning enhancements to the highly professional medical domain has not been clearly evaluated, particularly regarding with not only assessing the final generation but also examining the quality of their reasoning processes. In this study, we present MedR-Bench, a reasoning-focused medical evaluation benchmark comprising 1,453 structured patient cases with reasoning references mined from case reports. Our benchmark spans 13 body systems and 10 specialty disorders, encompassing both common and rare diseases. In our evaluation, we introduce a versatile framework consisting of three critical clinical stages: assessment recommendation, diagnostic decision-making, and treatment planning, comprehensively capturing the LLMs' performance across the entire patient journey in healthcare. For metrics, we propose a novel agentic system, Reasoning Evaluator, designed to automate and objectively quantify free-text reasoning responses in a scalable manner from the perspectives of efficiency, factuality, and completeness by dynamically searching and performing cross-referencing checks. As a result, we assess five state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, and others. Our results reveal that current LLMs can handle relatively simple diagnostic tasks with sufficient critical assessment results, achieving accuracy generally over 85%. However, they still struggle with more complex tasks, such as assessment recommendation and treatment planning. In reasoning, their reasoning processes are generally reliable, with factuality scores exceeding 90%, though they often omit critical reasoning steps. Our study clearly reveals further development directions for current clinical LLMs.|Pengcheng Qiu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04691)|null|

We find, with Mirzadeh et al. (2024), that current LLM progress on the data set may not be explained by better reasoning but by exposure to a broader pretraining data distribution. We then introduce a novel information source for helping models with less data or inferior training reason better: discourse structure. We show that discourse structure improves performance for models like Llama2 13b by up to 160%. Even for models that have most likely memorized the data set, adding discourse structural information to the model still improves predictions and dramatically improves large model performance on out of distribution examples.|Krish Sharma et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04685)|null|
|**2025-03-06**|**LLM-guided Plan and Retrieval: A Strategic Alignment for Interpretable User Satisfaction Estimation in Dialogue**|Understanding user satisfaction with conversational systems, known as User Satisfaction Estimation (USE), is essential for assessing dialogue quality and enhancing user experiences. However, existing methods for USE face challenges due to limited understanding of underlying reasons for user dissatisfaction and the high costs of annotating user intentions. To address these challenges, we propose PRAISE (Plan and Retrieval Alignment for Interpretable Satisfaction Estimation), an interpretable framework for effective user satisfaction prediction. PRAISE operates through three key modules. The Strategy Planner develops strategies, which are natural language criteria for classifying user satisfaction. The Feature Retriever then incorporates knowledge on user satisfaction from Large Language Models (LLMs) and retrieves relevance features from utterances. Finally, the Score Analyzer evaluates strategy predictions and classifies user satisfaction. Experimental results demonstrate that PRAISE achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks for the USE task. Beyond its superior performance, PRAISE offers additional benefits. It enhances interpretability by providing instance-level explanations through effective alignment of utterances with strategies. Moreover, PRAISE operates more efficiently than existing approaches by eliminating the need for LLMs during the inference phase.|Sangyeop Kim et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04675)|null|
|**2025-03-05**|**The MASK Benchmark: Disentangling Honesty From Accuracy in AI Systems**|As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and agentic, the requirement for trust in their outputs grows significantly, yet at the same time concerns have been mounting that models may learn to lie in pursuit of their goals. To address these concerns, a body of work has emerged around the notion of "honesty" in LLMs, along with interventions aimed at mitigating deceptive behaviors. However, evaluations of honesty are currently highly limited, with no benchmark combining large scale and applicability to all models. Moreover, many benchmarks claiming to measure honesty in fact simply measure accuracy--the correctness of a model's beliefs--in disguise. In this work, we introduce a large-scale human-collected dataset for measuring honesty directly, allowing us to disentangle accuracy from honesty for the first time. Across a diverse set of LLMs, we find that while larger models obtain higher accuracy on our benchmark, they do not become more honest. Surprisingly, while most frontier LLMs obtain high scores on truthfulness benchmarks, we find a substantial propensity in frontier LLMs to lie when pressured to do so, resulting in low honesty scores on our benchmark. We find that simple methods, such as representation engineering interventions, can improve honesty. These results underscore the growing need for robust evaluations and effective interventions to ensure LLMs remain trustworthy.|Richard Ren et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03750)|null|
|**2025-03-05**|**Process-based Self-Rewarding Language Models**|Large Language Models have demonstrated outstanding performance across various downstream tasks and have been widely applied in multiple scenarios. Human-annotated preference data is used for training to further improve LLMs' performance, which is constrained by the upper limit of human performance. Therefore, Self-Rewarding method has been proposed, where LLMs generate training data by rewarding their own outputs. However, the existing self-rewarding paradigm is not effective in mathematical reasoning scenarios and may even lead to a decline in performance. In this work, we propose the Process-based Self-Rewarding pipeline for language models, which introduces long-thought reasoning, step-wise LLM-as-a-Judge, and step-wise preference optimization within the self-rewarding paradigm. Our new paradigm successfully enhances the performance of LLMs on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks through iterative Process-based Self-Rewarding, demonstrating the immense potential of self-rewarding to achieve LLM reasoning that may surpass human capabilities.|Shimao Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03746)|null|
|**2025-03-05**|**Towards Understanding Distilled Reasoning Models: A Representational Approach**|In this paper, we investigate how model distillation impacts the development of reasoning features in large language models (LLMs). To explore this, we train a crosscoder on Qwen-series models and their fine-tuned variants. Our results suggest that the crosscoder learns features corresponding to various types of reasoning, including self-reflection and computation verification. Moreover, we observe that distilled models contain unique reasoning feature directions, which could be used to steer the model into over-thinking or incisive-thinking mode. In particular, we perform analysis on four specific reasoning categories: (a) self-reflection, (b) deductive reasoning, (c) alternative reasoning, and (d) contrastive reasoning. Finally, we examine the changes in feature geometry resulting from the distillation process and find indications that larger distilled models may develop more structured representations, which correlate with enhanced distillation performance. By providing insights into how distillation modifies the model, our study contributes to enhancing the transparency and reliability of AI systems.|David D.

|**2025-03-05**|**Improving LLM Safety Alignment with Dual-Objective Optimization**|Existing training-time safety alignment techniques for large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Direct preference optimization (DPO), a widely deployed alignment method, exhibits limitations in both experimental and theoretical contexts as its loss function proves suboptimal for refusal learning. Through gradient-based analysis, we identify these shortcomings and propose an improved safety alignment that disentangles DPO objectives into two components: (1) robust refusal training, which encourages refusal even when partial unsafe generations are produced, and (2) targeted unlearning of harmful knowledge. This approach significantly increases LLM robustness against a wide range of jailbreak attacks, including prefilling, suffix, and multi-turn attacks across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a method to emphasize critical refusal tokens by incorporating a reward-based token-level weighting mechanism for refusal learning, which further improves the robustness against adversarial exploits. Our research also suggests that robustness to jailbreak attacks is correlated with token distribution shifts in the training process and internal representations of refusal and harmful tokens, offering valuable directions for future research in LLM safety alignment.

|**2025-03-05**|**Effective LLM Knowledge Learning via Model Generalization**|Large language models (LLMs) are trained on enormous documents that contain extensive world knowledge. However, it is still not well-understood how knowledge is acquired via autoregressive pre-training. This lack of understanding greatly hinders effective knowledge learning, especially for continued pretraining on up-to-date information, as this evolving information often lacks diverse repetitions like foundational knowledge. In this paper, we focus on understanding and improving LLM knowledge learning. We found and verified that knowledge learning for LLMs can be deemed as an implicit supervised task hidden in the autoregressive pre-training objective. Our findings suggest that knowledge learning for LLMs would benefit from methods designed to improve generalization ability for supervised tasks. Based on our analysis, we propose the formatting-based data augmentation to grow in-distribution samples, which does not present the risk of altering the facts embedded in documents as text paraphrasing. We also introduce sharpness-aware minimization as an effective optimization algorithm to better improve generalization. Moreover, our analysis and method can be readily extended to instruction tuning. Extensive experiment results validate our findings and demonstrate our methods' effectiveness in both continued pre-training and instruction tuning.

|**2025-03-05**|**A Practical Memory Injection Attack against LLM Agents**|Agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, that enables the injection of malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps leading to undesirable agent actions when executing the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link the victim query to the malicious reasoning steps. During the injection of the malicious record, we propose an indication prompt to guide the agent to autonomously generate our designed bridging steps. We also propose a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing the victim query comes after. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting practical risks of LLM agents.|Shen Dong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03704)|null|
|**2025-03-05**|**Developing and Utilizing a Large-Scale Cantonese Dataset for Multi-Tasking in Large Language Models**|High-quality data resources play a crucial role in learning large language models (LLMs), particularly for low-resource languages like Cantonese. Despite having more than 85 million native speakers, Cantonese is still considered a low-resource language in the field of natural language processing (NLP) due to factors such as the dominance of Mandarin, lack of cohesion within the Cantonese-speaking community, diversity in character encoding and input methods, and the tendency of overseas Cantonese speakers to prefer using English. In addition, rich colloquial vocabulary of Cantonese, English loanwords, and code-switching characteristics add to the complexity of corpus collection and processing. To address these challenges, we collect Cantonese texts from a variety of sources, including open source corpora, Hong Kong-specific forums, Wikipedia, and Common Crawl data. We conduct rigorous data processing through language filtering, quality filtering, content filtering, and de-duplication steps, successfully constructing a high-quality Cantonese corpus of over 2 billion tokens for training large language models. We further refined the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on curated Cantonese tasks, enhancing its ability to handle specific applications. Upon completion of the training, the model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four Cantonese benchmarks. After training on our dataset, the model also exhibits improved performance on other mainstream language tasks.|Jiyue Jiang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03702)|null|
|**2025-03-05**|**Addressing Overprescribing Challenges: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Medication Recommendation Tasks**|Medication recommendation systems have garnered attention within healthcare for their potential to deliver personalized and efficacious drug combinations based on patient's clinical data. However, existing methodologies encounter challenges in adapting to diverse Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems and effectively utilizing unstructured data, resulting in limited generalization capabilities and suboptimal performance. Recently, interest is growing in harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain to support healthcare professionals and enhance patient care. Despite the emergence of medical LLMs and their promising results in tasks like medical question answering, their practical applicability in clinical settings, particularly in medication recommendation, often remains underexplored.   In this study, we evaluate both general-purpose and medical-specific LLMs for medication recommendation tasks. Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently encounter the challenge of overprescribing, leading to heightened clinical risks and diminished medication recommendation accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Language-Assisted Medication Recommendation (LAMO), which employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to tailor open-source LLMs for optimal performance in medication recommendation scenarios. LAMO leverages the wealth of clinical information within clinical notes, a resource often underutilized in traditional methodologies. As a result of our approach, LAMO outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in internal validation accuracy. Furthermore, temporal and external validations demonstrate LAMO's robust generalization capabilities across various temporal and hospital contexts. Additionally, an out-of-distribution medication recommendation experiment demonstrates LAMO's remarkable accuracy even with medications outside the training data.|Zihao Zhao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03687)|null|

However, to design effective MAS, existing approaches heavily rely on manual configurations or multiple calls of advanced LLMs, resulting in inadaptability and high inference costs. In this paper, we simplify the process of building an MAS by reframing it as a generative language task, where the input is a user query and the output is a corresponding MAS. To address this novel task, we unify the representation of MAS as executable code and propose a consistency-oriented data construction pipeline to create a high-quality dataset comprising coherent and consistent query-MAS pairs. Using this dataset, we train MAS-GPT, an open-source medium-sized LLM that is capable of generating query-adaptive MAS within a single LLM inference. The generated MAS can be seamlessly applied to process user queries and deliver high-quality responses. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmarks and 5 LLMs show that the proposed MAS-GPT consistently outperforms 10+ baseline MAS methods on diverse settings, indicating MAS-GPT's high effectiveness, efficiency and strong generalization ability.

|**2025-03-05**|**Attentive Reasoning Queries: A Systematic Method for Optimizing Instruction-Following in Large Language Models**|We present Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs), a novel structured reasoning approach that significantly improves instruction-following in Large Language Models through domain-specialized reasoning blueprints. While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they often fail to maintain adherence to complex, use-case-specific instructions during multi-turn conversations, presenting challenges for business-critical applications. ARQs address this limitation by guiding LLMs through systematic reasoning steps with targeted queries that reinstate critical instructions and facilitate intermediate reasoning throughout the completion process. In extensive testing within Parlant, our framework for reliable customer-facing agents in which ARQs were born out of necessity, they achieved a 90.2% success rate across 87 test scenarios, outperforming both Chain-of-Thought reasoning (86.1%) and direct response generation (81.5%). ARQs showed particular strength in addressing persistent failure modes like guideline re-application and hallucination prevention. Our analysis also revealed that ARQs can potentially be more computationally efficient than free-form reasoning when carefully designed. These findings demonstrate that structured reasoning approaches provide effective mechanisms for controlling how LLMs process information and make decisions in complex scenarios.|Bar Karov et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03669)|null|

We begin by analyzing page views and article content to study Wikipedia's recent changes and assess the impact of LLMs. Subsequently, we evaluate how LLMs affect various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks related to Wikipedia, including machine translation and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our findings and simulation results reveal that Wikipedia articles have been influenced by LLMs, with an impact of approximately 1%-2% in certain categories. If the machine translation benchmark based on Wikipedia is influenced by LLMs, the scores of the models may become inflated, and the comparative results among models might shift as well. Moreover, the effectiveness of RAG might decrease if the knowledge base becomes polluted by LLM-generated content. While LLMs have not yet fully changed Wikipedia's language and knowledge structures, we believe that our empirical findings signal the need for careful consideration of potential future risks.|Siming Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02879)|null|

To address this bottleneck, we present self-taught lookahead, a self-supervised method that leverages state-transition dynamics to train a value model capable of effectively guiding language model-controlled search. We find that moderately sized (8 billion parameters) open-weight value models improved with self-taught lookahead can match the performance of using a frontier LLM such as gpt-4o as the value model. Furthermore, we find that self-taught lookahead improves performance by 20% while reducing costs 37x compared to previous LLM-based tree search, without relying on ground truth rewards.|Ethan Mendes et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02878)|null|
|**2025-03-04**|**The First Few Tokens Are All You Need: An Efficient and Effective Unsupervised Prefix Fine-Tuning Method for Reasoning Models**|Improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) typically requires supervised fine-tuning with labeled data or computationally expensive sampling. We introduce Unsupervised Prefix Fine-Tuning (UPFT), which leverages the observation of Prefix Self-Consistency -- the shared initial reasoning steps across diverse solution trajectories -- to enhance LLM reasoning efficiency. By training exclusively on the initial prefix substrings (as few as 8 tokens), UPFT removes the need for labeled data or exhaustive sampling. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that UPFT matches the performance of supervised methods such as Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning, while reducing training time by 75% and sampling cost by 99%. Further analysis reveals that errors tend to appear in later stages of the reasoning process and that prefix-based training preserves the model's structural knowledge. This work demonstrates how minimal unsupervised fine-tuning can unlock substantial reasoning gains in LLMs, offering a scalable and resource-efficient alternative to conventional approaches.|Ke Ji et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02875)|null|

Though intuitive, text-based instructions suffer from natural languages' ambiguous and redundant nature. To address the issue, researchers have explored augmenting text-based instructions with interactions that facilitate precise and effective human intent expression, such as direct manipulation. However, the design strategy of interaction-augmented instructions lacks systematic investigation, hindering our understanding and application. To provide a panorama of interaction-augmented instructions, we propose a framework to analyze related tools from why, when, who, what, and how interactions are applied to augment text-based instructions. Notably, we identify four purposes for applying interactions, including restricting, expanding, organizing, and refining text instructions. The design paradigms for each purpose are also summarized to benefit future researchers and practitioners.|Leixian Shen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02874)|null|

In addition, FairSense-AI integrates an AI risk assessment component that aligns with frameworks like the MIT AI Risk Repository and NIST AI Risk Management Framework, enabling structured identification of ethical and safety concerns. The platform is optimized for energy efficiency via techniques such as model pruning and mixed-precision computation, thereby reducing its environmental footprint.

|**2025-03-04**|**Calibrating LLM Confidence with Semantic Steering: A Multi-Prompt Aggregation Framework**|Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit misaligned confidence scores, usually overestimating the reliability of their predictions. While verbalized confidence in Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention, prior work remains divided on whether confidence scores can be systematically steered through prompting. Recent studies even argue that such prompt-induced confidence shifts are negligible, suggesting LLMs' confidence calibration is rigid to linguistic interventions. Contrary to these claims, we first rigorously confirm the existence of directional confidence shifts by probing three models (including GPT3.5, LLAMA3-70b, GPT4) across 7 benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit instructions can inflate or deflate confidence scores in a regulated manner. Based on this observation, we propose a novel framework containing three components: confidence steering, steered confidence aggregation and steered answers selection, named SteeringConf. Our method, SteeringConf, leverages a confidence manipulation mechanism to steer the confidence scores of LLMs in several desired directions, followed by a summarization module that aggregates the steered confidence scores to produce a final prediction. We evaluate our method on 7 benchmarks and it consistently outperforms the baselines in terms of calibration metrics in task of confidence calibration and failure detection.|Ziang Zhou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02863)|null|
|**2025-03-04**|**Privacy and Accuracy-Aware AI/ML Model Deduplication**|With the growing adoption of privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms, such as Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), training or fine-tuning models on private datasets has become increasingly prevalent. This shift has led to the need for models offering varying privacy guarantees and utility levels to satisfy diverse user requirements. However, managing numerous versions of large models introduces significant operational challenges, including increased inference latency, higher resource consumption, and elevated costs. Model deduplication is a technique widely used by many model serving and database systems to support high-performance and low-cost inference queries and model diagnosis queries. However, none of the existing model deduplication works has considered privacy, leading to unbounded aggregation of privacy costs for certain deduplicated models and inefficiencies when applied to deduplicate DP-trained models. We formalize the problems of deduplicating DP-trained models for the first time and propose a novel privacy- and accuracy-aware deduplication mechanism to address the problems. We developed a greedy strategy to select and assign base models to target models to minimize storage and privacy costs. When deduplicating a target model, we dynamically schedule accuracy validations and apply the Sparse Vector Technique to reduce the privacy costs associated with private validation data. Compared to baselines that do not provide privacy guarantees, our approach improved the compression ratio by up to $35\times$ for individual models (including large language models and vision transformers). We also observed up to $43\times$ inference speedup due to the reduction of I/O operations.|Hong Guan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02862)|null|
|**2025-03-04**|**Shakespearean Sparks: The Dance of Hallucination and Creativity in LLMs' Decoding Layers**|Large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, a phenomenon often linked to creativity. While previous research has primarily explored this connection through theoretical or qualitative lenses, our work takes a quantitative approach to systematically examine the relationship between hallucination and creativity in LLMs. Given the complex nature of creativity, we propose a narrow definition tailored to LLMs and introduce an evaluation framework, HCL, which quantifies Hallucination and Creativity across different Layers of LLMs during decoding. Our empirical analysis reveals a tradeoff between hallucination and creativity that is consistent across layer depth, model type, and model size. Notably, across different model architectures, we identify a specific layer at each model size that optimally balances this tradeoff. Additionally, the optimal layer tends to appear in the early layers of larger models, and the confidence of the model is also significantly higher at this layer. These findings provide a quantitative perspective that offers new insights into the interplay between LLM creativity and hallucination.

|**2025-03-04**|**Mask-DPO: Generalizable Fine-grained Factuality Alignment of LLMs**|Large language models (LLMs) exhibit hallucinations (i.e., unfaithful or nonsensical information) when serving as AI assistants in various domains. Since hallucinations always come with truthful content in the LLM responses, previous factuality alignment methods that conduct response-level preference learning inevitably introduced noises during training. Therefore, this paper proposes a fine-grained factuality alignment method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), called Mask-DPO. Incorporating sentence-level factuality as mask signals, Mask-DPO only learns from factually correct sentences in the preferred samples and prevents the penalty on factual contents in the not preferred samples, which resolves the ambiguity in the preference learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Mask-DPO can significantly improve the factuality of LLMs responses to questions from both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, although these questions and their corresponding topics are unseen during training. Only trained on the ANAH train set, the score of Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on the ANAH test set is improved from 49.19% to 77.53%, even surpassing the score of Llama3.1-70B-Instruct (53.44%), while its FactScore on the out-of-domain Biography dataset is also improved from 30.29% to 39.39%. We further study the generalization property of Mask-DPO using different training sample scaling strategies and find that scaling the number of topics in the dataset is more effective than the number of questions. We provide a hypothesis of what factual alignment is doing with LLMs, on the implication of this phenomenon, and conduct proof-of-concept experiments to verify it. We hope the method and the findings pave the way for future research on scaling factuality alignment.|Yuzhe Gu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02846)|null|
|**2025-03-04**|**AlignDistil: Token-Level Language Model Alignment as Adaptive Policy Distillation**|In modern large language models (LLMs), LLM alignment is of crucial importance and is typically achieved through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization.|Songming Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02832)|null|
|**2025-02-28**|**LLM Post-Training: A Deep Dive into Reasoning Large Language Models**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the natural language processing landscape and brought to life diverse applications. Pretraining on vast web-scale data has laid the foundation for these models, yet the research community is now increasingly shifting focus toward post-training techniques to achieve further breakthroughs. While pretraining provides a broad linguistic foundation, post-training methods enable LLMs to refine their knowledge, improve reasoning, enhance factual accuracy, and align more effectively with user intents and ethical considerations. Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time scaling have emerged as critical strategies for optimizing LLMs performance, ensuring robustness, and improving adaptability across various real-world tasks. This survey provides a systematic exploration of post-training methodologies, analyzing their role in refining LLMs beyond pretraining, addressing key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, reward hacking, and inference-time trade-offs. We highlight emerging directions in model alignment, scalable adaptation, and inference-time reasoning, and outline future research directions. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Awesome-LLM-Post-training.|Komal Kumar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21321)|null|

However, the potential flaws of periodicity modeling in Transformer affect the learning efficiency and establishment of underlying principles from data for large language models (LLMs) built upon it. In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating effective periodicity modeling can improve the learning efficiency and performance of LLMs. We introduce FANformer, which integrates Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) into attention mechanism to achieve efficient periodicity modeling, by modifying the feature projection process of attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results on language modeling show that FANformer consistently outperforms Transformer when scaling up model size and training tokens, underscoring its superior learning efficiency. To further validate the effectiveness of FANformer, we pretrain a FANformer-1B on 1 trillion tokens. FANformer-1B exhibits marked improvements on downstream tasks compared to open-source LLMs with similar model parameters or training tokens. The results position FANformer as an effective and promising architecture for advancing LLMs.|Yihong Dong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21309)|null|
|**2025-02-28**|**Contextualizing biological perturbation experiments through language**|High-content perturbation experiments allow scientists to probe biomolecular systems at unprecedented resolution, but experimental and analysis costs pose significant barriers to widespread adoption. Machine learning has the potential to guide efficient exploration of the perturbation space and extract novel insights from these data. However, current approaches neglect the semantic richness of the relevant biology, and their objectives are misaligned with downstream biological analyses. In this paper, we hypothesize that large language models (LLMs) present a natural medium for representing complex biological relationships and rationalizing experimental outcomes. We propose PerturbQA, a benchmark for structured reasoning over perturbation experiments. Unlike current benchmarks that primarily interrogate existing knowledge, PerturbQA is inspired by open problems in perturbation modeling: prediction of differential expression and change of direction for unseen perturbations, and gene set enrichment. We evaluate state-of-the-art machine learning and statistical approaches for modeling perturbations, as well as standard LLM reasoning strategies, and we find that current methods perform poorly on PerturbQA. As a proof of feasibility, we introduce Summer (SUMMarize, retrievE, and answeR, a simple, domain-informed LLM framework that matches or exceeds the current state-of-the-art.

|**2025-02-28**|**Adaptive Keyframe Sampling for Long Video Understanding**|Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled open-world visual understanding by injecting visual input as extra tokens into large language models (LLMs) as contexts. However, when the visual input changes from a single image to a long video, the above paradigm encounters difficulty because the vast amount of video tokens has significantly exceeded the maximal capacity of MLLMs. Therefore, existing video-based MLLMs are mostly established upon sampling a small portion of tokens from input data, which can cause key information to be lost and thus produce incorrect answers. This paper presents a simple yet effective algorithm named Adaptive Keyframe Sampling (AKS). It inserts a plug-and-play module known as keyframe selection, which aims to maximize the useful information with a fixed number of video tokens. We formulate keyframe selection as an optimization involving (1) the relevance between the keyframes and the prompt, and (2) the coverage of the keyframes over the video, and present an adaptive algorithm to approximate the best solution. Experiments on two long video understanding benchmarks validate that Adaptive Keyframe Sampling improves video QA accuracy (beyond strong baselines) upon selecting informative keyframes. Our study reveals the importance of information pre-filtering in video-based MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/ncTimTang/AKS.|Xi Tang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21271)|null|
|**2025-02-28**|**Token-level Ensembling of Models with Different Vocabularies**|Model ensembling is a technique to combine the predicted distributions of two or more models, often leading to improved robustness and performance. For ensembling in text generation, the next token's probability distribution is derived from a weighted sum of the distributions of each individual model. This requires the underlying models to share the same subword vocabulary, limiting the applicability of ensembling, since many open-sourced models have distinct vocabularies. In research settings, experimentation or upgrades to vocabularies may introduce multiple vocabulary sizes. This paper proposes an inference-time only algorithm that allows for ensembling models with different vocabularies, without the need to learn additional parameters or alter the underlying models. Instead, the algorithm ensures that tokens generated by the ensembled models \textit{agree} in their surface form. We apply this technique to combinations of traditional encoder-decoder models and decoder-only LLMs and evaluate on machine translation. In addition to expanding to model pairs that were previously incapable of token-level ensembling, our algorithm frequently improves translation performance over either model individually.|Rachel Wicks et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21265)|null|

We present a new dataset for ICD coding, which includes diagnosis fields from electronic health records (EHRs) annotated with over 10,000 entities and more than 1,500 unique ICD codes. This dataset serves as a benchmark for several state-of-the-art models, including BERT, LLaMA with LoRA, and RAG, with additional experiments examining transfer learning across domains (from PubMed abstracts to medical diagnosis) and terminologies (from UMLS concepts to ICD codes). We then apply the best-performing model to label an in-house EHR dataset containing patient histories from 2017 to 2021. Our experiments, conducted on a carefully curated test set, demonstrate that training with the automated predicted codes leads to a significant improvement in accuracy compared to manually annotated data from physicians. We believe our findings offer valuable insights into the potential for automating clinical coding in resource-limited languages like Russian, which could enhance clinical efficiency and data accuracy in these contexts.|Aleksandr Nesterov et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21263)|null|
|**2025-02-28**|**RoboBrain: A Unified Brain Model for Robotic Manipulation from Abstract to Concrete**|Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various multimodal contexts. However, their application in robotic scenarios, particularly for long-horizon manipulation tasks, reveals significant limitations. These limitations arise from the current MLLMs lacking three essential robotic brain capabilities: Planning Capability, which involves decomposing complex manipulation instructions into manageable sub-tasks; Affordance Perception, the ability to recognize and interpret the affordances of interactive objects; and Trajectory Prediction, the foresight to anticipate the complete manipulation trajectory necessary for successful execution. To enhance the robotic brain's core capabilities from abstract to concrete, we introduce ShareRobot, a high-quality heterogeneous dataset that labels multi-dimensional information such as task planning, object affordance, and end-effector trajectory. ShareRobot's diversity and accuracy have been meticulously refined by three human annotators. Building on this dataset, we developed RoboBrain, an MLLM-based model that combines robotic and general multi-modal data, utilizes a multi-stage training strategy, and incorporates long videos and high-resolution images to improve its robotic manipulation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance across various robotic tasks, highlighting its potential to advance robotic brain capabilities.|Yuheng Ji et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21257)|null|
|**2025-02-28**|**Semantic Volume: Quantifying and Detecting both External and Internal Uncertainty in LLMs**|Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks by encoding vast amounts of factual knowledge. However, they are still prone to hallucinations, generating incorrect or misleading information, often accompanied by high uncertainty. Existing methods for hallucination detection primarily focus on quantifying internal uncertainty, which arises from missing or conflicting knowledge within the model. However, hallucinations can also stem from external uncertainty, where ambiguous user queries lead to multiple possible interpretations. In this work, we introduce Semantic Volume, a novel mathematical measure for quantifying both external and internal uncertainty in LLMs. Our approach perturbs queries and responses, embeds them in a semantic space, and computes the determinant of the Gram matrix of the embedding vectors, capturing their dispersion as a measure of uncertainty. Our framework provides a generalizable and unsupervised uncertainty detection method without requiring white-box access to LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on both external and internal uncertainty detection, demonstrating that our Semantic Volume method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both tasks. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights linking our measure to differential entropy, unifying and extending previous sampling-based uncertainty measures such as the semantic entropy. Semantic Volume is shown to be a robust and interpretable approach to improving the reliability of LLMs by systematically detecting uncertainty in both user queries and model responses.|Xiaomin Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21239)|null|

In these regions, limited healthcare access and high patient-to-provider ratios impede effective patient support, communication, and treatment completion. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating a specialized Large Language Model into an efficacious digital adherence technology to augment interactive communication with treatment supporters.

|**2025-02-28**|**ByteScale: Efficient Scaling of LLM Training with a 2048K Context Length on More Than 12,000 GPUs**|Scaling long-context ability is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs). To amortize the memory consumption across multiple devices in long-context training, inter-data partitioning (a.k.a. Data Parallelism) and intra-data partitioning (a.k.a. Context Parallelism) are commonly used. Current training frameworks predominantly treat the two techniques as orthogonal, and establish static communication groups to organize the devices as a static mesh (e.g., a 2D mesh). However, the sequences for LLM training typically vary in lengths, no matter for texts, multi-modalities or reinforcement learning. The mismatch between data heterogeneity and static mesh causes redundant communication and imbalanced computation, degrading the training efficiency.   In this work, we introduce ByteScale, an efficient, flexible, and scalable LLM training framework for large-scale mixed training of long and short sequences. The core of ByteScale is a novel parallelism strategy, namely Hybrid Data Parallelism (HDP), which unifies the inter- and intra-data partitioning with a dynamic mesh design. In particular, we build a communication optimizer, which eliminates the redundant communication for short sequences by data-aware sharding and dynamic communication, and further compresses the communication cost for long sequences by selective offloading. Besides, we also develop a balance scheduler to mitigate the imbalanced computation by parallelism-aware data assignment. We evaluate ByteScale with the model sizes ranging from 7B to 141B, context lengths from 256K to 2048K, on a production cluster with more than 12,000 GPUs. Experiment results show that ByteScale outperforms the state-of-the-art training system by up to 7.89x.|Hao Ge et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21231)|null|
|**2025-02-27**|**R2-T2: Re-Routing in Test-Time for Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts**|In large multimodal models (LMMs), the perception of non-language modalities (e.g., visual representations) is usually not on par with the large language models (LLMs)' powerful reasoning capabilities, deterring LMMs' performance on challenging downstream tasks. This weakness has been recently mitigated by replacing the vision encoder with a mixture-of-experts (MoE), which provides rich, multi-granularity, and diverse representations required by diverse downstream tasks. The performance of multimodal MoE largely depends on its router, which reweights and mixes the representations of different experts for each input. However, we find that the end-to-end trained router does not always produce the optimal routing weights for every test sample. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel and efficient method "Re-Routing in Test-Time(R2-T2) that locally optimizes the vector of routing weights in test-time by moving it toward those vectors of the correctly predicted samples in a neighborhood of the test sample. We propose three R2-T2 strategies with different optimization objectives and neighbor-search spaces. R2-T2 consistently and greatly improves state-of-the-art LMMs' performance on challenging benchmarks of diverse tasks, without training any base-model parameters.|Zhongyang Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20395)|null|
|**2025-02-27**|**Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A Security Analysis**|Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging research shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same safety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the greater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may expose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold that addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this disparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals - nuances that simple evaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle these challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular, systematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we identify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI agents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action generation, and (3) observational capabilities. Our findings highlights the pressing need to enhance security and robustness in AI agent design and provide actionable insights for targeted defense strategies.|Jeffrey Yang Fan Chiang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20383)|null|
|**2025-02-27**|**Multi-Agent Verification: Scaling Test-Time Compute with Multiple Verifiers**|By utilizing more computational resources at test-time, large language models (LLMs) can improve without additional training. One common strategy uses verifiers to evaluate candidate outputs. In this work, we propose a novel scaling dimension for test-time compute: scaling the number of verifiers. We introduce Multi-Agent Verification (MAV) as a test-time compute paradigm that combines multiple verifiers to improve performance. We propose using Aspect Verifiers (AVs), off-the-shelf LLMs prompted to verify different aspects of outputs, as one possible choice for the verifiers in a MAV system. AVs are a convenient building block for MAV since they can be easily combined without additional training. Moreover, we introduce BoN-MAV, a simple multi-agent verification algorithm that combines best-of-n sampling with multiple verifiers. BoN-MAV demonstrates stronger scaling patterns than self-consistency and reward model verification, and we demonstrate both weak-to-strong generalization, where combining weak verifiers improves even stronger LLMs, and self-improvement, where the same base model is used to both generate and verify outputs. Our results establish scaling the number of verifiers as a promising new dimension for improving language model performance at test-time.|Shalev Lifshitz et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20379)|null|
|**2025-02-27**|**PhantomWiki: On-Demand Datasets for Reasoning and Retrieval Evaluation**|High-quality benchmarks are essential for evaluating reasoning and retrieval capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, curating datasets for this purpose is not a permanent solution as they are prone to data leakage and inflated performance results. To address these challenges, we propose PhantomWiki: a pipeline to generate unique, factually consistent document corpora with diverse question-answer pairs. Unlike prior work, PhantomWiki is neither a fixed dataset, nor is it based on any existing data. Instead, a new PhantomWiki instance is generated on demand for each evaluation. We vary the question difficulty and corpus size to disentangle reasoning and retrieval capabilities respectively, and find that PhantomWiki datasets are surprisingly challenging for frontier LLMs. Thus, we contribute a scalable and data leakage-resistant framework for disentangled evaluation of reasoning, retrieval, and tool-use abilities.

This technology excels at inferring relationships within vast unstructured or semi-structured datasets. The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. Extracting insights and navigating the intricate networks of legal documents and their relations is crucial for effective legal research. Here, we introduce a generative AI system that integrates RAG, VS, and KG, constructed via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to enhance legal information retrieval and AI reasoning and minimize hallucinations. In the legal system, these technologies empower AI agents to identify and analyze complex connections among cases, statutes, and legal precedents, uncovering hidden relationships and predicting legal trends-challenging tasks that are essential for ensuring justice and improving operational efficiency. Our system employs web scraping techniques to systematically collect legal texts, such as statutes, constitutional provisions, and case law, from publicly accessible platforms like Justia. It bridges the gap between traditional keyword-based searches and contextual understanding by leveraging advanced semantic representations, hierarchical relationships, and latent topic discovery. This framework supports legal document clustering, summarization, and cross-referencing, for scalable, interpretable, and accurate retrieval for semi-structured data while advancing computational law and AI.|Ryan C.

(2023)'s influential work on the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest (NYCCC). Their study exposed a substantial gap between LLMs and humans in humor comprehension, establishing that understanding and evaluating creative content is key challenge in AI development. We revisit this challenge by decomposing humor understanding into three components and systematically improve each: enhancing visual understanding through improved annotation, utilizing LLM-generated humor reasoning and explanations, and implementing targeted alignment with human preference data. Our refined approach achieves 82.4% accuracy in caption ranking, singificantly improving upon the previous 67% benchmark and matching the performance of world-renowned human experts in this domain. Notably, while attempts to mimic subgroup preferences through various persona prompts showed minimal impact, model finetuning with crowd preferences proved remarkably effective. These findings reveal that LLM limitations in creative judgment can be effectively addressed through focused alignment to specific subgroups and individuals. Lastly, we propose the position that achieving artificial general intelligence necessitates systematic collection of human preference data across creative domains. We advocate that just as human creativity is deeply influenced by individual and cultural preferences, training LLMs with diverse human preference data may be essential for developing true creative understanding.|Kuan Lok Zhou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20356)|null|

Although LLMs possess impressive capabilities, their internal mechanisms for processing and representing linguistic knowledge remain largely opaque. Previous work on linguistic mechanisms has been limited by coarse granularity, insufficient causal analysis, and a narrow focus. In this study, we present a systematic and comprehensive causal investigation using sparse auto-encoders (SAEs). We extract a wide range of linguistic features from six dimensions: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. We extract, evaluate, and intervene on these features by constructing minimal contrast datasets and counterfactual sentence datasets. We introduce two indices-Feature Representation Confidence (FRC) and Feature Intervention Confidence (FIC)-to measure the ability of linguistic features to capture and control linguistic phenomena. Our results reveal inherent representations of linguistic knowledge in LLMs and demonstrate the potential for controlling model outputs. This work provides strong evidence that LLMs possess genuine linguistic knowledge and lays the foundation for more interpretable and controllable language modeling in future research.|Yi Jing et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20344)|null|
|**2025-02-27**|**Thinking Slow, Fast: Scaling Inference Compute with Distilled Reasoners**|Recent advancements have demonstrated that the performance of large language models (LLMs) can be significantly enhanced by scaling computational resources at test time. A common strategy involves generating multiple Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories and aggregating their outputs through various selection mechanisms. This raises a fundamental question: can models with lower complexity leverage their superior generation throughput to outperform similarly sized Transformers for a fixed computational budget? To address this question and overcome the lack of strong subquadratic reasoners, we distill pure and hybrid Mamba models from pretrained Transformers. Trained on only 8 billion tokens, our distilled models show strong performance and scaling on mathematical reasoning datasets while being much faster at inference for large batches and long sequences. Despite the zero-shot performance hit due to distillation, both pure and hybrid Mamba models can scale their coverage and accuracy performance past their Transformer teacher models under fixed time budgets, opening a new direction for scaling inference compute.|Daniele Paliotta et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20339)|null|
|**2025-02-27**|**Expertise Is What We Want**|Clinical decision-making depends on expert reasoning, which is guided by standardized, evidence-based guidelines. However, translating these guidelines into automated clinical decision support systems risks inaccuracy and importantly, loss of nuance. We share an application architecture, the Large Language Expert (LLE), that combines the flexibility and power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the interpretability, explainability, and reliability of Expert Systems. LLMs help address key challenges of Expert Systems, such as integrating and codifying knowledge, and data normalization. Conversely, an Expert System-like approach helps overcome challenges with LLMs, including hallucinations, atomic and inexpensive updates, and testability.   To highlight the power of the Large Language Expert (LLE) system, we built an LLE to assist with the workup of patients newly diagnosed with cancer. Timely initiation of cancer treatment is critical for optimal patient outcomes. However, increasing complexity in diagnostic recommendations has made it difficult for primary care physicians to ensure their patients have completed the necessary workup before their first visit with an oncologist. As with many real-world clinical tasks, these workups require the analysis of unstructured health records and the application of nuanced clinical decision logic. In this study, we describe the design & evaluation of an LLE system built to rapidly identify and suggest the correct diagnostic workup. The system demonstrated a high degree of clinical-level accuracy (>95%) and effectively addressed gaps identified in real-world data from breast and colon cancer patients at a large academic center.|Alan Ashworth et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20335)|null|
|**2025-02-26**|**Norm Growth and Stability Challenges in Localized Sequential Knowledge Editing**|This study investigates the impact of localized updates to large language models (LLMs), specifically in the context of knowledge editing - a task aimed at incorporating or modifying specific facts without altering broader model capabilities. We first show that across different post-training interventions like continuous pre-training, full fine-tuning and LORA-based fine-tuning, the Frobenius norm of the updated matrices always increases. This increasing norm is especially detrimental for localized knowledge editing, where only a subset of matrices are updated in a model . We reveal a consistent phenomenon across various editing techniques, including fine-tuning, hypernetwork-based approaches, and locate-and-edit methods: the norm of the updated matrix invariably increases with successive updates. Such growth disrupts model balance, particularly when isolated matrices are updated while the rest of the model remains static, leading to potential instability and degradation of downstream performance. Upon deeper investigations of the intermediate activation vectors, we find that the norm of internal activations decreases and is accompanied by shifts in the subspaces occupied by these activations, which shows that these activation vectors now occupy completely different regions in the representation space compared to the unedited model. With our paper, we highlight the technical challenges with continuous and localized sequential knowledge editing and their implications for maintaining model stability and utility.|Akshat Gupta et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19416)|null|
|**2025-02-26**|**Project Alexandria: Towards Freeing Scientific Knowledge from Copyright Burdens via LLMs**|Paywalls, licenses and copyright rules often restrict the broad dissemination and reuse of scientific knowledge. We take the position that it is both legally and technically feasible to extract the scientific knowledge in scholarly texts. Current methods, like text embeddings, fail to reliably preserve factual content, and simple paraphrasing may not be legally sound. We urge the community to adopt a new idea: convert scholarly documents into Knowledge Units using LLMs. These units use structured data capturing entities, attributes and relationships without stylistic content. We provide evidence that Knowledge Units: (1) form a legally defensible framework for sharing knowledge from copyrighted research texts, based on legal analyses of German copyright law and U.S. Fair Use doctrine, and (2) preserve most (~95%) factual knowledge from original text, measured by MCQ performance on facts from the original copyrighted text across four research domains. Freeing scientific knowledge from copyright promises transformative benefits for scientific research and education by allowing language models to reuse important facts from copyrighted text. To support this, we share open-source tools for converting research documents into Knowledge Units. Overall, our work posits the feasibility of democratizing access to scientific knowledge while respecting copyright.|Christoph Schuhmann et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19413)|null|

In this study, we examine how code serves as a structured medium for enhancing reasoning: it provides verifiable execution paths, enforces logical decomposition, and enables runtime validation. We also explore how improvements in reasoning have transformed code intelligence from basic completion to advanced capabilities, enabling models to address complex software engineering tasks through planning and debugging.

|**2025-02-26**|**Less or More: Towards Glanceable Explanations for LLM Recommendations Using Ultra-Small Devices**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in recommending everyday actions as personal AI assistants, while Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are being increasingly utilized to help users understand why a recommendation is given. Personal AI assistants today are often located on ultra-small devices such as smartwatches, which have limited screen space. The verbosity of LLM-generated explanations, however, makes it challenging to deliver glanceable LLM explanations on such ultra-small devices. To address this, we explored 1) spatially structuring an LLM's explanation text using defined contextual components during prompting and 2) presenting temporally adaptive explanations to users based on confidence levels. We conducted a user study to understand how these approaches impacted user experiences when interacting with LLM recommendations and explanations on ultra-small devices. The results showed that structured explanations reduced users' time to action and cognitive load when reading an explanation. Always-on structured explanations increased users' acceptance of AI recommendations. However, users were less satisfied with structured explanations compared to unstructured ones due to their lack of sufficient, readable details. Additionally, adaptively presenting structured explanations was less effective at improving user perceptions of the AI compared to the always-on structured explanations. Together with users' interview feedback, the results led to design implications to be mindful of when personalizing the content and timing of LLM explanations that are displayed on ultra-small devices.|Xinru Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19410)|null|

While recent models incorporate multi-image data during pre-training, they still struggle to recognize sequential structures, often treating images independently. This work introduces ImageChain, a framework that enhances MLLMs with sequential reasoning capabilities over image data by modeling visual sequences as a multi-turn conversation. In ImageChain, images are interleaved with corresponding textual descriptions to form a controlled dialogue that explicitly captures temporal dependencies and narrative progression. Our method optimizes for the task of next-scene description, where the model generates a context-aware description of an upcoming scene based on preceding visual and textual cues. We demonstrate that our approach improves performance on the next-scene description task -- achieving an average improvement from 3.7% to 19% in SimRate, a metric that quantifies semantic similarity to human-annotated ground truths. Moreover, ImageChain achieves robust zero-shot out-of-domain performance in applications ranging from comics to robotics. Extensive experiments validate that instruction-tuning in a multimodal, multi-turn conversation design is key to bridging the gap between static image understanding and temporally-aware reasoning.|Danae Sánchez Villegas et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19409)|null|
|**2025-02-26**|**Learning Code-Edit Embedding to Model Student Debugging Behavior**|Providing effective feedback for programming assignments in computer science education can be challenging: students solve problems by iteratively submitting code, executing it, and using limited feedback from the compiler or the auto-grader to debug. Analyzing student debugging behavior in this process may reveal important insights into their knowledge and inform better personalized support tools. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder-based model that learns meaningful code-edit embeddings between consecutive student code submissions, to capture their debugging behavior. Our model leverages information on whether a student code submission passes each test case to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to learn code editing representations. It enables personalized next-step code suggestions that maintain the student's coding style while improving test case correctness. Our model also enables us to analyze student code-editing patterns to uncover common student errors and debugging behaviors, using clustering techniques. Experimental results on a real-world student code submission dataset demonstrate that our model excels at code reconstruction and personalized code suggestion while revealing interesting patterns in student debugging behavior.|Hasnain Heickal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19407)|null|
|**2025-02-26**|**Verde: Verification via Refereed Delegation for Machine Learning Programs**|Machine learning programs, such as those performing inference, fine-tuning, and training of LLMs, are commonly delegated to untrusted compute providers. To provide correctness guarantees for the client, we propose adapting the cryptographic notion of refereed delegation to the machine learning setting. This approach enables a computationally limited client to delegate a program to multiple untrusted compute providers, with a guarantee of obtaining the correct result if at least one of them is honest. Refereed delegation of ML programs poses two technical hurdles: (1) an arbitration protocol to resolve disputes when compute providers disagree on the output, and (2) the ability to bitwise reproduce ML programs across different hardware setups, For (1), we design Verde, a dispute arbitration protocol that efficiently handles the large scale and graph-based computational model of modern ML programs. For (2), we build RepOps (Reproducible Operators), a library that eliminates hardware "non-determinism" by controlling the order of floating point operations performed on all hardware. Our implementation shows that refereed delegation achieves both strong guarantees for clients and practical overheads for compute providers.|Arasu Arun et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19405)|null|
|**2025-02-26**|**General Reasoning Requires Learning to Reason from the Get-go**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive real-world utility, exemplifying artificial useful intelligence (AUI). However, their ability to reason adaptively and robustly -- the hallmarks of artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- remains fragile. While LLMs seemingly succeed in commonsense reasoning, programming, and mathematics, they struggle to generalize algorithmic understanding across novel contexts. Our experiments with algorithmic tasks in esoteric programming languages reveal that LLM's reasoning overfits to the training data and is limited in its transferability. We hypothesize that the core issue underlying such limited transferability is the coupling of reasoning and knowledge in LLMs.   To transition from AUI to AGI, we propose disentangling knowledge and reasoning through three key directions: (1) pretaining to reason using RL from scratch as an alternative to the widely used next-token prediction pretraining, (2) using a curriculum of synthetic tasks to ease the learning of a \textit{reasoning prior} for RL that can then be transferred to natural language tasks, and (3) learning more generalizable reasoning functions using a small context window to reduce exploiting spurious correlations between tokens. Such a reasoning system coupled with a trained retrieval system and a large external memory bank as a knowledge store can overcome several limitations of existing architectures at learning to reason in novel scenarios.|Seungwook Han et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19402)|null|

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in text-based theorem reasoning, their ability to generate coherent and pedagogically meaningful visual explanations remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce TheoremExplainAgent, an agentic approach for generating long-form theorem explanation videos (over 5 minutes) using Manim animations. To systematically evaluate multimodal theorem explanations, we propose TheoremExplainBench, a benchmark covering 240 theorems across multiple STEM disciplines, along with 5 automated evaluation metrics. Our results reveal that agentic planning is essential for generating detailed long-form videos, and the o3-mini agent achieves a success rate of 93.8% and an overall score of 0.77. However, our quantitative and qualitative studies show that most of the videos produced exhibit minor issues with visual element layout. Furthermore, multimodal explanations expose deeper reasoning flaws that text-based explanations fail to reveal, highlighting the importance of multimodal explanations.|Max Ku et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19400)|null|
|**2025-02-26**|**HDEE: Heterogeneous Domain Expert Ensemble**|Training dense LLMs requires enormous amounts of data and centralized compute, which introduces fundamental bottlenecks and ever-growing costs for large models. Several studies aim to reduce this dependency on centralization by reducing the communication overhead of training dense models. Taking this idea of reducing communication overhead to a natural extreme, by training embarrassingly parallelizable ensembles of small independent experts, has been shown to outperform large dense models trained in traditional centralized settings. However, existing studies do not take into account underlying differences amongst data domains and treat them as monolithic, regardless of their underlying complexity, size, or distribution. In this paper, we explore the effects of introducing heterogeneity to these ensembles of domain expert models. Specifically, by allowing models within the ensemble to vary in size--as well as the number of training steps taken depending on the training data's domain--we study the effect heterogeneity has on these ensembles when evaluated against domains included in, and excluded from, the training set. We use the same compute budget to train heterogeneous ensembles and homogeneous baselines for comparison. We show that the heterogeneous ensembles achieve the lowest perplexity scores in $20$ out of the $21$ data domains used in the evaluation.

|**2025-02-25**|**DRAMA: Diverse Augmentation from Large Language Models to Smaller Dense Retrievers**|Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong effectiveness and robustness while fine-tuned as dense retrievers. However, their large parameter size brings significant inference time computational challenges, including high encoding costs for large-scale corpora and increased query latency, limiting their practical deployment. While smaller retrievers offer better efficiency, they often fail to generalize effectively with limited supervised fine-tuning data. In this work, we introduce DRAMA, a training framework that leverages LLMs to train smaller generalizable dense retrievers. In particular, we adopt pruned LLMs as the backbone and train on diverse LLM-augmented data in a single-stage contrastive learning setup. Experiments show that DRAMA offers better multilingual and long-context capabilities than traditional encoder-based retrievers, and achieves strong performance across multiple tasks and languages. These highlight the potential of connecting the training of smaller retrievers with the growing advancements in LLMs, bridging the gap between efficiency and generalization.|Xueguang Ma et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18460)|null|

In this paper, we present a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models to automatically identify design pattern instances across diverse codebases. Our method focuses on recognizing the roles classes play within the pattern instances. By providing clearer insights into software structure and intent, this research aims to support developers, improve comprehension, and streamline tasks such as refactoring, maintenance, and adherence to best practices.|Christian Schindler et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18458)|null|

Analyzing Synthetic Data Effectiveness in Object-Based Common Sense Reasoning for Disaster Response**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential for substantial common sense reasoning. However, these capabilities are often emergent in larger models. This means smaller models that can be run locally are less helpful and capable with respect to certain reasoning tasks. To meet our problem space requirements, we fine-tune smaller LLMs to disaster domains, as these domains involve complex and low-frequency physical common sense knowledge. We introduce a pipeline to create Field Ready Instruction Decoding Agent (FRIDA) models, where domain experts and linguists combine their knowledge to make high-quality seed data that is used to generate synthetic data for fine-tuning. We create a set of 130 seed instructions for synthetic generation, a synthetic dataset of 25000 instructions, and 119 evaluation instructions relating to both general and earthquake-specific object affordances. We fine-tune several LLaMa and Mistral instruction-tuned models and find that FRIDA models outperform their base models at a variety of sizes. We then run an ablation study to understand which kinds of synthetic data most affect performance and find that training physical state and object function common sense knowledge alone improves over FRIDA models trained on all data. We conclude that the FRIDA pipeline is capable of instilling general common sense, but needs to be augmented with information retrieval for specific domain knowledge.|Mollie Shichman et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18452)|null|
|**2025-02-25**|**SWE-RL: Advancing LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning on Open Software Evolution**|The recent DeepSeek-R1 release has demonstrated the immense potential of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While DeepSeek-R1 and other follow-up work primarily focus on applying RL to competitive coding and math problems, this paper introduces SWE-RL, the first approach to scale RL-based LLM reasoning for real-world software engineering. Leveraging a lightweight rule-based reward (e.g., the similarity score between ground-truth and LLM-generated solutions), SWE-RL enables LLMs to autonomously recover a developer's reasoning processes and solutions by learning from extensive open-source software evolution data -- the record of a software's entire lifecycle, including its code snapshots, code changes, and events such as issues and pull requests. Trained on top of Llama 3, our resulting reasoning model, Llama3-SWE-RL-70B, achieves a 41.0% solve rate on SWE-bench Verified -- a human-verified collection of real-world GitHub issues. To our knowledge, this is the best performance reported for medium-sized (<100B) LLMs to date, even comparable to leading proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o. Surprisingly, despite performing RL solely on software evolution data, Llama3-SWE-RL has even emerged with generalized reasoning skills. For example, it shows improved results on five out-of-domain tasks, namely, function coding, library use, code reasoning, mathematics, and general language understanding, whereas a supervised-finetuning baseline even leads to performance degradation on average. Overall, SWE-RL opens up a new direction to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through reinforcement learning on massive software engineering data.|Yuxiang Wei et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18449)|null|

We propose a modular approach that resolves ambiguity using natural language interpretations before mapping these to logical forms (e.g., SQL queries). Although LLMs excel at parsing unambiguous utterances, they show strong biases for ambiguous ones, typically predicting only preferred interpretations. We constructively exploit this bias to generate an initial set of preferred disambiguations and then apply a specialized infilling model to identify and generate missing interpretations. To train the infilling model, we introduce an annotation method that uses SQL execution to validate different meanings. Our approach improves interpretation coverage and generalizes across datasets with different annotation styles, database structures, and ambiguity types.|Irina Saparina et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18448)|null|
|**2025-02-25**|**MAPoRL: Multi-Agent Post-Co-Training for Collaborative Large Language Models with Reinforcement Learning**|Leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) to build collaborative multi-agentic workflows has demonstrated significant potential. However, most previous studies focus on prompting the out-of-the-box LLMs, relying on their innate capability for collaboration, which may not improve LLMs' performance as shown recently. In this paper, we introduce a new post-training paradigm MAPoRL (Multi-Agent Post-co-training for collaborative LLMs with Reinforcement Learning), to explicitly elicit the collaborative behaviors and further unleash the power of multi-agentic LLM frameworks. In MAPoRL, multiple LLMs first generate their own responses independently and engage in a multi-turn discussion to collaboratively improve the final answer. In the end, a MAPoRL verifier evaluates both the answer and the discussion, by assigning a score that verifies the correctness of the answer, while adding incentives to encourage corrective and persuasive discussions. The score serves as the co-training reward, and is then maximized through multi-agent RL. Unlike existing LLM post-training paradigms, MAPoRL advocates the co-training of multiple LLMs together using RL for better generalization. Accompanied by analytical insights, our experiments demonstrate that training individual LLMs alone is insufficient to induce effective collaboration. In contrast, multi-agent co-training can boost the collaboration performance across benchmarks, with generalization to unseen domains.|Chanwoo Park et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18439)|null|
|**2025-02-25**|**Reversal Blessing: Thinking Backward May Outpace Thinking Forward in Multi-choice Questions**|Language models usually use left-to-right (L2R) autoregressive factorization. However, L2R factorization may not always be the best inductive bias. Therefore, we investigate whether alternative factorizations of the text distribution could be beneficial in some tasks. We investigate right-to-left (R2L) training as a compelling alternative, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as a test bed for knowledge extraction and reasoning. Through extensive experiments across various model sizes (2B-8B parameters) and training datasets, we find that R2L models can significantly outperform L2R models on several MCQ benchmarks, including logical reasoning, commonsense understanding, and truthfulness assessment tasks. Our analysis reveals that this performance difference may be fundamentally linked to multiple factors including calibration, computability and directional conditional entropy. We ablate the impact of these factors through controlled simulation studies using arithmetic tasks, where the impacting factors can be better disentangled. Our work demonstrates that exploring alternative factorizations of the text distribution can lead to improvements in LLM capabilities and provides theoretical insights into optimal factorization towards approximating human language distribution, and when each reasoning order might be more advantageous.|Yizhe Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18435)|null|

In this paper, we introduce TextGames, an innovative benchmark specifically crafted to assess LLMs through demanding text-based games that require advanced skills in pattern recognition, spatial awareness, arithmetic, and logical reasoning. Our analysis probes LLMs' performance in both single-turn and multi-turn reasoning, and their abilities in leveraging feedback to correct subsequent answers through self-reflection. Our findings reveal that, although LLMs exhibit proficiency in addressing most easy and medium-level problems, they face significant challenges with more difficult tasks. In contrast, humans are capable of solving all tasks when given sufficient time. Moreover, we observe that LLMs show improved performance in multi-turn predictions through self-reflection, yet they still struggle with sequencing, counting, and following complex rules consistently. Additionally, models optimized for reasoning outperform pre-trained LLMs that prioritize instruction following, highlighting the crucial role of reasoning skills in addressing highly complex problems.|Frederikus Hudi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18431)|null|

Rank1 demonstrates the applicability within retrieval of using a reasoning language model (i.e. OpenAI's o1, Deepseek's R1, etc.) for distillation in order to rapidly improve the performance of a smaller model. We gather and open-source a dataset of more than 600,000 examples of R1 reasoning traces from queries and passages in MS MARCO. Models trained on this dataset show: (1) state-of-the-art performance on advanced reasoning and instruction following datasets; (2) work remarkably well out of distribution due to the ability to respond to user-input prompts; and (3) have explainable reasoning chains that can be given to users or RAG-based systems. Further, we demonstrate that quantized versions of these models retain strong performance while using less compute/memory. Overall, Rank1 shows that test-time compute allows for a fundamentally new type of explainable and performant reranker model for search.|Orion Weller et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18418)|null|
|**2025-02-25**|**GLEAN: Generalized Category Discovery with Diverse and Quality-Enhanced LLM Feedback**|Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is a practical and challenging open-world task that aims to recognize both known and novel categories in unlabeled data using limited labeled data from known categories. Due to the lack of supervision, previous GCD methods face significant challenges, such as difficulty in rectifying errors for confusing instances, and inability to effectively uncover and leverage the semantic meanings of discovered clusters. Therefore, additional annotations are usually required for real-world applicability. However, human annotation is extremely costly and inefficient. To address these issues, we propose GLEAN, a unified framework for generalized category discovery that actively learns from diverse and quality-enhanced LLM feedback. Our approach leverages three different types of LLM feedback to: (1) improve instance-level contrastive features, (2) generate category descriptions, and (3) align uncertain instances with LLM-selected category descriptions.

|**2025-02-24**|**Introducing Visual Perception Token into Multimodal Large Language Model**|To utilize visual information, Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) relies on the perception process of its vision encoder. The completeness and accuracy of visual perception significantly influence the precision of spatial reasoning, fine-grained understanding, and other tasks. However, MLLM still lacks the autonomous capability to control its own visual perception processes, for example, selectively reviewing specific regions of an image or focusing on information related to specific object categories. In this work, we propose the concept of Visual Perception Token, aiming to empower MLLM with a mechanism to control its visual perception processes. We design two types of Visual Perception Tokens, termed the Region Selection Token and the Vision Re-Encoding Token. MLLMs autonomously generate these tokens, just as they generate text, and use them to trigger additional visual perception actions. The Region Selection Token explicitly identifies specific regions in an image that require further perception, while the Vision Re-Encoding Token uses its hidden states as control signals to guide additional visual perception processes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of these tokens in handling spatial reasoning, improving fine-grained understanding, and other tasks. On average, the introduction of Visual Perception Tokens improves the performance of a 2B model by 23.6\%, increasing its score from 0.572 to 0.708, and even outperforms a 7B parameter model by 13.4\% (from 0.624).

|**2025-02-24**|**Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs**|We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned.   Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment.   In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger.   It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.|Jan Betley et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424)|**[link](https://github.com/emergent-misalignment/emergent-misalignment)**|

Given their potential integration into many critical applications, it is important to understand the limitations of their visual perception. In this work, we study whether MLLMs can perceive small visual details as effectively as large ones when answering questions about images. We observe that their performance is very sensitive to the size of the visual subject of the question, and further show that this effect is in fact causal by conducting an intervention study. Next, we study the attention patterns of MLLMs when answering visual questions, and intriguingly find that they consistently know where to look, even when they provide the wrong answer. Based on these findings, we then propose training-free visual intervention methods that leverage the internal knowledge of any MLLM itself, in the form of attention and gradient maps, to enhance its perception of small visual details. We evaluate our proposed methods on two widely-used MLLMs and seven visual question answering benchmarks and show that they can significantly improve MLLMs' accuracy without requiring any training. Our results elucidate the risk of applying MLLMs to visual recognition tasks concerning small details and indicate that visual intervention using the model's internal state is a promising direction to mitigate this risk.|Jiarui Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17422)|**[link](https://github.com/saccharomycetes/mllms_know)**|

Despite its promise, the effective application of speculative decoding in LLMs still confronts three key challenges: the increasing memory demands of the draft model, the distribution shift between the short-training corpora and long-context inference, and inefficiencies in attention implementation. In this work, we enhance the performance of speculative decoding in long-context settings by addressing these challenges. First, we propose a memory-efficient draft model with a constant-sized Key-Value (KV) cache. Second, we introduce novel position indices for short-training data, enabling seamless adaptation from short-context training to long-context inference. Finally, we present an innovative attention aggregation method that combines fast implementations for prefix computation with standard attention for tree mask handling, effectively resolving the latency and memory inefficiencies of tree decoding. Our approach achieves strong results on various long-context tasks, including repository-level code completion, long-context summarization, and o1-like long reasoning tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in latency reduction.

Prior work suggests that a single refusal direction in the model's activation space determines whether an LLM refuses a request. In this study, we propose a novel gradient-based approach to representation engineering and use it to identify refusal directions. Contrary to prior work, we uncover multiple independent directions and even multi-dimensional concept cones that mediate refusal. Moreover, we show that orthogonality alone does not imply independence under intervention, motivating the notion of representational independence that accounts for both linear and non-linear effects. Using this framework, we identify mechanistically independent refusal directions. We show that refusal mechanisms in LLMs are governed by complex spatial structures and identify functionally independent directions, confirming that multiple distinct mechanisms drive refusal behavior. Our gradient-based approach uncovers these mechanisms and can further serve as a foundation for future work on understanding LLMs.|Tom Wollschläger et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17420)|null|

While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{https://github.com/zzli2022/Awesome-Slow-Reason-System}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments.

|**2025-02-24**|**Reasoning with Latent Thoughts: On the Power of Looped Transformers**|Large language models have shown remarkable reasoning abilities and scaling laws suggest that large parameter count, especially along the depth axis, is the primary driver. In this work, we make a stronger claim -- many reasoning problems require a large depth but not necessarily many parameters. This unlocks a novel application of looped models for reasoning. Firstly, we show that for many synthetic reasoning problems like addition, $p$-hop induction, and math problems, a $k$-layer transformer looped $L$ times nearly matches the performance of a $kL$-layer non-looped model, and is significantly better than a $k$-layer model. This is further corroborated by theoretical results showing that many such reasoning problems can be solved via iterative algorithms, and thus, can be solved effectively using looped models with nearly optimal depth. Perhaps surprisingly, these benefits also translate to practical settings of language modeling -- on many downstream reasoning tasks, a language model with $k$-layers looped $L$ times can be competitive to, if not better than, a $kL$-layer language model. In fact, our empirical analysis reveals an intriguing phenomenon: looped and non-looped models exhibit scaling behavior that depends on their effective depth, akin to the inference-time scaling of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We further elucidate the connection to CoT reasoning by proving that looped models implicitly generate latent thoughts and can simulate $T$ steps of CoT with $T$ loops. Inspired by these findings, we also present an interesting dichotomy between reasoning and memorization, and design a looping-based regularization that is effective on both fronts.|Nikunj Saunshi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17416)|null|
|**2025-02-24**|**COSMOS: A Hybrid Adaptive Optimizer for Memory-Efficient Training of LLMs**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various domains, yet their optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complex and high-dimensional loss landscapes they inhabit. While adaptive optimizers such as AdamW are widely used, they suffer from critical limitations, including an inability to capture interdependencies between coordinates and high memory consumption. Subsequent research, exemplified by SOAP, attempts to better capture coordinate interdependence but incurs greater memory overhead, limiting scalability for massive LLMs. An alternative approach aims to reduce memory consumption through low-dimensional projection, but this leads to substantial approximation errors, resulting in less effective optimization (e.g., in terms of per-token efficiency). In this paper, we propose COSMOS, a novel hybrid optimizer that leverages the varying importance of eigensubspaces in the gradient matrix to achieve memory efficiency without compromising optimization performance. The design of COSMOS is motivated by our empirical insights and practical considerations. Specifically, COSMOS applies SOAP to the leading eigensubspace, which captures the primary optimization dynamics, and MUON to the remaining eigensubspace, which is less critical but computationally expensive to handle with SOAP. This hybrid strategy significantly reduces memory consumption while maintaining robust optimization performance, making it particularly suitable for massive LLMs. Numerical experiments on various datasets and transformer architectures are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of COSMOS.

|**2025-02-24**|**Linguistic Generalizability of Test-Time Scaling in Mathematical Reasoning**|Scaling pre-training compute has proven effective for achieving mulitlinguality, but does the same hold for test-time scaling? In this work, we introduce MCLM, a multilingual math benchmark featuring competition-level problems in 55 languages. We test three test-time scaling methods-Outcome Reward Modeling (ORM), Process Reward Modeling (ORM), and Budget Forcing (BF)-on both Qwen2.5-1.5B Math and MR1-1.5B, a multilingual LLM we trained for extended reasoning. Our experiments show that using Qwen2.5-1.5B Math with ORM achieves a score of 35.8 on MCLM, while BF on MR1-1.5B attains 35.2. Although "thinking LLMs" have recently garnered significant attention, we find that their performance is comparable to traditional scaling methods like best-of-N once constrained to similar levels of inference FLOPs. Moreover, while BF yields a 20-point improvement on English AIME, it provides only a 1.94-point average gain across other languages-a pattern consistent across the other test-time scaling methods we studied-higlighting that test-time scaling may not generalize as effectively to multilingual tasks.

|**2025-02-24**|**Large Language Models are Powerful EHR Encoders**|Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer rich potential for clinical prediction, yet their inherent complexity and heterogeneity pose significant challenges for traditional machine learning approaches. Domain-specific EHR foundation models trained on large collections of unlabeled EHR data have demonstrated promising improvements in predictive accuracy and generalization; however, their training is constrained by limited access to diverse, high-quality datasets and inconsistencies in coding standards and healthcare practices. In this study, we explore the possibility of using general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) based embedding methods as EHR encoders. By serializing patient records into structured Markdown text, transforming codes into human-readable descriptors, we leverage the extensive generalization capabilities of LLMs pretrained on vast public corpora, thereby bypassing the need for proprietary medical datasets. We systematically evaluate two state-of-the-art LLM-embedding models, GTE-Qwen2-7B-Instruct and LLM2Vec-Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, across 15 diverse clinical prediction tasks from the EHRSHOT benchmark, comparing their performance to an EHRspecific foundation model, CLIMBR-T-Base, and traditional machine learning baselines. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based embeddings frequently match or exceed the performance of specialized models, even in few-shot settings, and that their effectiveness scales with the size of the underlying LLM and the available context window. Overall, our findings demonstrate that repurposing LLMs for EHR encoding offers a scalable and effective approach for clinical prediction, capable of overcoming the limitations of traditional EHR modeling and facilitating more interoperable and generalizable healthcare applications.|Stefan Hegselmann et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17403)|null|
|**2025-02-21**|**Privacy Ripple Effects from Adding or Removing Personal Information in Language Model Training**|Due to the sensitive nature of personally identifiable information (PII), its owners may have the authority to control its inclusion or request its removal from large-language model (LLM) training. Beyond this, PII may be added or removed from training datasets due to evolving dataset curation techniques, because they were newly scraped for retraining, or because they were included in a new downstream fine-tuning stage. We find that the amount and ease of PII memorization is a dynamic property of a model that evolves throughout training pipelines and depends on commonly altered design choices. We characterize three such novel phenomena: (1) similar-appearing PII seen later in training can elicit memorization of earlier-seen sequences in what we call assisted memorization, and this is a significant factor (in our settings, up to 1/3); (2) adding PII can increase memorization of other PII significantly (in our settings, as much as $\approx\!7.5\times$ ); and (3) removing PII can lead to other PII being memorized. Model creators should consider these first- and second-order privacy risks when training models to avoid the risk of new PII regurgitation.|Jaydeep Borkar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15680)|null|
|**2025-02-21**|**FLEKE: Federated Locate-then-Edit Knowledge Editing**|Locate-then-Edit Knowledge Editing (LEKE) is a key technique for updating large language models (LLMs) without full retraining. However, existing methods assume a single-user setting and become inefficient in real-world multi-client scenarios, where decentralized organizations (e.g., hospitals, financial institutions) independently update overlapping knowledge, leading to redundant mediator knowledge vector (MKV) computations and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we introduce Federated Locate-then-Edit Knowledge Editing (FLEKE), a novel task that enables multiple clients to collaboratively perform LEKE while preserving privacy and reducing computational overhead. To achieve this, we propose FedEdit, a two-stage framework that optimizes MKV selection and reuse. In the first stage, clients locally apply LEKE and upload the computed MKVs. In the second stage, rather than relying solely on server-based MKV sharing, FLEKE allows clients retrieve relevant MKVs based on cosine similarity, enabling knowledge re-edit and minimizing redundant computations. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedEdit retains over 96% of the performance of non-federated LEKE while significantly outperforming a FedAvg-based baseline by approximately twofold. Besides, we find that MEMIT performs more consistently than PMET in the FLEKE task with our FedEdit framework.

|**2025-02-21**|**AutoToM: Automated Bayesian Inverse Planning and Model Discovery for Open-ended Theory of Mind**|Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand people's mental variables based on their behavior, is key to developing socially intelligent agents. Current approaches to Theory of Mind reasoning either rely on prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), which are prone to systematic errors, or use rigid, handcrafted Bayesian Theory of Mind (BToM) models, which are more robust but cannot generalize across different domains. In this work, we introduce AutoToM, an automated Bayesian Theory of Mind method for achieving open-ended machine Theory of Mind. AutoToM can operate in any domain, infer any mental variable, and conduct robust Theory of Mind reasoning of any order. Given a Theory of Mind inference problem, AutoToM first proposes an initial BToM model. It then conducts automated Bayesian inverse planning based on the proposed model, leveraging an LLM as the backend. Based on the uncertainty of the inference, it iteratively refines the model, by introducing additional mental variables and/or incorporating more timesteps in the context. Empirical evaluations across multiple Theory of Mind benchmarks demonstrate that AutoToM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a scalable, robust, and interpretable approach to machine Theory of Mind.|Zhining Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15676)|null|

However, an overlooked challenge is AI-polished text, where human-written content undergoes subtle refinements using AI tools. This raises a critical question: should minimally polished text be classified as AI-generated? Misclassification can lead to false plagiarism accusations and misleading claims about AI prevalence in online content. In this study, we systematically evaluate eleven state-of-the-art AI-text detectors using our AI-Polished-Text Evaluation (APT-Eval) dataset, which contains $11.7K$ samples refined at varying AI-involvement levels. Our findings reveal that detectors frequently misclassify even minimally polished text as AI-generated, struggle to differentiate between degrees of AI involvement, and exhibit biases against older and smaller models. These limitations highlight the urgent need for more nuanced detection methodologies.|Shoumik Saha et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15666)|null|
|**2025-02-21**|**Machine-generated text detection prevents language model collapse**|As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their generated outputs are proliferating across the web, risking a future where machine-generated content dilutes human-authored text. Since web data is the primary resource for LLM pretraining, future models will be trained on an unknown portion of synthetic data. This will lead to model collapse, a degenerative process which causes models to reinforce their own errors and experience a drop in model performance. In this study, we investigate the impact of decoding strategy on model collapse, where we analyse the characteristics of the generated data during recursive training, its similarity to human references and the resulting model performance. Using the decoding strategies that lead to the most significant model degradation, we tackle the question: how to avoid model collapse when the origin (human or synthetic) of the training data is unknown. We design a novel methodology based on resampling the data distribution using importance weights from our machine-generated text detector. Our method is validated on two LLM variants (GPT-2 and SmolLM2) on the open-ended text generation task, demonstrating that we can successfully prevent model collapse and when there is enough human-authored data in the training dataset, our method improves model performance.|George Drayson et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15654)|null|
|**2025-02-21**|**Empowering LLMs with Logical Reasoning: A Comprehensive Survey**|Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes on various natural language tasks. However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. This paper summarizes and categorizes the main challenges into two aspects: (1) Logical question answering, LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains. (2) Logical consistency, LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering LLM answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose detailed taxonomies of these methods. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, pretraining, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistency, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extensions to modal logic to account for uncertainty, and efficient algorithms satisfying multiple logical consistencies simultaneously.|Fengxiang Cheng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15652)|null|
|**2025-02-21**|**Steering into New Embedding Spaces: Analyzing Cross-Lingual Alignment Induced by Model Interventions in Multilingual Language Models**|Aligned representations across languages is a desired property in multilingual large language models (mLLMs), as alignment can improve performance in cross-lingual tasks. Typically alignment requires fine-tuning a model, which is computationally expensive, and sizable language data, which often may not be available. A data-efficient alternative to fine-tuning is model interventions -- a method for manipulating model activations to steer generation into the desired direction. We analyze the effect of a popular intervention (finding experts) on the alignment of cross-lingual representations in mLLMs. We identify the neurons to manipulate for a given language and introspect the embedding space of mLLMs pre- and post-manipulation. We show that modifying the mLLM's activations changes its embedding space such that cross-lingual alignment is enhanced. Further, we show that the changes to the embedding space translate into improved downstream performance on retrieval tasks, with up to 2x improvements in top-1 accuracy on cross-lingual retrieval.|Anirudh Sundar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15639)|null|
|**2025-02-21**|**The Relationship Between Reasoning and Performance in Large Language Models -- o3 (mini) Thinks Harder, Not Longer**|Large language models have demonstrated remarkable progress in mathematical reasoning, leveraging chain-of-thought and test-time compute scaling. However, many open questions remain regarding the interplay between reasoning token usage and accuracy gains. In particular, when comparing models across generations, it is unclear whether improved performance results from longer reasoning chains or more efficient reasoning. We systematically analyze chain-of-thought length across o1-mini and o3-mini variants on the Omni-MATH benchmark, finding that o3-mini (m) achieves superior accuracy without requiring longer reasoning chains than o1-mini. Moreover, we show that accuracy generally declines as reasoning chains grow across all models and compute settings, even when controlling for difficulty of the questions. This accuracy drop is significantly smaller in more proficient models, suggesting that new generations of reasoning models use test-time compute more effectively. Finally, we highlight that while o3-mini (h) achieves a marginal accuracy gain over o3-mini (m), it does so by allocating substantially more reasoning tokens across all problems, even the ones that o3-mini (m) can already solve. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between model capability and reasoning length, with implications for efficiency, scaling, and evaluation methodologies.|Marthe Ballon et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15631)|null|
|**2025-02-21**|**Probe Pruning: Accelerating LLMs through Dynamic Pruning via Model-Probing**|We introduce Probe Pruning (PP), a novel framework for online, dynamic, structured pruning of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied in a batch-wise manner. PP leverages the insight that not all samples and tokens contribute equally to the model's output, and probing a small portion of each batch effectively identifies crucial weights, enabling tailored dynamic pruning for different batches. It comprises three main stages: probing, history-informed pruning, and full inference. In the probing stage, PP selects a small yet crucial set of hidden states, based on residual importance, to run a few model layers ahead. During the history-informed pruning stage, PP strategically integrates the probing states with historical states. Subsequently, it structurally prunes weights based on the integrated states and the PP importance score, a metric developed specifically to assess the importance of each weight channel in maintaining performance. In the final stage, full inference is conducted on the remaining weights. A major advantage of PP is its compatibility with existing models, as it operates without requiring additional neural network modules or fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations of PP on LLaMA-2/3 and OPT models reveal that even minimal probing-using just 1.5% of FLOPs-can substantially enhance the efficiency of structured pruning of LLMs. For instance, when evaluated on LLaMA-2-7B with WikiText2, PP achieves a 2.56 times lower ratio of performance degradation per unit of runtime reduction compared to the state-of-the-art method at a 40% pruning ratio.

|**2025-02-21**|**On the Robustness of Transformers against Context Hijacking for Linear Classification**|Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful in-context learning capabilities. However, their predictions can be disrupted by factually correct context, a phenomenon known as context hijacking, revealing a significant robustness issue. To understand this phenomenon theoretically, we explore an in-context linear classification problem based on recent advances in linear transformers. In our setup, context tokens are designed as factually correct query-answer pairs, where the queries are similar to the final query but have opposite labels. Then, we develop a general theoretical analysis on the robustness of the linear transformers, which is formulated as a function of the model depth, training context lengths, and number of hijacking context tokens. A key finding is that a well-trained deeper transformer can achieve higher robustness, which aligns with empirical observations. We show that this improvement arises because deeper layers enable more fine-grained optimization steps, effectively mitigating interference from context hijacking. This is also well supported by our numerical experiments. Our findings provide theoretical insights into the benefits of deeper architectures and contribute to enhancing the understanding of transformer architectures.|Tianle Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15609)|null|
|**2025-02-20**|**LServe: Efficient Long-sequence LLM Serving with Unified Sparse Attention**|Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences, yet efficiently serving these long-context models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy.

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on simple image-text interactions, overlooking complex visual formats like charts that are prevalent in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a novel task, Chart-based MRAG, to address this limitation. To semi-automatically generate high-quality evaluation samples, we propose CHARt-based document question-answering GEneration (CHARGE), a framework that produces evaluation data through structured keypoint extraction, crossmodal verification, and keypoint-based generation. By combining CHARGE with expert validation, we construct Chart-MRAG Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for chart-based MRAG evaluation, featuring 4,738 question-answering pairs across 8 domains from real-world documents. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations in current approaches: (1) unified multimodal embedding retrieval methods struggles in chart-based scenarios, (2) even with ground-truth retrieval, state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve only 58.19% Correctness and 73.87% Coverage scores, and (3) MLLMs demonstrate consistent text-over-visual modality bias during Chart-based MRAG reasoning.

|**2025-02-20**|**Aligning LLMs to Ask Good Questions A Case Study in Clinical Reasoning**|Large language models (LLMs) often fail to ask effective questions under uncertainty, making them unreliable in domains where proactive information-gathering is essential for decisionmaking. We present ALFA, a framework that improves LLM question-asking by (i) decomposing the notion of a "good" question into a set of theory-grounded attributes (e.g., clarity, relevance), (ii) controllably synthesizing attribute-specific question variations, and (iii) aligning models via preference-based optimization to explicitly learn to ask better questions along these fine-grained attributes. Focusing on clinical reasoning as a case study, we introduce the MediQ-AskDocs dataset, composed of 17k real-world clinical interactions augmented with 80k attribute-specific preference pairs of follow-up questions, as well as a novel expert-annotated interactive healthcare QA task to evaluate question-asking abilities. Models aligned with ALFA reduce diagnostic errors by 56.6% on MediQ-AskDocs compared to SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs, with a question-level win-rate of 64.4% and strong generalizability. Our findings suggest that explicitly guiding question-asking with structured, fine-grained attributes offers a scalable path to improve LLMs, especially in expert application domains.|Shuyue Stella Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14860)|null|
|**2025-02-20**|**FR-Spec: Accelerating Large-Vocabulary Language Models via Frequency-Ranked Speculative Sampling**|Speculative sampling has emerged as an important technique for accelerating the auto-regressive generation process of large language models (LLMs) by utilizing a draft-then-verify mechanism to produce multiple tokens per forward pass. While state-of-the-art speculative sampling methods use only a single layer and a language modeling (LM) head as the draft model to achieve impressive layer compression, their efficiency gains are substantially reduced for large-vocabulary LLMs, such as Llama-3-8B with a vocabulary of 128k tokens. To address this, we present FR-Spec, a frequency-ranked speculative sampling framework that optimizes draft candidate selection through vocabulary space compression. By constraining the draft search to a frequency-prioritized token subset, our method reduces LM Head computation overhead by 75% while ensuring the equivalence of the final output distribution. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate an average of 1.12 $\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art speculative sampling method EAGLE-2.|Weilin Zhao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14856)|null|
|**2025-02-20**|**Prompt-to-Leaderboard**|Large language model (LLM) evaluations typically rely on aggregated metrics like accuracy or human preference, averaging across users and prompts. This averaging obscures user- and prompt-specific variations in model performance. To address this, we propose Prompt-to-Leaderboard (P2L), a method that produces leaderboards specific to a prompt. The core idea is to train an LLM taking natural language prompts as input to output a vector of Bradley-Terry coefficients which are then used to predict the human preference vote. The resulting prompt-dependent leaderboards allow for unsupervised task-specific evaluation, optimal routing of queries to models, personalization, and automated evaluation of model strengths and weaknesses. Data from Chatbot Arena suggest that P2L better captures the nuanced landscape of language model performance than the averaged leaderboard. Furthermore, our findings suggest that P2L's ability to produce prompt-specific evaluations follows a power law scaling similar to that observed in LLMs themselves. In January 2025, the router we trained based on this methodology achieved the \#1 spot in the Chatbot Arena leaderboard.

|**2025-02-20**|**CLIPPER: Compression enables long-context synthetic data generation**|LLM developers are increasingly reliant on synthetic data, but generating high-quality data for complex long-context reasoning tasks remains challenging. We introduce CLIPPER, a compression-based approach for generating synthetic data tailored to narrative claim verification - a task that requires reasoning over a book to verify a given claim. Instead of generating claims directly from the raw text of the book, which results in artifact-riddled claims, CLIPPER first compresses the book into chapter outlines and book summaries and then uses these intermediate representations to generate complex claims and corresponding chain-of-thoughts. Compared to naive approaches, CLIPPER produces claims that are more valid, grounded, and complex. Using CLIPPER, we construct a dataset of 19K synthetic book claims paired with their source texts and chain-of-thought reasoning, and use it to fine-tune three open-weight models. Our best model achieves breakthrough results on narrative claim verification (from 28% to 76% accuracy on our test set) and sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-10B models on the NoCha leaderboard. Further analysis shows that our models generate more detailed and grounded chain-of-thought reasoning while also improving performance on other narrative understanding tasks (e.g., NarrativeQA).|Chau Minh Pham et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14854)|null|

To address these challenges, we propose GATE (Graph-based Adaptive Tool Evolution), an adaptive framework that dynamically constructs and evolves a hierarchical graph of reusable tools across multiple scenarios. We evaluate GATE on open-ended tasks (Minecraft), agent-based tasks (TextCraft, DABench), and code generation tasks (MATH, Date, TabMWP). Our results show that GATE achieves up to 4.3x faster milestone completion in Minecraft compared to the previous SOTA, and provides an average improvement of 9.23% over existing tool-making methods in code generation tasks and 10.03% in agent tasks. GATE demonstrates the power of adaptive evolution, balancing tool quantity, complexity, and functionality while maintaining high efficiency.

While the communication framework is crucial for agent coordination, it also introduces a critical yet unexplored security vulnerability. In this work, we introduce Agent-in-the-Middle (AiTM), a novel attack that exploits the fundamental communication mechanisms in LLM-MAS by intercepting and manipulating inter-agent messages. Unlike existing attacks that compromise individual agents, AiTM demonstrates how an adversary can compromise entire multi-agent systems by only manipulating the messages passing between agents. To enable the attack under the challenges of limited control and role-restricted communication format, we develop an LLM-powered adversarial agent with a reflection mechanism that generates contextually-aware malicious instructions. Our comprehensive evaluation across various frameworks, communication structures, and real-world applications demonstrates that LLM-MAS is vulnerable to communication-based attacks, highlighting the need for robust security measures in multi-agent systems.|Pengfei He et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14847)|null|
|**2025-02-20**|**Scaling Text-Rich Image Understanding via Code-Guided Synthetic Multimodal Data Generation**|Reasoning about images with rich text, such as charts and documents, is a critical application of vision-language models (VLMs). However, VLMs often struggle in these domains due to the scarcity of diverse text-rich vision-language data. To address this challenge, we present CoSyn, a framework that leverages the coding capabilities of text-only large language models (LLMs) to automatically create synthetic text-rich multimodal data. Given input text describing a target domain (e.g., "nutrition fact labels"), CoSyn prompts an LLM to generate code (Python, HTML, LaTeX, etc.) for rendering synthetic images. With the underlying code as textual representations of the synthetic images, CoSyn can generate high-quality instruction-tuning data, again relying on a text-only LLM. Using CoSyn, we constructed a dataset comprising 400K images and 2.7M rows of vision-language instruction-tuning data. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art performance among competitive open-source models, including Llama 3.2, and surpass proprietary models such as GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Flash. Furthermore, CoSyn can produce synthetic pointing data, enabling VLMs to ground information within input images, showcasing its potential for developing multimodal agents capable of acting in real-world environments.|Yue Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14846)|null|
|**2025-02-20**|**Revealing and Mitigating Over-Attention in Knowledge Editing**|Large Language Models have demonstrated superior performance across a wide range of tasks, but they still exhibit undesirable errors due to incorrect knowledge learned from the training data. To avoid this, knowledge editing methods emerged to precisely edit the specific model knowledge via efficiently modifying a very small percentage of parameters. % However, those methods can lead to the problem of Specificity Failure: when the content related to the edited knowledge occurs in the context, it can inadvertently corrupt other pre-existing knowledge. However, those methods can lead to the problem of Specificity Failure, where the existing knowledge and capabilities are severely degraded due to editing. Our preliminary indicates that Specificity Failure primarily stems from the model's attention heads assigning excessive attention scores to entities related to the edited knowledge, thereby unduly focusing on specific snippets within the context, which we denote as the Attention Drift phenomenon. To mitigate such Attention Drift issue, we introduce a simple yet effective method Selective Attention Drift Restriction}(SADR), which introduces an additional regularization term during the knowledge editing process to restrict changes in the attention weight distribution, thereby preventing undue focus on the edited entity. Experiments on five frequently used strong LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where SADR can significantly mitigate Specificity Failure in the predominant knowledge editing tasks.|Pinzheng Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14838)|null|
|**2025-02-20**|**Where's the Bug? Attention Probing for Scalable Fault Localization**|Ensuring code correctness remains a challenging problem even as large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable at code-related tasks. While LLM-based program repair systems can propose bug fixes using only a user's bug report, their effectiveness is fundamentally limited by their ability to perform fault localization (FL), a challenging problem for both humans and LLMs. Existing FL approaches rely on executable test cases, require training on costly and often noisy line-level annotations, or demand resource-intensive LLMs. In this paper, we present Bug Attention Probe (BAP), a method which learns state-of-the-art fault localization without any direct localization labels, outperforming traditional FL baselines and prompting of large-scale LLMs. We evaluate our approach across a variety of code settings, including real-world Java bugs from the standard Defects4J dataset as well as seven other datasets which span a diverse set of bug types and languages. Averaged across all eight datasets, BAP improves by 34.6% top-1 accuracy compared to the strongest baseline and 93.4% over zero-shot prompting GPT-4o. BAP is also significantly more efficient than prompting, outperforming large open-weight models at a small fraction of the computational cost.|Adam Stein et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13966)|null|

However, existing LLM serving systems ignore dependencies between programs and calls, missing significant opportunities for optimization. Our analysis reveals that programs submitted to LLM serving engines experience long cumulative wait times, primarily due to head-of-line blocking at both the individual LLM request and the program. To address this, we introduce Autellix, an LLM serving system that treats programs as first-class citizens to minimize their end-to-end latencies. Autellix intercepts LLM calls submitted by programs, enriching schedulers with program-level context. We propose two scheduling algorithms-for single-threaded and distributed programs-that preempt and prioritize LLM calls based on their programs' previously completed calls. Our evaluation demonstrates that across diverse LLMs and agentic workloads, Autellix improves throughput of programs by 4-15x at the same latency compared to state-of-the-art systems, such as vLLM.|Michael Luo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13965)|null|

We propose Multi-Document Attention Focusing (MuDAF), a novel method that explicitly optimizes the attention distribution at the head level through contrastive learning. According to the experimental results, MuDAF can significantly improve the long-context question answering performance of LLMs, especially in multi-document question answering.

|**2025-02-19**|**Is That Your Final Answer? Test-Time Scaling Improves Selective Question Answering**|Scaling the test-time compute of large language models has demonstrated impressive performance on reasoning benchmarks. However, existing evaluations of test-time scaling make the strong assumption that a reasoning system should always give an answer to any question provided. This overlooks concerns about whether a model is confident in its answer, and whether it is appropriate to always provide a response. To address these concerns, we extract confidence scores during reasoning for thresholding model responses. We find that increasing compute budget at inference time not only helps models answer more questions correctly, but also increases confidence in correct responses. We then extend the current paradigm of zero-risk responses during evaluation by considering settings with non-zero levels of response risk, and suggest a recipe for reporting evaluations under these settings.|William Jurayj et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13962)|null|

Recent advances in artificial intelligence for chemistry have sought to expedite individual drug discovery tasks; however, there remains a critical need for an intelligent agent that can navigate the drug discovery process. Towards this end, we introduce LIDDiA, an autonomous agent capable of intelligently navigating the drug discovery process in silico. By leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models, LIDDiA serves as a low-cost and highly-adaptable tool for autonomous drug discovery. We comprehensively examine LIDDiA, demonstrating that (1) it can generate molecules meeting key pharmaceutical criteria on over 70% of 30 clinically relevant targets, (2) it intelligently balances exploration and exploitation in the chemical space, and (3) it can identify promising novel drug candidates on EGFR, a critical target for cancers.|Reza Averly et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13959)|null|

While agentic reasoning and search offer a more adaptive approach, most existing methods depend heavily on prompt engineering. In this work, we introduce RAG-Gym, a unified optimization framework that enhances information-seeking agents through fine-grained process supervision at each search step. We also propose ReSearch, a novel agent architecture that synergizes answer reasoning and search query generation within the RAG-Gym framework. Experiments on four challenging datasets show that RAG-Gym improves performance by up to 25.6\% across various agent architectures, with ReSearch consistently outperforming existing baselines. Further analysis highlights the effectiveness of advanced LLMs as process reward judges and the transferability of trained reward models as verifiers for different LLMs. Additionally, we examine the scaling properties of training and inference in agentic RAG.

|**2025-02-19**|**Why Safeguarded Ships Run Aground? Aligned Large Language Models' Safety Mechanisms Tend to Be Anchored in The Template Region**|The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) remains vulnerable, as their initial behavior can be easily jailbroken by even relatively simple attacks. Since infilling a fixed template between the input instruction and initial model output is a common practice for existing LLMs, we hypothesize that this template is a key factor behind their vulnerabilities: LLMs' safety-related decision-making overly relies on the aggregated information from the template region, which largely influences these models' safety behavior. We refer to this issue as template-anchored safety alignment. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments and verify that template-anchored safety alignment is widespread across various aligned LLMs. Our mechanistic analyses demonstrate how it leads to models' susceptibility when encountering inference-time jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we show that detaching safety mechanisms from the template region is promising in mitigating vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. We encourage future research to develop more robust safety alignment techniques that reduce reliance on the template region.|Chak Tou Leong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13946)|null|

However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on single-image understanding, leaving the analysis of image sequences largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce StripCipher, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate capabilities of LMMs to comprehend and reason over sequential images. StripCipher comprises a human-annotated dataset and three challenging subtasks: visual narrative comprehension, contextual frame prediction, and temporal narrative reordering. Our evaluation of $16$ state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, reveals a significant performance gap compared to human capabilities, particularly in tasks that require reordering shuffled sequential images. For instance, GPT-4o achieves only 23.93% accuracy in the reordering subtask, which is 56.07% lower than human performance. Further quantitative analysis discuss several factors, such as input format of images, affecting the performance of LLMs in sequential understanding, underscoring the fundamental challenges that remain in the development of LMMs.|Xiaochen Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13925)|null|
|**2025-02-19**|**Qwen2.5-VL Technical Report**|We introduce Qwen2.5-VL, the latest flagship model of Qwen vision-language series, which demonstrates significant advancements in both foundational capabilities and innovative functionalities. Qwen2.5-VL achieves a major leap forward in understanding and interacting with the world through enhanced visual recognition, precise object localization, robust document parsing, and long-video comprehension. A standout feature of Qwen2.5-VL is its ability to localize objects using bounding boxes or points accurately. It provides robust structured data extraction from invoices, forms, and tables, as well as detailed analysis of charts, diagrams, and layouts. To handle complex inputs, Qwen2.5-VL introduces dynamic resolution processing and absolute time encoding, enabling it to process images of varying sizes and videos of extended durations (up to hours) with second-level event localization. This allows the model to natively perceive spatial scales and temporal dynamics without relying on traditional normalization techniques. By training a native dynamic-resolution Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch and incorporating Window Attention, we reduce computational overhead while maintaining native resolution. As a result, Qwen2.5-VL excels not only in static image and document understanding but also as an interactive visual agent capable of reasoning, tool usage, and task execution in real-world scenarios such as operating computers and mobile devices. Qwen2.5-VL is available in three sizes, addressing diverse use cases from edge AI to high-performance computing. The flagship Qwen2.5-VL-72B model matches state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, particularly excelling in document and diagram understanding. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL maintains robust linguistic performance, preserving the core language competencies of the Qwen2.5 LLM.|Shuai Bai et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13923)|null|
|**2025-02-18**|**Re-Align: Aligning Vision Language Models via Retrieval-Augmented Direct Preference Optimization**|The emergence of large Vision Language Models (VLMs) has broadened the scope and capabilities of single-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating visual modalities, thereby unlocking transformative cross-modal applications in a variety of real-world scenarios. Despite their impressive performance, VLMs are prone to significant hallucinations, particularly in the form of cross-modal inconsistencies. Building on the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning LLMs, recent advancements have focused on applying direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated datasets to mitigate these issues. Yet, such approaches typically introduce preference signals in a brute-force manner, neglecting the crucial role of visual information in the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Re-Align, a novel alignment framework that leverages image retrieval to construct a dual-preference dataset, effectively incorporating both textual and visual preference signals. We further introduce rDPO, an extension of the standard direct preference optimization that incorporates an additional visual preference objective during fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Re-Align not only mitigates hallucinations more effectively than previous methods but also yields significant performance gains in general visual question-answering (VQA) tasks. Moreover, we show that Re-Align maintains robustness and scalability across a wide range of VLM sizes and architectures. This work represents a significant step forward in aligning multimodal LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and effective cross-modal applications.

We propose mmMamba, a framework for developing linear-complexity native multimodal state space models through progressive distillation from existing MLLMs using moderate academic computational resources. Our approach enables the direct conversion of trained decoder-only MLLMs to linear-complexity architectures without requiring pre-trained RNN-based LLM or vision encoders. We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba from trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can effectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving multimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures that combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable efficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based decoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against existing linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further improves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities. At 103K tokens, mmMamba-linear demonstrates 20.6 $\times$ speedup and 75.8% GPU memory reduction compared to HoVLE, while mmMamba-hybrid achieves 13.5$\times$ speedup and 60.2% memory savings.

In this paper, departing from traditional deep learning attack paradigms, we explore their intrinsic relationship and collectively term them Prompt Trigger Attacks (PTA). This raises a key question: Can we determine if a prompt is benign or poisoned? To address this, we propose UniGuardian, the first unified defense mechanism designed to detect prompt injection, backdoor attacks, and adversarial attacks in LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a single-forward strategy to optimize the detection pipeline, enabling simultaneous attack detection and text generation within a single forward pass.

Yet, behind advancements lies a complex and often tedious process requiring labor and compute intensive iteration and experimentation. Engineers and scientists developing machine learning models spend much of their time on trial-and-error tasks instead of conceptualizing innovative solutions or research hypotheses. To address this challenge, we introduce AI-Driven Exploration (AIDE), a machine learning engineering agent powered by large language models (LLMs). AIDE frames machine learning engineering as a code optimization problem, and formulates trial-and-error as a tree search in the space of potential solutions. By strategically reusing and refining promising solutions, AIDE effectively trades computational resources for enhanced performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple machine learning engineering benchmarks, including our Kaggle evaluations, OpenAI MLE-Bench and METRs RE-Bench.|Zhengyao Jiang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13138)|null|
|**2025-02-18**|**Theorem Prover as a Judge for Synthetic Data Generation**|The demand for synthetic data in mathematical reasoning has increased due to its potential to enhance the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, ensuring the validity of intermediate reasoning steps remains a significant challenge, affecting data quality. While formal verification via theorem provers effectively validates LLM reasoning, the autoformalisation of mathematical proofs remains error-prone. In response, we introduce iterative autoformalisation, an approach that iteratively refines theorem prover formalisation to mitigate errors, thereby increasing the execution rate on the Lean prover from 60% to 87%. Building upon that, we introduce Theorem Prover as a Judge (TP-as-a-Judge), a method that employs theorem prover formalisation to rigorously assess LLM intermediate reasoning, effectively integrating autoformalisation with synthetic data generation. Finally, we present Reinforcement Learning from Theorem Prover Feedback (RLTPF), a framework that replaces human annotation with theorem prover feedback in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Across multiple LLMs, applying TP-as-a-Judge and RLTPF improves benchmarks with only 3,508 samples, achieving 5.56% accuracy gain on Mistral-7B for MultiArith, 6.00% on Llama-2-7B for SVAMP, and 3.55% on Llama-3.1-8B for AQUA.|Joshua Ong Jun Leang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13137)|null|
|**2025-02-18**|**Learning to Defer for Causal Discovery with Imperfect Experts**|Integrating expert knowledge, e.g. from large language models, into causal discovery algorithms can be challenging when the knowledge is not guaranteed to be correct. Expert recommendations may contradict data-driven results, and their reliability can vary significantly depending on the domain or specific query. Existing methods based on soft constraints or inconsistencies in predicted causal relationships fail to account for these variations in expertise. To remedy this, we propose L2D-CD, a method for gauging the correctness of expert recommendations and optimally combining them with data-driven causal discovery results. By adapting learning-to-defer (L2D) algorithms for pairwise causal discovery (CD), we learn a deferral function that selects whether to rely on classical causal discovery methods using numerical data or expert recommendations based on textual meta-data. We evaluate L2D-CD on the canonical T\"ubingen pairs dataset and demonstrate its superior performance compared to both the causal discovery method and the expert used in isolation. Moreover, our approach identifies domains where the expert's performance is strong or weak. Finally, we outline a strategy for generalizing this approach to causal discovery on graphs with more than two variables, paving the way for further research in this area.|Oscar Clivio et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13132)|null|
|**2025-02-18**|**Rethinking Diverse Human Preference Learning through Principal Component Analysis**|Understanding human preferences is crucial for improving foundation models and building personalized AI systems. However, preferences are inherently diverse and complex, making it difficult for traditional reward models to capture their full range. While fine-grained preference data can help, collecting it is expensive and hard to scale. In this paper, we introduce Decomposed Reward Models (DRMs), a novel approach that extracts diverse human preferences from binary comparisons without requiring fine-grained annotations. Our key insight is to represent human preferences as vectors and analyze them using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By constructing a dataset of embedding differences between preferred and rejected responses, DRMs identify orthogonal basis vectors that capture distinct aspects of preference. These decomposed rewards can be flexibly combined to align with different user needs, offering an interpretable and scalable alternative to traditional reward models. We demonstrate that DRMs effectively extract meaningful preference dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, safety, humor) and adapt to new users without additional training. Our results highlight DRMs as a powerful framework for personalized and interpretable LLM alignment.|Feng Luo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13131)|null|
|**2025-02-18**|**Facilitating Long Context Understanding via Supervised Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**|Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled them to process increasingly longer sequences, ranging from 2K to 2M tokens and even beyond. However, simply extending the input sequence length does not necessarily lead to effective long-context understanding. In this study, we integrate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into LLMs in a supervised manner to facilitate effective long-context understanding. To achieve this, we introduce LongFinanceQA, a synthetic dataset in the financial domain designed to improve long-context reasoning. Unlike existing long-context synthetic data, LongFinanceQA includes intermediate CoT reasoning before the final conclusion, which encourages LLMs to perform explicit reasoning, improving accuracy and interpretability in long-context understanding. To generate synthetic CoT reasoning, we propose Property-driven Agentic Inference (PAI), an agentic framework that simulates human-like reasoning steps, including property extraction, retrieval, and summarization. We evaluate PAI's reasoning capabilities by assessing GPT-4o-mini w/ PAI on the Loong benchmark, outperforming standard GPT-4o-mini by 20.0%. Furthermore, we fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on LongFinanceQA, achieving a 24.6% gain on Loong's financial subset.|Jingyang Lin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13127)|null|

To address this gap, we introduce RuozhiBench, a bilingual dataset comprising 677 carefully curated questions that contain various forms of deceptive reasoning, meticulously crafted through extensive human effort and expert review. In a comprehensive evaluation of 17 LLMs from 5 Series over RuozhiBench using both open-ended and two-choice formats, we conduct extensive analyses on evaluation protocols and result patterns. Despite their high scores on conventional benchmarks, these models showed limited ability to detect and reason correctly about logical fallacies, with even the best-performing model, Claude-3-haiku, achieving only 62% accuracy compared to the human of more than 90%.|Zenan Zhai et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13125)|null|

While psycholinguistic studies have examined its effects in relation to human cognition, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs) process gender-inclusive language. Given that commercial LLMs are gaining an increasingly strong foothold in everyday applications, it is crucial to examine whether LLMs in fact interpret gender-inclusive language neutrally, because the language they generate has the potential to influence the language of their users. This study examines whether LLM-generated coreferent terms align with a given gender expression or reflect model biases. Adapting psycholinguistic methods from French to English and German, we find that in English, LLMs generally maintain the antecedent's gender but exhibit underlying masculine bias. In German, this bias is much stronger, overriding all tested gender-neutralization strategies.|Marion Bartl et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13120)|null|
|**2025-02-17**|**Idiosyncrasies in Large Language Models**|In this work, we unveil and study idiosyncrasies in Large Language Models (LLMs) -- unique patterns in their outputs that can be used to distinguish the models. To do so, we consider a simple classification task: given a particular text output, the objective is to predict the source LLM that generates the text. We evaluate this synthetic task across various groups of LLMs and find that simply fine-tuning existing text embedding models on LLM-generated texts yields excellent classification accuracy. Notably, we achieve 97.1% accuracy on held-out validation data in the five-way classification problem involving ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our further investigation reveals that these idiosyncrasies are rooted in word-level distributions. These patterns persist even when the texts are rewritten, translated, or summarized by an external LLM, suggesting that they are also encoded in the semantic content. Additionally, we leverage LLM as judges to generate detailed, open-ended descriptions of each model's idiosyncrasies. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our findings, particularly for training on synthetic data and inferring model similarity.

Our work extends the classic auction scenario by creating a realistic environment where multiple agents bid on houses, weighing aspects such as size, location, and budget to secure the most desirable homes at the lowest prices. Particularly, we investigate three key questions: (a) How does a persona influence an agent's behavior in a competitive setting? (b) Can an agent effectively profile its competitors' behavior during auctions? (c) How can persona profiling be leveraged to create an advantage using strategies such as theory of mind? Through a series of experiments, we analyze the behaviors of LLM agents and shed light on new findings.

For the first time, we uncover a common phenomenon: the understanding capabilities of MLLMs are typically stronger than their generative capabilities, with a significant gap between the two. Building on this insight, we propose HermesFlow, a simple yet general framework designed to seamlessly bridge the gap between understanding and generation in MLLMs. Specifically, we take the homologous data as input to curate homologous preference data of both understanding and generation. Through Pair-DPO and self-play iterative optimization, HermesFlow effectively aligns multimodal understanding and generation using homologous preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over prior methods, particularly in narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation.

Balancing Accuracy and Cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Flexible User Control**|Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to mitigate large language model (LLM) hallucinations by incorporating external knowledge retrieval. However, existing RAG frameworks often apply retrieval indiscriminately,leading to inefficiencies-over-retrieving when unnecessary or failing to retrieve iteratively when required for complex reasoning. Recent adaptive retrieval strategies, though adaptively navigates these retrieval strategies, predict only based on query complexity and lacks user-driven flexibility, making them infeasible for diverse user application needs. In this paper, we introduce a novel user-controllable RAG framework that enables dynamic adjustment of the accuracy-cost trade-off. Our approach leverages two classifiers: one trained to prioritize accuracy and another to prioritize retrieval efficiency. Via an interpretable control parameter $\alpha$ , users can seamlessly navigate between minimal-cost retrieval and high-accuracy retrieval based on their specific requirements. We empirically demonstrate that our approach effectively balances accuracy, retrieval cost, and user controllability, making it a practical and adaptable solution for real-world applications.|Jinyan Su et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12145)|null|
|**2025-02-17**|**Small Models Struggle to Learn from Strong Reasoners**|Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex reasoning tasks, and distilling their reasoning capabilities into smaller models has shown promise. However, we uncover an interesting phenomenon, which we term the Small Model Learnability Gap: small models ( $\leq$ 3B parameters) do not consistently benefit from long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning or distillation from larger models. Instead, they perform better when fine-tuned on shorter, simpler reasoning chains that better align with their intrinsic learning capacity. To address this, we propose Mix Distillation, a simple yet effective strategy that balances reasoning complexity by combining long and short CoT examples or reasoning from both larger and smaller models. Our experiments demonstrate that Mix Distillation significantly improves small model reasoning performance compared to training on either data alone. These findings highlight the limitations of direct strong model distillation and underscore the importance of adapting reasoning complexity for effective reasoning capability transfer.|Yuetai Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12143)|null|
|**2025-02-17**|**SoftCoT: Soft Chain-of-Thought for Efficient Reasoning with LLMs**|Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex reasoning tasks by generating intermediate reasoning steps. However, most existing approaches focus on hard token decoding, which constrains reasoning within the discrete vocabulary space and may not always be optimal. While recent efforts explore continuous-space reasoning, they often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limiting their applicability to state-of-the-art LLMs that already perform well in zero-shot settings with a proper instruction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for continuous-space reasoning that does not require modifying the underlying LLM. Specifically, we employ a lightweight assistant model to generate instance-specific soft thought tokens speculatively as the initial chain of thoughts, which are then mapped into the LLM's representation space via a projection module.

Inspired by the success of dynamical systems approaches in neuroscience, here we propose a novel framework for studying computations in deep learning systems. We focus on the residual stream (RS) in transformer models, conceptualizing it as a dynamical system evolving across layers. We find that activations of individual RS units exhibit strong continuity across layers, despite the RS being a non-privileged basis. Activations in the RS accelerate and grow denser over layers, while individual units trace unstable periodic orbits. In reduced-dimensional spaces, the RS follows a curved trajectory with attractor-like dynamics in the lower layers. These insights bridge dynamical systems theory and mechanistic interpretability, establishing a foundation for a "neuroscience of AI" that combines theoretical rigor with large-scale data analysis to advance our understanding of modern neural networks.|Jesseba Fernando et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12131)|null|
|**2025-02-17**|**Scaling Autonomous Agents via Automatic Reward Modeling And Planning**|Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of text-generation tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with problems requiring multi-step decision-making and environmental feedback, such as online shopping, scientific reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving. Unlike pure text data, collecting large-scale decision-making data is challenging. Moreover, many powerful LLMs are only accessible through APIs, which hinders their fine-tuning for agent tasks due to cost and complexity. To address LLM agents' limitations, we propose a framework that can automatically learn a reward model from the environment without human annotations. This model can be used to evaluate the action trajectories of LLM agents and provide heuristics for task planning. Specifically, our approach involves employing one LLM-based agent to navigate an environment randomly, generating diverse action trajectories. Subsequently, a separate LLM is leveraged to assign a task intent and synthesize a negative response alongside the correct response for each trajectory. These triplets (task intent, positive response, and negative response) are then utilized as training data to optimize a reward model capable of scoring action trajectories. The effectiveness and generalizability of our framework are demonstrated through evaluations conducted on different agent benchmarks. In conclusion, our proposed framework represents a significant advancement in enhancing LLM agents' decision-making capabilities. By automating the learning of reward models, we overcome the challenges of data scarcity and API limitations, potentially revolutionizing the application of LLMs in complex and interactive environments.

|**2025-02-17**|**Minimal Ranks, Maximum Confidence: Parameter-efficient Uncertainty Quantification for LoRA**|Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models by decomposing weight updates into low-rank matrices, significantly reducing storage and computational overhead. While effective, standard LoRA lacks mechanisms for uncertainty quantification, leading to overconfident and poorly calibrated models. Bayesian variants of LoRA address this limitation, but at the cost of a significantly increased number of trainable parameters, partially offsetting the original efficiency gains. Additionally, these models are harder to train and may suffer from unstable convergence.   In this work, we propose a novel parameter-efficient Bayesian LoRA, demonstrating that effective uncertainty quantification can be achieved in very low-dimensional parameter spaces. The proposed method achieves strong performance with improved calibration and generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our empirical findings show that, with the appropriate projection of the weight space: (1) uncertainty can be effectively modeled in a low-dimensional space, and (2) weight covariances exhibit low ranks.|Patryk Marszałek et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12122)|null|

In this work, we investigate which factors most strongly influence loss-to-loss scaling. Our experiments reveal that the pretraining data and tokenizer determine the scaling trend. In contrast, model size, optimization hyperparameters, and even significant architectural differences, such as between transformer-based models like Llama and state-space models like Mamba, have limited impact. Consequently, practitioners should carefully curate suitable pretraining datasets for optimal downstream performance, while architectures and other settings can be freely optimized for training efficiency.|Prasanna Mayilvahanan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12120)|null|
|**2025-02-14**|**MM-RLHF: The Next Step Forward in Multimodal LLM Alignment**|Despite notable advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), most state-of-the-art models have not undergone thorough alignment with human preferences. This gap exists because current alignment research has primarily achieved progress in specific areas (e.g., hallucination reduction), while the broader question of whether aligning models with human preferences can systematically enhance MLLM capability remains largely unexplored. To this end, we introduce MM-RLHF, a dataset containing $\mathbf{120k}$ fine-grained, human-annotated preference comparison pairs. This dataset represents a substantial advancement over existing resources, offering superior size, diversity, annotation granularity, and quality. Leveraging this dataset, we propose several key innovations to improve both the quality of reward models and the efficiency of alignment algorithms. Notably, we introduce a Critique-Based Reward Model, which generates critiques of model outputs before assigning scores, offering enhanced interpretability and more informative feedback compared to traditional scalar reward mechanisms. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Reward Scaling, a method that adjusts the loss weight of each sample according to the reward signal, thereby optimizing the use of high-quality comparison pairs. Our approach is rigorously evaluated across $\mathbf{10}$ distinct dimensions and $\mathbf{27}$ benchmarks, with results demonstrating significant and consistent improvements in model performance. Specifically, fine-tuning LLaVA-ov-7B with MM-RLHF and our alignment algorithm leads to a $\mathbf{19.5}$% increase in conversational abilities and a $\mathbf{60}$ % improvement in safety.

|**2025-02-14**|**Aspect-Oriented Summarization for Psychiatric Short-Term Readmission Prediction**|Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled the automated processing of lengthy documents even without supervised training on a task-specific dataset. Yet, their zero-shot performance in complex tasks as opposed to straightforward information extraction tasks remains suboptimal. One feasible approach for tasks with lengthy, complex input is to first summarize the document and then apply supervised fine-tuning to the summary. However, the summarization process inevitably results in some loss of information. In this study we present a method for processing the summaries of long documents aimed to capture different important aspects of the original document. We hypothesize that LLM summaries generated with different aspect-oriented prompts contain different \textit{information signals}, and we propose methods to measure these differences. We introduce approaches to effectively integrate signals from these different summaries for supervised training of transformer models. We validate our hypotheses on a high-impact task -- 30-day readmission prediction from a psychiatric discharge -- using real-world data from four hospitals, and show that our proposed method increases the prediction performance for the complex task of predicting patient outcome.|WonJin Yoon et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10388)|null|

Using contrastive learning, it aligns all major music modalities--including sheet music, performance signals, and audio recordings--with multilingual text in a shared representation space, enabling retrieval across unaligned modalities with text as a bridge. It features a multilingual text encoder adaptable to unseen languages, exhibiting strong cross-lingual generalization. Leveraging retrieval-augmented generation, we curated M4-RAG, a web-scale dataset consisting of 2.31 million music-text pairs. This dataset is enriched with detailed metadata that represents a wide array of global musical traditions. To advance future research, we release WikiMT-X, a benchmark comprising 1,000 triplets of sheet music, audio, and richly varied text descriptions. Experiments show that CLaMP 3 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple MIR tasks, significantly surpassing previous strong baselines and demonstrating excellent generalization in multimodal and multilingual music contexts.|Shangda Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10362)|null|
|**2025-02-14**|**Enhancing Multilingual LLM Pretraining with Model-Based Data Selection**|Dataset curation has become a basis for strong large language model (LLM) performance. While various rule-based filtering heuristics exist for English and multilingual datasets, model-based filtering techniques have primarily focused on English. To address the disparity stemming from limited research on non-English languages, we propose a model-based filtering framework for multilingual datasets that aims to identify a diverse set of structured and knowledge-rich samples. Our approach emphasizes transparency, simplicity, and efficiency, leveraging Transformer- and FastText-based classifiers to ensure the broad accessibility of our technique and data. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the FineWeb-2 web crawl dataset across diverse language families, scripts, and resource availability to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Training a 1B-parameter Llama model for 70B and 119B tokens, our approach can match the baseline MMLU score with as little as 15% of the training tokens, while also improving across other benchmarks. These findings provide strong evidence for the generalizability of our approach to other languages. As a result, we extend our framework to 20 languages for which we release the refined pretraining datasets.|Bettina Messmer et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10361)|null|
|**2025-02-14**|**Agentic Verification for Ambiguous Query Disambiguation**|In this work, we tackle the challenge of disambiguating queries in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to diverse yet answerable interpretations. State-of-the-arts follow a Diversify-then-Verify (DtV) pipeline, where diverse interpretations are generated by an LLM, later used as search queries to retrieve supporting passages. Such a process may introduce noise in either interpretations or retrieval, particularly in enterprise settings, where LLMs -- trained on static data -- may struggle with domain-specific disambiguations. Thus, a post-hoc verification phase is introduced to prune noises. Our distinction is to unify diversification with verification by incorporating feedback from retriever and generator early on. This joint approach improves both efficiency and robustness by reducing reliance on multiple retrieval and inference steps, which are susceptible to cascading errors. We validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, Verified-Diversification with Consolidation (VERDICT), on the widely adopted ASQA benchmark to achieve diverse yet verifiable interpretations. Empirical results show that VERDICT improves grounding-aware F1 score by an average of 23% over the strongest baseline across different backbone LLMs.|Youngwon Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10352)|null|
|**2025-02-14**|**Organize the Web: Constructing Domains Enhances Pre-Training Data Curation**|Modern language models are trained on large, unstructured datasets consisting of trillions of tokens and obtained by crawling the web. The unstructured nature makes it difficult to reason about their contents and develop systematic approaches to data curation. In this paper, we unpack monolithic web corpora by developing taxonomies of their contents and organizing them into domains. We introduce WebOrganizer, a framework for organizing web pages in terms of both their topic and format. Using these two complementary notions of domains, we automatically annotate pre-training data by distilling annotations from a large language model into efficient classifiers. This allows us to study how data from different domains should be mixed to improve models on downstream tasks, and we show that we can combine insights about effective topics and formats to further boost performance. We demonstrate that our domain mixing also improves existing methods that select data based on quality. Furthermore, we study and compare how quality-based methods will implicitly change the domain mixture. Overall, our work demonstrates that constructing and mixing domains provides a valuable complement to quality-based data curation methods, opening new avenues for effective and insightful pre-training data curation.|Alexander Wettig et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10341)|null|
|**2025-02-14**|**Evaluating the Meta- and Object-Level Reasoning of Large Language Models for Question Answering**|Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but still face challenges in Question Answering (QA) tasks requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. We outline the types of reasoning required in some of these tasks, and reframe them in terms of meta-level reasoning (akin to high-level strategic reasoning or planning) and object-level reasoning (embodied in lower-level tasks such as mathematical reasoning). Franklin, a novel dataset with requirements of meta- and object-level reasoning, is introduced and used along with three other datasets to evaluate four LLMs at question answering tasks requiring multiple steps of reasoning. Results from human annotation studies suggest LLMs demonstrate meta-level reasoning with high frequency, but struggle with object-level reasoning tasks in some of the datasets used. Additionally, evidence suggests that LLMs find the object-level reasoning required for the questions in the Franklin dataset challenging, yet they do exhibit strong performance with respect to the meta-level reasoning requirements.|Nick Ferguson et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10338)|null|
|**2025-02-14**|**Process Reward Models for LLM Agents: Practical Framework and Directions**|We introduce Agent Process Reward Models (AgentPRM), a simple and scalable framework for training LLM agents to continually improve through interactions. AgentPRM follows a lightweight actor-critic paradigm, using Monte Carlo rollouts to compute reward targets and optimize policies. It requires minimal modifications to existing RLHF pipelines, making it easy to integrate at scale. Beyond AgentPRM, we propose InversePRM, which learns process rewards directly from demonstrations without explicit outcome supervision. We also explore key challenges and opportunities, including exploration, process reward shaping, and model-predictive reasoning. We evaluate on ALFWorld benchmark, show that small 3B models trained with AgentPRM and InversePRM outperform strong GPT-4o baselines, and analyze test-time scaling, reward hacking, and more.

|**2025-02-14**|**LLM-Powered Preference Elicitation in Combinatorial Assignment**|We study the potential of large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans to simplify preference elicitation (PE) in combinatorial assignment. While traditional PE methods rely on iterative queries to capture preferences, LLMs offer a one-shot alternative with reduced human effort. We propose a framework for LLM proxies that can work in tandem with SOTA ML-powered preference elicitation schemes. Our framework handles the novel challenges introduced by LLMs, such as response variability and increased computational costs. We experimentally evaluate the efficiency of LLM proxies against human queries in the well-studied course allocation domain, and we investigate the model capabilities required for success. We find that our approach improves allocative efficiency by up to 20%, and these results are robust across different LLMs and to differences in quality and accuracy of reporting.|Ermis Soumalias et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10308)|null|

SCALENE, a high-performance CPU, GPU, and memory profiler, provides fine-grained insights into Python applications while running significantly faster than traditional profilers. Originally, SCALENE integrated OpenAI's API to generate AI-powered optimization suggestions, but its reliance on a proprietary API limited accessibility. This study explores the feasibility of using opensource large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 and Llama 3.2, to generate optimization recommendations within SCALENE. Our evaluation reveals that DeepSeek-R1 provides effective code optimizations comparable to proprietary models. We integrate DeepSeek-R1 into SCALENE to automatically analyze performance bottlenecks and suggest improvements, enhancing SCALENE's utility while maintaining its open-source nature. This study demonstrates that open-source LLMs can be viable alternatives for AI-driven code optimization, paving the way for more accessible and cost-effective performance analysis tools.|Saem Hasan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10299)|null|

In this paper, we introduce MME-CoT, a specialized benchmark evaluating the CoT reasoning performance of LMMs, spanning six domains: math, science, OCR, logic, space-time, and general scenes. As the first comprehensive study in this area, we propose a thorough evaluation suite incorporating three novel metrics that assess the reasoning quality, robustness, and efficiency at a fine-grained level. Leveraging curated high-quality data and a unique evaluation strategy, we conduct an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art LMMs, uncovering several key insights: 1) Models with reflection mechanism demonstrate a superior CoT quality, with Kimi k1.5 outperforming GPT-4o and demonstrating the highest quality results; 2) CoT prompting often degrades LMM performance on perception-heavy tasks, suggesting a potentially harmful overthinking behavior; and 3) Although the CoT quality is high, LMMs with reflection exhibit significant inefficiency in both normal response and self-correction phases. We hope MME-CoT serves as a foundation for advancing multimodal reasoning in LMMs. Project Page: https://mmecot.github.io/|Dongzhi Jiang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09621)|null|
|**2025-02-13**|**Exploring the Potential of Encoder-free Architectures in 3D LMMs**|Encoder-free architectures have been preliminarily explored in the 2D visual domain, yet it remains an open question whether they can be effectively applied to 3D understanding scenarios. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the potential of encoder-free architectures to overcome the challenges of encoder-based 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). These challenges include the failure to adapt to varying point cloud resolutions and the point features from the encoder not meeting the semantic needs of Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify key aspects for 3D LMMs to remove the encoder and enable the LLM to assume the role of the 3D encoder: 1) We propose the LLM-embedded Semantic Encoding strategy in the pre-training stage, exploring the effects of various point cloud self-supervised losses. And we present the Hybrid Semantic Loss to extract high-level semantics. 2) We introduce the Hierarchical Geometry Aggregation strategy in the instruction tuning stage. This incorporates inductive bias into the LLM early layers to focus on the local details of the point clouds. To the end, we present the first Encoder-free 3D LMM, ENEL. Our 7B model rivals the current state-of-the-art model, ShapeLLM-13B, achieving 55.0%, 50.92%, and 42.7% on the classification, captioning, and VQA tasks, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the encoder-free architecture is highly promising for replacing encoder-based architectures in the field of 3D understanding.

|**2025-02-13**|**Human-LLM Coevolution: Evidence from Academic Writing**|With a statistical analysis of arXiv paper abstracts, we report a marked drop in the frequency of several words previously identified as overused by ChatGPT, such as "delve", starting soon after they were pointed out in early 2024. The frequency of certain other words favored by ChatGPT, such as "significant", has instead kept increasing. These phenomena suggest that some authors of academic papers have adapted their use of large language models (LLMs), for example, by selecting outputs or applying modifications to the LLM-generated content. Such coevolution and cooperation of humans and LLMs thus introduce additional challenges to the detection of machine-generated text in real-world scenarios. Estimating the impact of LLMs on academic writing by examining word frequency remains feasible, and more attention should be paid to words that were already frequently employed, including those that have decreased in frequency.|Mingmeng Geng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09606)|null|
|**2025-02-13**|**SelfCite: Self-Supervised Alignment for Context Attribution in Large Language Models**|We introduce SelfCite, a novel self-supervised approach that aligns LLMs to generate high-quality, fine-grained, sentence-level citations for the statements in their generated responses. Instead of only relying on costly and labor-intensive annotations, SelfCite leverages a reward signal provided by the LLM itself through context ablation: If a citation is necessary, removing the cited text from the context should prevent the same response; if sufficient, retaining the cited text alone should preserve the same response. This reward can guide the inference-time best-of-N sampling strategy to improve citation quality significantly, as well as be used in preference optimization to directly fine-tune the models for generating better citations. The effectiveness of SelfCite is demonstrated by increasing citation F1 up to 5.3 points on the LongBench-Cite benchmark across five long-form question answering tasks.|Yung-Sung Chuang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09604)|null|
|**2025-02-13**|**Do LLMs Recognize Your Preferences? Evaluating Personalized Preference Following in LLMs**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as chatbots, yet their ability to personalize responses to user preferences remains limited. We introduce PrefEval, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to infer, memorize and adhere to user preferences in a long-context conversational setting. PrefEval comprises 3,000 manually curated user preference and query pairs spanning 20 topics. PrefEval contains user personalization or preference information in both explicit and implicit forms, and evaluates LLM performance using a generation and a classification task. With PrefEval, we evaluated the aforementioned preference following capabilities of 10 open-source and proprietary LLMs in multi-session conversations with varying context lengths up to 100k tokens. We benchmark with various prompting, iterative feedback, and retrieval-augmented generation methods. Our benchmarking effort reveals that state-of-the-art LLMs face significant challenges in proactively following users' preferences during conversations. In particular, in zero-shot settings, preference following accuracy falls below 10% at merely 10 turns (~3k tokens) across most evaluated models. Even with advanced prompting and retrieval methods, preference following still deteriorates in long-context conversations. Furthermore, we show that fine-tuning on PrefEval significantly improves performance. We believe PrefEval serves as a valuable resource for measuring, understanding, and enhancing LLMs' preference following abilities, paving the way for personalized conversational agents.

|**2025-02-13**|**KIMAs: A Configurable Knowledge Integrated Multi-Agent System**|Knowledge-intensive conversations supported by large language models (LLMs) have become one of the most popular and helpful applications that can assist people in different aspects. Many current knowledge-intensive applications are centered on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. While many open-source RAG frameworks facilitate the development of RAG-based applications, they often fall short in handling practical scenarios complicated by heterogeneous data in topics and formats, conversational context management, and the requirement of low-latency response times. This technical report presents a configurable knowledge integrated multi-agent system, KIMAs, to address these challenges. KIMAs features a flexible and configurable system for integrating diverse knowledge sources with 1) context management and query rewrite mechanisms to improve retrieval accuracy and multi-turn conversational coherency, 2) efficient knowledge routing and retrieval, 3) simple but effective filter and reference generation mechanisms, and 4) optimized parallelizable multi-agent pipeline execution. Our work provides a scalable framework for advancing the deployment of LLMs in real-world settings. To show how KIMAs can help developers build knowledge-intensive applications with different scales and emphases, we demonstrate how we configure the system to three applications already running in practice with reliable performance.|Zitao Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09596)|null|

This work conducts a systematic investigation of LLMs' ability to perform logical reasoning in natural language. We introduce a controlled dataset of hypothetical and disjunctive syllogisms in propositional and modal logic and use it as the testbed for understanding LLM performance. Our results lead to novel insights in predicting LLM behaviors: in addition to the probability of input (Gonen et al., 2023; McCoy et al., 2024), logical forms should be considered as orthogonal factors. In addition, we show similarities and differences between the logical reasoning performances of humans and LLMs by comparing LLM and human behavioral results.|Yixuan Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09589)|null|

It consists of a combination of informal, iterative, and semi-structured strategies such as visual diagramming, which poses a challenge for collaborating with large language models (LLMs) in a turn-taking conversational manner. We present Polymind, a visual diagramming tool that leverages multiple LLM-powered agents to support prewriting. The system features a parallel collaboration workflow in place of the turn-taking conversational interactions. It defines multiple ``microtasks'' to simulate group collaboration scenarios such as collaborative writing and group brainstorming. Instead of repetitively prompting a chatbot for various purposes, Polymind enables users to orchestrate multiple microtasks simultaneously. Users can configure and delegate customised microtasks, and manage their microtasks by specifying task requirements and toggling visibility and initiative. Our evaluation revealed that, compared to ChatGPT, users had more customizability over collaboration with Polymind, and were thus able to quickly expand personalised writing ideas during prewriting.|Qian Wan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09577)|null|

Synthetic data offers a potential solution to challenges associated with accessing and using real-world data (RWD). This study aims to evaluate the capability of zero-shot generation of synthetic neurosurgical data with a large language model (LLM), GPT-4o, by benchmarking with the conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN). Synthetic datasets were compared to real-world neurosurgical data to assess fidelity (means, proportions, distributions, and bivariate correlations), utility (ML classifier performance on RWD), and privacy (duplication of records from RWD). The GPT-4o-generated datasets matched or exceeded CTGAN performance, despite no fine-tuning or access to RWD for pre-training. Datasets demonstrated high univariate and bivariate fidelity to RWD without directly exposing any real patient records, even at amplified sample size. Training an ML classifier on GPT-4o-generated data and testing on RWD for a binary prediction task showed an F1 score (0.706) with comparable performance to training on the CTGAN data (0.705) for predicting postoperative functional status deterioration. GPT-4o demonstrated a promising ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic neurosurgical data. These findings also indicate that data synthesized with GPT-4o can effectively augment clinical data with small sample sizes, and train ML models for prediction of neurosurgical outcomes. Further investigation is necessary to improve the preservation of distributional characteristics and boost classifier performance.|Austin A. Barr et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09566)|null|

Recent advances in large language models (LLM) have demonstrated success in automating complex scientific tasks using LLM-based agents. In this paper, we introduce MDCrow, an agentic LLM assistant capable of automating MD workflows. MDCrow uses chain-of-thought over 40 expert-designed tools for handling and processing files, setting up simulations, analyzing the simulation outputs, and retrieving relevant information from literature and databases. We assess MDCrow's performance across 25 tasks of varying required subtasks and difficulty, and we evaluate the agent's robustness to both difficulty and prompt style. \texttt{gpt-4o} is able to complete complex tasks with low variance, followed closely by \texttt{llama3-405b}, a compelling open-source model.

|**2025-02-12**|**Utility Engineering: Analyzing and Controlling Emergent Value Systems in AIs**|As AIs rapidly advance and become more agentic, the risk they pose is governed not only by their capabilities but increasingly by their propensities, including goals and values. Tracking the emergence of goals and values has proven a longstanding problem, and despite much interest over the years it remains unclear whether current AIs have meaningful values. We propose a solution to this problem, leveraging the framework of utility functions to study the internal coherence of AI preferences. Surprisingly, we find that independently-sampled preferences in current LLMs exhibit high degrees of structural coherence, and moreover that this emerges with scale. These findings suggest that value systems emerge in LLMs in a meaningful sense, a finding with broad implications. To study these emergent value systems, we propose utility engineering as a research agenda, comprising both the analysis and control of AI utilities. We uncover problematic and often shocking values in LLM assistants despite existing control measures. These include cases where AIs value themselves over humans and are anti-aligned with specific individuals. To constrain these emergent value systems, we propose methods of utility control. As a case study, we show how aligning utilities with a citizen assembly reduces political biases and generalizes to new scenarios. Whether we like it or not, value systems have already emerged in AIs, and much work remains to fully understand and control these emergent representations.|Mantas Mazeika et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08640)|null|

To allow for domain-specific evaluation, we introduce Cross Lingual Semantic Discrimination (CLSD), a novel cross-lingual semantic search task that requires only a set of parallel sentence pairs of the language pair of interest within the target domain. This task focuses on the ability of a model to cross-lingually rank the true parallel sentence higher than hard negatives generated by a large language model. We create four instances of our introduced CLSD task for the language pair German-French within the domain of news. Within this case study, we find that models that are also fine-tuned for retrieval tasks (e.g., multilingual E5) benefit from using English as the pivot language, while bitext mining models such as LaBSE perform best directly cross-lingually. We also show a fine-grained similarity analysis enabled by our distractor generation strategy, indicating that different embedding models are sensitive to different types of perturbations.|Andrianos Michail et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08638)|null|

The hypothesis presented here is that under a greedy sampling strategy the variance in the LLM's output is a function of the conceptual certainty embedded in the model's parametric knowledge, as well as the lexical variance in the input. Finetuning the model results in reducing the sensitivity of the model output to the lexical input variations. This is then applied to a classification problem and a probabilistic method is proposed for estimating the certainties of the predicted classes.|Srijith Rajamohan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08631)|null|
|**2025-02-12**|**SPeCtrum: A Grounded Framework for Multidimensional Identity Representation in LLM-Based Agent**|Existing methods for simulating individual identities often oversimplify human complexity, which may lead to incomplete or flattened representations. To address this, we introduce SPeCtrum, a grounded framework for constructing authentic LLM agent personas by incorporating an individual's multidimensional self-concept. SPeCtrum integrates three core components: Social Identity (S), Personal Identity (P), and Personal Life Context (C), each contributing distinct yet interconnected aspects of identity. To evaluate SPeCtrum's effectiveness in identity representation, we conducted automated and human evaluations. Automated evaluations using popular drama characters showed that Personal Life Context (C)-derived from short essays on preferences and daily routines-modeled characters' identities more effectively than Social Identity (S) and Personal Identity (P) alone and performed comparably to the full SPC combination. In contrast, human evaluations involving real-world individuals found that the full SPC combination provided a more comprehensive self-concept representation than C alone. Our findings suggest that while C alone may suffice for basic identity simulation, integrating S, P, and C enhances the authenticity and accuracy of real-world identity representation. Overall, SPeCtrum offers a structured approach for simulating individuals in LLM agents, enabling more personalized human-AI interactions and improving the realism of simulation-based behavioral studies.|Keyeun Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08599)|null|

These attacks may extract private information or coerce the model into producing harmful outputs. In real-world deployments, LLMs are often part of a larger agentic pipeline including memory systems, retrieval, web access, and API calling. Such additional components introduce vulnerabilities that make these LLM-powered agents much easier to attack than isolated LLMs, yet relatively little work focuses on the security of LLM agents. In this paper, we analyze security and privacy vulnerabilities that are unique to LLM agents. We first provide a taxonomy of attacks categorized by threat actors, objectives, entry points, attacker observability, attack strategies, and inherent vulnerabilities of agent pipelines. We then conduct a series of illustrative attacks on popular open-source and commercial agents, demonstrating the immediate practical implications of their vulnerabilities. Notably, our attacks are trivial to implement and require no understanding of machine learning.|Ang Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08586)|null|

Although recent Large Language Model (LLM) based methods generate pseudo-relevant content and expanded terms via multiple prompts, they often yield repetitive, narrow expansions that lack the diverse context needed to retrieve all relevant information. In this paper, we introduce QA-Expand, a novel and effective framework for query expansion. It first generates multiple relevant questions from the initial query and subsequently produces corresponding pseudo-answers as surrogate documents. A feedback model further rewrites and filters these answers to ensure only the most informative augmentations are incorporated. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as BEIR and TREC demonstrate that QA-Expand enhances retrieval performance by up to 13% over state-of-the-art methods, offering a robust solution for modern retrieval challenges.|Wonduk Seo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08557)|null|

Mitigating such overreliance is a key challenge. Through a think-aloud study in which participants use an LLM-infused application to answer objective questions, we identify several features of LLM responses that shape users' reliance: explanations (supporting details for answers), inconsistencies in explanations, and sources. Through a large-scale, pre-registered, controlled experiment (N=308), we isolate and study the effects of these features on users' reliance, accuracy, and other measures. We find that the presence of explanations increases reliance on both correct and incorrect responses. However, we observe less reliance on incorrect responses when sources are provided or when explanations exhibit inconsistencies.

|**2025-02-12**|**LLMs can implicitly learn from mistakes in-context**|Learning from mistakes is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. Previous work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can also learn from incorrect answers when provided with a comprehensive rationale detailing why an answer is wrong or how to correct it. In this work, we examine whether LLMs can learn from mistakes in mathematical reasoning tasks when these explanations are not provided. We investigate if LLMs are able to implicitly infer such rationales simply from observing both incorrect and correct answers. Surprisingly, we find that LLMs perform better, on average, when rationales are eliminated from the context and incorrect answers are simply shown alongside correct ones. This approach also substantially outperforms chain-of-thought prompting in our evaluations. We show that these results are consistent across LLMs of different sizes and varying reasoning abilities. Further, we carry out an in-depth analysis, and show that prompting with both wrong and correct answers leads to greater performance and better generalisation than introducing additional, more diverse question-answer pairs into the context. Finally, we show that new rationales generated by models that have only observed incorrect and correct answers are scored equally as highly by humans as those produced with the aid of exemplar rationales. Our results demonstrate that LLMs are indeed capable of in-context implicit learning.|Lisa Alazraki et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08550)|null|
|**2025-02-12**|**LLM Pretraining with Continuous Concepts**|Next token prediction has been the standard training objective used in large language model pretraining. Representations are learned as a result of optimizing for token-level perplexity. We propose Continuous Concept Mixing (CoCoMix), a novel pretraining framework that combines discrete next token prediction with continuous concepts. Specifically, CoCoMix predicts continuous concepts learned from a pretrained sparse autoencoder and mixes them into the model's hidden state by interleaving with token hidden representations. Through experiments on multiple benchmarks, including language modeling and downstream reasoning tasks, we show that CoCoMix is more sample efficient and consistently outperforms standard next token prediction, knowledge distillation and inserting pause tokens. We find that combining both concept learning and interleaving in an end-to-end framework is critical to performance gains. Furthermore, CoCoMix enhances interpretability and steerability by allowing direct inspection and modification of the predicted concept, offering a transparent way to guide the model's internal reasoning process.|Jihoon Tack et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08524)|null|
|**2025-02-11**|**DarwinLM: Evolutionary Structured Pruning of Large Language Models**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various NLP tasks. However, their massive computational costs limit their widespread use, particularly in real-time applications. Structured pruning offers an effective solution by compressing models and directly providing end-to-end speed improvements, regardless of the hardware environment. Meanwhile, different components of the model exhibit varying sensitivities towards pruning, calling for \emph{non-uniform} model compression. However, a pruning method should not only identify a capable substructure, but also account for post-compression training. To this end, we propose \sysname, a method for \emph{training-aware} structured pruning. \sysname builds upon an evolutionary search process, generating multiple offspring models in each generation through mutation, and selecting the fittest for survival. To assess the effect of post-training, we incorporate a lightweight, multistep training process within the offspring population, progressively increasing the number of tokens and eliminating poorly performing models in each selection stage. We validate our method through extensive experiments on Llama-2-7B, Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct, achieving state-of-the-art performance for structured pruning. For instance, \sysname surpasses ShearedLlama while requiring $5\times$ less training data during post-compression training.|Shengkun Tang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07780)|null|
|**2025-02-11**|**Auditing Prompt Caching in Language Model APIs**|Prompt caching in large language models (LLMs) results in data-dependent timing variations: cached prompts are processed faster than non-cached prompts. These timing differences introduce the risk of side-channel timing attacks. For example, if the cache is shared across users, an attacker could identify cached prompts from fast API response times to learn information about other users' prompts. Because prompt caching may cause privacy leakage, transparency around the caching policies of API providers is important. To this end, we develop and conduct statistical audits to detect prompt caching in real-world LLM API providers. We detect global cache sharing across users in seven API providers, including OpenAI, resulting in potential privacy leakage about users' prompts. Timing variations due to prompt caching can also result in leakage of information about model architecture. Namely, we find evidence that OpenAI's embedding model is a decoder-only Transformer, which was previously not publicly known.|Chenchen Gu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07776)|null|
|**2025-02-11**|**Automatic Robot Task Planning by Integrating Large Language Model with Genetic Programming**|Accurate task planning is critical for controlling autonomous systems, such as robots, drones, and self-driving vehicles. Behavior Trees (BTs) are considered one of the most prominent control-policy-defining frameworks in task planning, due to their modularity, flexibility, and reusability. Generating reliable and accurate BT-based control policies for robotic systems remains challenging and often requires domain expertise. In this paper, we present the LLM-GP-BT technique that leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) and Genetic Programming (GP) to automate the generation and configuration of BTs. The LLM-GP-BT technique processes robot task commands expressed in human natural language and converts them into accurate and reliable BT-based task plans in a computationally efficient and user-friendly manner. The proposed technique is systematically developed and validated through simulation experiments, demonstrating its potential to streamline task planning for autonomous systems.|Azizjon Kobilov et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07772)|null|
|**2025-02-11**|**Breaking Down Bias: On The Limits of Generalizable Pruning Strategies**|We employ model pruning to examine how LLMs conceptualize racial biases, and whether a generalizable mitigation strategy for such biases appears feasible. Our analysis yields several novel insights. We find that pruning can be an effective method to reduce bias without significantly increasing anomalous model behavior. Neuron-based pruning strategies generally yield better results than approaches pruning entire attention heads. However, our results also show that the effectiveness of either approach quickly deteriorates as pruning strategies become more generalized. For instance, a model that is trained on removing racial biases in the context of financial decision-making poorly generalizes to biases in commercial transactions. Overall, our analysis suggests that racial biases are only partially represented as a general concept within language models. The other part of these biases is highly context-specific, suggesting that generalizable mitigation strategies may be of limited effectiveness. Our findings have important implications for legal frameworks surrounding AI. In particular, they suggest that an effective mitigation strategy should include the allocation of legal responsibility on those that deploy models in a specific use case.|Sibo Ma et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07771)|null|

Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have emerged as potential resources for answering questions and providing guidance, with many developers now turning to ChatGPT over traditional Q&A sites like Stack Overflow. Nonetheless, LLMs may carry biases in presenting information, which can be especially impactful for newcomers whose problem-solving styles may not be broadly represented. This raises important questions about the accessibility of AI-driven support for newcomers to OSS projects. This vision paper outlines the potential of adapting AI responses to various problem-solving styles to avoid privileging a particular subgroup.

|**2025-02-11**|**Scalable Fingerprinting of Large Language Models**|Model fingerprinting has emerged as a powerful tool for model owners to identify their shared model given API access. However, to lower false discovery rate, fight fingerprint leakage, and defend against coalitions of model users attempting to bypass detection, we argue that {\em scalability} is critical, i.e., scaling up the number of fingerprints one can embed into a model. Hence, we pose scalability as a crucial requirement for fingerprinting schemes. We experiment with fingerprint design at a scale significantly larger than previously considered, and introduce a new method, dubbed Perinucleus sampling, to generate scalable, persistent, and harmless fingerprints. We demonstrate that this scheme can add 24,576 fingerprints to a Llama-3.1-8B model -- two orders of magnitude more than existing schemes -- without degrading the model's utility. Our inserted fingerprints persist even after supervised fine-tuning on standard post-training data. We further address security risks for fingerprinting, and theoretically and empirically show how a scalable fingerprinting scheme like ours can mitigate these risks.|Anshul Nasery et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07760)|null|
|**2025-02-11**|**Towards Efficient Optimizer Design for LLM via Structured Fisher Approximation with a Low-Rank Extension**|Designing efficient optimizers for large language models (LLMs) with low-memory requirements and fast convergence is an important and challenging problem. This paper makes a step towards the systematic design of such optimizers through the lens of structured Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We show that many state-of-the-art efficient optimizers can be viewed as solutions to FIM approximation (under the Frobenius norm) with specific structural assumptions. Building on these insights, we propose two design recommendations of practical efficient optimizers for LLMs, involving the careful selection of structural assumptions to balance generality and efficiency, and enhancing memory efficiency of optimizers with general structures through a novel low-rank extension framework. We demonstrate how to use each design approach by deriving new memory-efficient optimizers: Row and Column Scaled SGD (RACS) and Adaptive low-dimensional subspace estimation (Alice). Experiments on LLaMA pre-training (up to 1B parameters) validate the effectiveness, showing faster and better convergence than existing memory-efficient baselines and Adam with little memory overhead. Notably, Alice achieves better than 2x faster convergence over Adam, while RACS delivers strong performance on the 1B model with SGD-like memory.|Wenbo Gong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07752)|null|

Constructed from open domain mystery novels and short stories, the dataset challenges LLMs to identify the perpetrator after reading and comprehending the story. To evaluate model robustness, we apply a range of character-level name augmentations, including original names, name swaps, and substitutions with well-known real and/or fictional entities from popular discourse. We further use various prompting styles to investigate the influence of prompting on deductive reasoning accuracy.   We conduct evaluation study with state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-4o-mini, evaluated through multiple trials with majority response selection to ensure reliability. The results demonstrate that while LLMs perform reliably on unaltered texts, accuracy diminishes with certain name substitutions, particularly those with wide recognition.

|**2025-02-11**|**The Economics of Large Language Models: Token Allocation, Fine-Tuning, and Optimal Pricing**|We develop an economic framework to analyze the optimal pricing and product design of Large Language Models (LLM). Our framework captures several key features of LLMs: variable operational costs of processing input and output tokens; the ability to customize models through fine-tuning; and high-dimensional user heterogeneity in terms of task requirements and error sensitivity. In our model, a monopolistic seller offers multiple versions of LLMs through a menu of products. The optimal pricing structure depends on whether token allocation across tasks is contractible and whether users face scale constraints. Users with similar aggregate value-scale characteristics choose similar levels of fine-tuning and token consumption. The optimal mechanism can be implemented through menus of two-part tariffs, with higher markups for more intensive users. Our results rationalize observed industry practices such as tiered pricing based on model customization and usage levels.|Dirk Bergemann et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07736)|null|

However, the widespread use of large language models now threatens the quality and integrity of human-generated data on these very platforms. We argue that this issue goes beyond the immediate challenge of filtering AI-generated content--it reveals deeper flaws in how data collection systems are designed. Existing systems often prioritize speed, scale, and efficiency at the cost of intrinsic human motivation, leading to declining engagement and data quality. We propose that rethinking data collection systems to align with contributors' intrinsic motivations--rather than relying solely on external incentives--can help sustain high-quality data sourcing at scale while maintaining contributor trust and long-term participation.|Sebastin Santy et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07732)|null|
|**2025-02-10**|**Visual Agentic AI for Spatial Reasoning with a Dynamic API**|Visual reasoning -- the ability to interpret the visual world -- is crucial for embodied agents that operate within three-dimensional scenes. Progress in AI has led to vision and language models capable of answering questions from images. However, their performance declines when tasked with 3D spatial reasoning. To tackle the complexity of such reasoning problems, we introduce an agentic program synthesis approach where LLM agents collaboratively generate a Pythonic API with new functions to solve common subproblems. Our method overcomes limitations of prior approaches that rely on a static, human-defined API, allowing it to handle a wider range of queries. To assess AI capabilities for 3D understanding, we introduce a new benchmark of queries involving multiple steps of grounding and inference. We show that our method outperforms prior zero-shot models for visual reasoning in 3D and empirically validate the effectiveness of our agentic framework for 3D spatial reasoning tasks.

|**2025-02-10**|**Towards Internet-Scale Training For Agents**|The predominant approach for training web navigation agents gathers human demonstrations for a set of popular websites and hand-written tasks, but it is becoming clear that human data are an inefficient resource. We develop a pipeline to facilitate Internet-scale training for agents without laborious human annotations. In the first stage, an LLM generates tasks for 150k diverse websites. In the next stage, LLM agents complete tasks and produce trajectories. In the final stage, an LLM reviews the trajectories and judges their success. Language models are competitive with human annotators, detecting and filtering out harmful content with an accuracy of 97%, generating feasible tasks with an 89% rate, and judging successful trajectories with an 82.6% accuracy. Scaling the pipeline, agents based on Llama 3.1 70B solve 16.7% of tasks for 150k sites. Training on the data generated by our pipeline is competitive with training on human demonstrations. In data-limited settings derived from Mind2Web and WebLINX, we improve Step Accuracy by up to +89.5% and +122.1% respectively for agents trained on mixtures of data from our pipeline, and human data. When training agents with all available human data from these benchmarks, agents fail to generalize to diverse real sites, and adding our data improves their generalization by +149.0% for WebLINX and +156.3% for Mind2Web.

|**2025-02-10**|**On the Emergence of Thinking in LLMs I: Searching for the Right Intuition**|Recent AI advancements, such as OpenAI's new models, are transforming LLMs into LRMs (Large Reasoning Models) that perform reasoning during inference, taking extra time and compute for higher-quality outputs. We aim to uncover the algorithmic framework for training LRMs. Methods like self-consistency, PRM, and AlphaZero suggest reasoning as guided search. We ask: what is the simplest, most scalable way to enable search in LLMs?   We propose a post-training framework called Reinforcement Learning via Self-Play (RLSP). RLSP involves three steps: (1) supervised fine-tuning with human or synthetic demonstrations of the reasoning process, (2) using an exploration reward signal to encourage diverse and efficient reasoning behaviors, and (3) RL training with an outcome verifier to ensure correctness while preventing reward hacking. Our key innovation is to decouple exploration and correctness signals during PPO training, carefully balancing them to improve performance and efficiency.   Empirical studies in the math domain show that RLSP improves reasoning. On the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, RLSP can boost performance by 23% in MATH-500 test set; On AIME 2024 math problems, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct improved by 10% due to RLSP. However, a more important finding of this work is that the models trained using RLSP, even with the simplest exploration reward that encourages the model to take more intermediate steps, showed several emergent behaviors such as backtracking, exploration of ideas, and verification. These findings demonstrate that RLSP framework might be enough to enable emergence of complex reasoning abilities in LLMs when scaled. Lastly, we propose a theory as to why RLSP search strategy is more suitable for LLMs inspired by a remarkable result that says CoT provably increases computational power of LLMs, which grows as the number of steps in CoT \cite{li2024chain,merrill2023expresssive}.|Guanghao Ye et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06773)|null|

We train our ReasonFlux-32B model with only 8 GPUs and introduces three innovations: (i) a structured and generic thought template library, containing around 500 high-level thought templates capable of generalizing to similar or relevant reasoning problems; (ii) performing hierarchical reinforcement learning on a sequence of thought templates instead of long CoTs, optimizing a base LLM to plan out an optimal template trajectory for gradually handling complex problems; (iii) a brand new inference scaling system that enables hierarchical LLM reasoning by adaptively scaling thought templates at inference time. With a template trajectory containing sequential thought templates, our ReasonFlux-32B significantly advances math reasoning capabilities to state-of-the-art levels. Notably, on the MATH benchmark, it achieves an accuracy of 91.2% and surpasses o1-preview by 6.7%.

These rationales consist of intermediate SQL statements and explanations, serving as incremental steps toward constructing the final SQL query. The process begins with manually annotating a small set of examples, which are then used to prompt a large language model in an iterative, dynamic few-shot knowledge distillation procedure from a teacher model. A rationalization model is subsequently trained on the validated decomposed queries, enabling extensive synthetic CoT annotations for text-to-SQL datasets. To evaluate the approach, we fine-tune small language models with and without these rationales on the BIRD dataset. Results indicate that step-by-step query generation improves execution accuracy, especially for moderately and highly complex queries, while also enhancing explainability.|Gaetano Rossiello et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06759)|null|
|**2025-02-10**|**Gradient Multi-Normalization for Stateless and Scalable LLM Training**|Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers like Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) which store additional state information to accelerate convergence but incur significant memory overhead. Recent efforts, such as SWAN (Ma et al., 2024) address this by eliminating the need for optimizer states while achieving performance comparable to Adam via a multi-step preprocessing procedure applied to instantaneous gradients. Motivated by the success of SWAN, we introduce a novel framework for designing stateless optimizers that normalizes stochastic gradients according to multiple norms. To achieve this, we propose a simple alternating scheme to enforce the normalization of gradients w.r.t these norms. We show that our procedure can produce, up to an arbitrary precision, a fixed-point of the problem, and that SWAN is a particular instance of our approach with carefully chosen norms, providing a deeper understanding of its design. However, SWAN's computationally expensive whitening/orthogonalization step limit its practicality for large LMs. Using our principled perspective, we develop of a more efficient, scalable, and practical stateless optimizer. Our algorithm relaxes the properties of SWAN, significantly reducing its computational cost while retaining its memory efficiency, making it applicable to training large-scale models. Experiments on pre-training LLaMA models with up to 1 billion parameters demonstrate a 3X speedup over Adam with significantly reduced memory requirements, outperforming other memory-efficient baselines.|Meyer Scetbon et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06742)|null|

We find that for more capable models, these predictably reduce performance, essentially heightening the performance ceiling of a benchmark and unsaturating it again.

However, they are predominantly trained on mathematical data and their generalizability to non-mathematical domains has not been rigorously studied. In response, this work first shows that current PRMs have poor performance in other domains. To address this limitation, we introduce VersaPRM, a multi-domain PRM trained on synthetic reasoning data generated using our novel data generation and annotation method. VersaPRM achieves consistent performance gains across diverse domains. For instance, in the MMLU-Pro category of Law, VersaPRM via weighted majority voting, achieves a 7.9% performance gain over the majority voting baseline -- surpassing Qwen2.5-Math-PRM's gain of 1.3%.

|**2025-02-10**|**Dynamic Loss-Based Sample Reweighting for Improved Large Language Model Pretraining**|Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on vast and heterogeneous datasets is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream tasks. However, current training paradigms treat all samples equally, overlooking the importance or relevance of individual samples throughout the training process. Existing reweighting strategies, which primarily focus on group-level data importance, fail to leverage fine-grained instance-level information and do not adapt dynamically to individual sample importance as training progresses. In this paper, we introduce novel algorithms for dynamic, instance-level data reweighting aimed at improving both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining. Our methods adjust the weight of each training sample based on its loss value in an online fashion, allowing the model to dynamically focus on more informative or important samples at the current training stage. In particular, our framework allows us to systematically devise reweighting strategies deprioritizing redundant or uninformative data, which we find tend to work best. Furthermore, we develop a new theoretical framework for analyzing the impact of loss-based reweighting on the convergence of gradient-based optimization, providing the first formal characterization of how these strategies affect convergence bounds. We empirically validate our approach across a spectrum of tasks, from pretraining 7B and 1.4B parameter LLMs to smaller-scale language models and linear regression problems, demonstrating that our loss-based reweighting approach can lead to faster convergence and significantly improved performance.|Daouda Sow et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06733)|null|

Rethinking Compute-Optimal Test-Time Scaling**|Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is an important method for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional computation during the inference phase. However, current studies do not systematically analyze how policy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulty influence TTS. This lack of analysis limits the understanding and practical use of TTS methods. In this paper, we focus on two core questions: (1) What is the optimal approach to scale test-time computation across different policy models, PRMs, and problem difficulty levels? (2) To what extent can extended computation improve the performance of LLMs on complex tasks, and can smaller language models outperform larger ones through this approach? Through comprehensive experiments on MATH-500 and challenging AIME24 tasks, we have the following observations: (1) The compute-optimal TTS strategy is highly dependent on the choice of policy model, PRM, and problem difficulty. (2) With our compute-optimal TTS strategy, extremely small policy models can outperform larger models. For example, a 1B LLM can exceed a 405B LLM on MATH-500. Moreover, on both MATH-500 and AIME24, a 0.5B LLM outperforms GPT-4o, a 3B LLM surpasses a 405B LLM, and a 7B LLM beats o1 and DeepSeek-R1, while with higher inference efficiency. These findings show the significance of adapting TTS strategies to the specific characteristics of each task and model and indicate that TTS is a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.|Runze Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06703)|null|

We introduce Long-VITA, a simple yet effective large multi-modal model for long-context visual-language understanding tasks. It is adept at concurrently processing and analyzing modalities of image, video, and text over 4K frames or 1M tokens while delivering advanced performances on short-context multi-modal tasks.

Regarding training data, Long-VITA is built on a mix of $17$ M samples from public datasets only and demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on various multi-modal benchmarks, compared against recent cutting-edge models with internal data. Long-VITA is fully reproducible and supports both NPU and GPU platforms for training and testing.

|**2025-02-07**|**MELON: Indirect Prompt Injection Defense via Masked Re-execution and Tool Comparison**|Recent research has explored that LLM agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious tasks embedded in tool-retrieved information can redirect the agent to take unauthorized actions. Existing defenses against IPI have significant limitations: either require essential model training resources, lack effectiveness against sophisticated attacks, or harm the normal utilities. We present MELON (Masked re-Execution and TooL comparisON), a novel IPI defense. Our approach builds on the observation that under a successful attack, the agent's next action becomes less dependent on user tasks and more on malicious tasks. Following this, we design MELON to detect attacks by re-executing the agent's trajectory with a masked user prompt modified through a masking function. We identify an attack if the actions generated in the original and masked executions are similar. We also include three key designs to reduce the potential false positives and false negatives. Extensive evaluation on the IPI benchmark AgentDojo demonstrates that MELON outperforms SOTA defenses in both attack prevention and utility preservation. Moreover, we show that combining MELON with a SOTA prompt augmentation defense (denoted as MELON-Aug) further improves its performance. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate our key designs.|Kaijie Zhu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05174)|null|
|**2025-02-07**|**NoLiMa: Long-Context Evaluation Beyond Literal Matching**|Recent large language models (LLMs) support long contexts ranging from 128K to 1M tokens. A popular method for evaluating these capabilities is the needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test, which involves retrieving a "needle" (relevant information) from a "haystack" (long irrelevant context). Extensions of this approach include increasing distractors, fact chaining, and in-context reasoning. However, in these benchmarks, models can exploit existing literal matches between the needle and haystack to simplify the task. To address this, we introduce NoLiMa, a benchmark extending NIAH with a carefully designed needle set, where questions and needles have minimal lexical overlap, requiring models to infer latent associations to locate the needle within the haystack. We evaluate 12 popular LLMs that claim to support contexts of at least 128K tokens. While they perform well in short contexts (<1K), performance degrades significantly as context length increases. At 32K, for instance, 10 models drop below 50% of their strong short-length baselines. Even GPT-4o, one of the top-performing exceptions, experiences a reduction from an almost-perfect baseline of 99.3% to 69.7%. Our analysis suggests these declines stem from the increased difficulty the attention mechanism faces in longer contexts when literal matches are absent, making it harder to retrieve relevant information.|Ali Modarressi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05167)|null|

While substantial safety data exist in English, multilingual guardrail modeling remains underexplored due to the scarcity of open-source safety data in other languages. To address this gap, we propose a novel two-player Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, where a generator and a guardrail model co-evolve adversarially to produce high-quality synthetic data for multilingual guardrail training. We theoretically formalize this interaction as a two-player game, proving convergence to a Nash equilibrium. Empirical evaluations show that our model \ours outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving nearly 10% improvement over LlamaGuard3 (8B) on English benchmarks while being 4.5x faster at inference with a significantly smaller model (0.5B). We achieve substantial advancements in multilingual safety tasks, particularly in addressing the imbalance for lower-resource languages in a collected real dataset. Ablation studies emphasize the critical role of synthetic data generation in bridging the imbalance in open-source data between English and other languages.

|**2025-02-07**|**A Lightweight Method to Disrupt Memorized Sequences in LLM**|Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across many tasks yet risk reproducing copyrighted content verbatim, raising legal and ethical concerns. Although methods like differential privacy or neuron editing can reduce memorization, they typically require costly retraining or direct access to model weights and may degrade performance. To address these challenges, we propose TokenSwap, a lightweight, post-hoc approach that replaces the probabilities of grammar-related tokens with those from a small auxiliary model (e.g., DistilGPT-2). We run extensive experiments on commercial grade models such as Pythia-6.9b and LLaMA-3-8b and demonstrate that our method effectively reduces well-known cases of memorized generation by upto 10x with little to no impact on downstream tasks. Our approach offers a uniquely accessible and effective solution to users of real-world systems.|Parjanya Prajakta Prashant et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05159)|null|
|**2025-02-07**|**Transforming Science with Large Language Models: A Survey on AI-assisted Scientific Discovery, Experimentation, Content Generation, and Evaluation**|With the advent of large multimodal language models, science is now at a threshold of an AI-based technological transformation. Recently, a plethora of new AI models and tools has been proposed, promising to empower researchers and academics worldwide to conduct their research more effectively and efficiently. This includes all aspects of the research cycle, especially (1) searching for relevant literature; (2) generating research ideas and conducting experimentation; generating (3) text-based and (4) multimodal content (e.g., scientific figures and diagrams); and (5) AI-based automatic peer review. In this survey, we provide an in-depth overview over these exciting recent developments, which promise to fundamentally alter the scientific research process for good. Our survey covers the five aspects outlined above, indicating relevant datasets, methods and results (including evaluation) as well as limitations and scope for future research. Ethical concerns regarding shortcomings of these tools and potential for misuse (fake science, plagiarism, harms to research integrity) take a particularly prominent place in our discussion. We hope that our survey will not only become a reference guide for newcomers to the field but also a catalyst for new AI-based initiatives in the area of "AI4Science".|Steffen Eger et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05151)|null|
|**2025-02-07**|**CodeSCM: Causal Analysis for Multi-Modal Code Generation**|In this paper, we propose CodeSCM, a Structural Causal Model (SCM) for analyzing multi-modal code generation using large language models (LLMs). By applying interventions to CodeSCM, we measure the causal effects of different prompt modalities, such as natural language, code, and input-output examples, on the model. CodeSCM introduces latent mediator variables to separate the code and natural language semantics of a multi-modal code generation prompt. Using the principles of Causal Mediation Analysis on these mediators we quantify direct effects representing the model's spurious leanings. We find that, in addition to natural language instructions, input-output examples significantly influence code generation.|Mukur Gupta et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05150)|null|

|**2025-02-07**|**pyMethods2Test: A Dataset of Python Tests Mapped to Focal Methods**|Python is one of the fastest-growing programming languages and currently ranks as the top language in many lists, even recently overtaking JavaScript as the top language on GitHub. Given its importance in data science and machine learning, it is imperative to be able to effectively train LLMs to generate good unit test cases for Python code. This motivates the need for a large dataset to provide training and testing data. To date, while other large datasets exist for languages like Java, none publicly exist for Python. Python poses difficult challenges in generating such a dataset, due to its less rigid naming requirements. In this work, we consider two commonly used Python unit testing frameworks: Pytest and unittest. We analyze a large corpus of over 88K open-source GitHub projects utilizing these testing frameworks. Using a carefully designed set of heuristics, we are able to locate over 22 million test methods. We then analyze the test and non-test code and map individual unit tests to the focal method being tested. This provides an explicit traceability link from the test to the tested method. Our pyMethods2Test dataset contains over 2 million of these focal method mappings, as well as the ability to generate useful context for input to LLMs. The pyMethods2Test dataset is publicly available on Zenodo at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14264518|Idriss Abdelmadjid et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05143)|null|

In this paper, we investigate the use of machine-learning techniques to find improved heuristics. We use funsearch, a genetic programming variant based on code generation by a Large Language Model, in order to explore possible approaches, then use strongly typed genetic programming to zero in on useful solutions. Both approaches manage to re-discover the state-of-the-art heuristics recently incorporated into integration-by-parts solvers, and in one example find a small advance on this state of the art.|Matt von Hippel et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05121)|null|
|**2025-02-06**|**Ola: Pushing the Frontiers of Omni-Modal Language Model with Progressive Modality Alignment**|Recent advances in large language models, particularly following GPT-4o, have sparked increasing interest in developing omni-modal models capable of understanding more modalities. While some open-source alternatives have emerged, there is still a notable lag behind specialized single-modality models in performance. In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal language model that achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio understanding compared to specialized counterparts. The core design of Ola lies in its progressive modality alignment strategy that extends the supporting modality of the language model progressively. Our training pipeline begins with the most distinct modalities: image and text, then gradually expands the skill sets of the model using speech data that connects language and audio knowledge, and video data that connects all modalities. The progressive learning pipeline also enables us to maintain a relatively small size of the cross-modal alignment data, making developing omni-modal from existing vision-language models easy and less costly. Moreover, to unlock an advanced interactive experience like GPT-4o, we further design a sentence-wise decoding solution for streaming speech generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola surpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models of similar sizes. We aim to make Ola a fully open omni-modal understanding solution to advance future research in this emerging field.

In contrast to existing benchmarks, our WorldSense has several features: (i) collaboration of omni-modality, we design the evaluation tasks to feature a strong coupling of audio and video, requiring models to effectively utilize the synergistic perception of omni-modality; (ii) diversity of videos and tasks, WorldSense encompasses a diverse collection of 1,662 audio-visual synchronised videos, systematically categorized into 8 primary domains and 67 fine-grained subcategories to cover the broad scenarios, and 3,172 multi-choice QA pairs across 26 distinct tasks to enable the comprehensive evaluation; (iii) high-quality annotations, all the QA pairs are manually labeled by 80 expert annotators with multiple rounds of correction to ensure quality. Based on our WorldSense, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art models. The experimental results indicate that existing models face significant challenges in understanding real-world scenarios (48.0% best accuracy).

|**2025-02-06**|**Speak Easy: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions**|Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful behavior. While existing studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical expertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken responses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions? (2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM interactions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively facilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two attributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this insight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively an LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step, multilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct request and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319 in Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and proprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet often overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common interaction patterns for harmful intentions.|Yik Siu Chan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04322)|null|
|**2025-02-06**|**ChamaleonLLM: Batch-Aware Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation via Inference-Time Clusters**|Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse tasks. However, these models are typically deployed with fixed weights, which limits their ability to adapt dynamically to the variability inherent in real-world data during inference. This paper introduces ChamaleonLLM, a novel framework that enables inference-time adaptation of LLMs by leveraging batch-aware clustering and on-the-fly generation of low-rank updates. Unlike traditional fine-tuning approaches such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or methods that rely on a fixed set of pre-learned uniforms (changeable masks), our method dynamically generates adaptive modifications to the decoder weights based on the aggregated statistics of clustered batches. By intelligently grouping similar inputs and computing context-aware low-rank updates via a hyper-network, ChamaleonLLM achieves significant performance gains, outperforming conventional LoRA methods while eliminating the overhead of maintaining multiple expert models. Our experiments highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a versatile and highly adaptive solution for language model inference.

|**2025-02-06**|**Great Models Think Alike and this Undermines AI Oversight**|As Language Model (LM) capabilities advance, evaluating and supervising them at scale is getting harder for humans. There is hope that other language models can automate both these tasks, which we refer to as "AI Oversight". We study how model similarity affects both aspects of AI oversight by proposing a probabilistic metric for LM similarity based on overlap in model mistakes. Using this metric, we first show that LLM-as-a-judge scores favor models similar to the judge, generalizing recent self-preference results. Then, we study training on LM annotations, and find complementary knowledge between the weak supervisor and strong student model plays a crucial role in gains from "weak-to-strong generalization". As model capabilities increase, it becomes harder to find their mistakes, and we might defer more to AI oversight. However, we observe a concerning trend -- model mistakes are becoming more similar with increasing capabilities, pointing to risks from correlated failures. Our work underscores the importance of reporting and correcting for model similarity, especially in the emerging paradigm of AI oversight.|Shashwat Goel et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04313)|**[link](https://github.com/model-similarity/lm-similarity/tree/main/applications)**|

However, existing methods remain inflexible due to representational limitations, a lack of adaptability, and poor scalability when relying on discrete optimization techniques. We address these challenges with ScoreFlow, a simple yet high-performance framework that leverages efficient gradient-based optimization in a continuous space. ScoreFlow incorporates Score-DPO, a novel variant of the direct preference optimization method that accounts for quantitative feedback. Across six benchmarks spanning question answering, coding, and mathematical reasoning, ScoreFlow achieves an 8.2% improvement over existing baselines. Moreover, it empowers smaller models to outperform larger ones with lower inference costs.

While recent research has focused on optimizing prompt content, the role of prompt formatting, a critical but often overlooked dimension, has received limited systematic investigation. In this paper, we introduce Content-Format Integrated Prompt Optimization (CFPO), an innovative methodology that jointly optimizes both prompt content and formatting through an iterative refinement process. CFPO leverages natural language mutations to explore content variations and employs a dynamic format exploration strategy that systematically evaluates diverse format options. Our extensive evaluations across multiple tasks and open-source LLMs demonstrate that CFPO demonstrates measurable performance improvements compared to content-only optimization methods. This highlights the importance of integrated content-format optimization and offers a practical, model-agnostic approach to enhancing LLM performance.

|**2025-02-06**|**PILAF: Optimal Human Preference Sampling for Reward Modeling**|As large language models increasingly drive real-world applications, aligning them with human values becomes paramount. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique, translating preference data into reward models when oracle human values remain inaccessible. In practice, RLHF mostly relies on approximate reward models, which may not consistently guide the policy toward maximizing the underlying human values. We propose Policy-Interpolated Learning for Aligned Feedback (PILAF), a novel response sampling strategy for preference labeling that explicitly aligns preference learning with maximizing the underlying oracle reward. PILAF is theoretically grounded, demonstrating optimality from both an optimization and a statistical perspective. The method is straightforward to implement and demonstrates strong performance in iterative and online RLHF settings where feedback curation is critical.|Yunzhen Feng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04270)|null|
|**2025-02-06**|**Combining Language and App UI Analysis for the Automated Assessment of Bug Reproduction Steps**|Bug reports are essential for developers to confirm software problems, investigate their causes, and validate fixes. Unfortunately, reports often miss important information or are written unclearly, which can cause delays, increased issue resolution effort, or even the inability to solve issues. One of the most common components of reports that are problematic is the steps to reproduce the bug(s) (S2Rs), which are essential to replicate the described program failures and reason about fixes. Given the proclivity for deficiencies in reported S2Rs, prior work has proposed techniques that assist reporters in writing or assessing the quality of S2Rs. However, automated understanding of S2Rs is challenging, and requires linking nuanced natural language phrases with specific, semantically related program information. Prior techniques often struggle to form such language to program connections - due to issues in language variability and limitations of information gleaned from program analyses.   To more effectively tackle the problem of S2R quality annotation, we propose a new technique called AstroBR, which leverages the language understanding capabilities of LLMs to identify and extract the S2Rs from bug reports and map them to GUI interactions in a program state model derived via dynamic analysis. We compared AstroBR to a related state-of-the-art approach and we found that AstroBR annotates S2Rs 25.2% better (in terms of F1 score) than the baseline. Additionally, AstroBR suggests more accurate missing S2Rs than the baseline (by 71.4% in terms of F1 score).|Junayed Mahmud et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04251)|null|

While model architectures continue to evolve, the natural language data struggles to scale up. To tackle this bottleneck, we propose \textbf{MA}ssive \textbf{G}enre-\textbf{A}udience~(MAGA) reformulation method, which systematic synthesizes diverse, contextually-rich pretraining data from existing corpus. This work makes three main contributions: (1) We propose MAGA reformulation method, a lightweight and scalable approach for pretraining corpus expansion, and build a 770B tokens MAGACorpus. (2) We evaluate MAGACorpus with different data budget scaling strategies, demonstrating consistent improvements across various model sizes (134M-13B), establishing the necessity for next-generation large-scale synthetic pretraining language models. (3) Through comprehensive analysis, we investigate prompt engineering's impact on synthetic training collapse and reveal limitations in conventional collapse detection metrics using validation losses. Our work shows that MAGA can substantially expand training datasets while maintaining quality, offering a reliably pathway for scaling models beyond data limitations.|Xintong Hao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04235)|null|
|**2025-02-05**|**Do Large Language Model Benchmarks Test Reliability?**|When deploying large language models (LLMs), it is important to ensure that these models are not only capable, but also reliable. Many benchmarks have been created to track LLMs' growing capabilities, however there has been no similar focus on measuring their reliability. To understand the potential ramifications of this gap, we investigate how well current benchmarks quantify model reliability. We find that pervasive label errors can compromise these evaluations, obscuring lingering model failures and hiding unreliable behavior.   Motivated by this gap in the evaluation of reliability, we then propose the concept of so-called platinum benchmarks, i.e., benchmarks carefully curated to minimize label errors and ambiguity. As a first attempt at constructing such benchmarks, we revise examples from fifteen existing popular benchmarks. We evaluate a wide range of models on these platinum benchmarks and find that, indeed, frontier LLMs still exhibit failures on simple tasks such as elementary-level math word problems. Analyzing these failures further reveals previously unidentified patterns of problems on which frontier models consistently struggle.

|**2025-02-05**|**Adapt-Pruner: Adaptive Structural Pruning for Efficient Small Language Model Training**|Small language models (SLMs) have attracted considerable attention from both academia and industry due to their broad range of applications in edge devices. To obtain SLMs with strong performance, conventional approaches either pre-train the models from scratch, which incurs substantial computational costs, or compress/prune existing large language models (LLMs), which results in performance drops and falls short in comparison to pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the family of acceleration methods that involve both structured pruning and model training. We found 1) layer-wise adaptive pruning (Adapt-Pruner) is extremely effective in LLMs and yields significant improvements over existing pruning techniques, 2) adaptive pruning equipped with further training leads to models comparable to those pre-training from scratch, 3) incremental pruning brings non-trivial performance gain by interleaving pruning with training and only removing a small portion of neurons ( $\sim$5%) at a time. Experimental results on LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that Adapt-Pruner outperforms conventional pruning methods, such as LLM-Pruner, FLAP, and SliceGPT, by an average of 1%-7% in accuracy on commonsense benchmarks. Additionally, Adapt-Pruner restores the performance of MobileLLM-125M to 600M on the MMLU benchmark with 200$\times$ fewer tokens via pruning from its larger counterparts, and discovers a new 1B model that surpasses LLaMA-3.2-1B in multiple benchmarks.|Boyao Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03460)|null|
|**2025-02-05**|**A Schema-Guided Reason-while-Retrieve framework for Reasoning on Scene Graphs with Large-Language-Models (LLMs)**|Scene graphs have emerged as a structured and serializable environment representation for grounded spatial reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we propose SG-RwR, a Schema-Guided Retrieve-while-Reason framework for reasoning and planning with scene graphs. Our approach employs two cooperative, code-writing LLM agents: a (1) Reasoner for task planning and information queries generation, and a (2) Retriever for extracting corresponding graph information following the queries. Two agents collaborate iteratively, enabling sequential reasoning and adaptive attention to graph information. Unlike prior works, both agents are prompted only with the scene graph schema rather than the full graph data, which reduces the hallucination by limiting input tokens, and drives the Reasoner to generate reasoning trace abstractly.Following the trace, the Retriever programmatically query the scene graph data based on the schema understanding, allowing dynamic and global attention on the graph that enhances alignment between reasoning and retrieval. Through experiments in multiple simulation environments, we show that our framework surpasses existing LLM-based approaches in numerical Q\&A and planning tasks, and can benefit from task-level few-shot examples, even in the absence of agent-level demonstrations.

|**2025-02-05**|**Designing LLM-simulated Immersive Spaces to Enhance Autistic Children's Social Affordances Understanding**|One of the key challenges faced by autistic children is understanding social affordances in complex environments, which further impacts their ability to respond appropriately to social signals. In traffic scenarios, this impairment can even lead to safety concerns. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-simulated immersive projection environment designed to improve this ability in autistic children while ensuring their safety. We first propose 17 design considerations across four major categories, derived from a comprehensive review of previous research. Next, we developed a system called AIroad, which leverages LLMs to simulate drivers with varying social intents, expressed through explicit multimodal social signals. AIroad helps autistic children bridge the gap in recognizing the intentions behind behaviors and learning appropriate responses through various stimuli. A user study involving 14 participants demonstrated that this technology effectively engages autistic children and leads to significant improvements in their comprehension of social affordances in traffic scenarios. Additionally, parents reported high perceived usability of the system. These findings highlight the potential of combining LLM technology with immersive environments for the functional rehabilitation of autistic children in the future.|Yancheng Cao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03447)|null|
|**2025-02-05**|**BFS-Prover: Scalable Best-First Tree Search for LLM-based Automatic Theorem Proving**|Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in automatic theorem proving using Lean4, where effective tree search methods are crucial for navigating proof search spaces. While the existing approaches primarily rely on value functions and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), the potential of simpler methods like Best-First Search (BFS) remains underexplored. This paper investigates whether BFS can achieve competitive performance in large-scale theorem proving tasks. We present \texttt{BFS-Prover}, a scalable expert iteration framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we implement strategic data filtering at each expert iteration round, excluding problems solvable via beam search node expansion to focus on harder cases. Second, we improve the sample efficiency of BFS through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied to state-tactic pairs automatically annotated with compiler error feedback, refining the LLM's policy to prioritize productive expansions. Third, we employ length normalization in BFS to encourage exploration of deeper proof paths. \texttt{BFS-Prover} achieves a score of $71.31$ on the MiniF2F test set and therefore challenges the perceived necessity of complex tree search methods, demonstrating that BFS can achieve competitive performance when properly scaled.|Ran Xin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03438)|null|
|**2025-02-05**|**On Fairness of Unified Multimodal Large Language Model for Image Generation**|Unified multimodal large language models (U-MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in visual understanding and generation in an end-to-end pipeline. Compared with generation-only models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), U-MLLMs may raise new questions about bias in their outputs, which can be affected by their unified capabilities. This gap is particularly concerning given the under-explored risk of propagating harmful stereotypes. In this paper, we benchmark the latest U-MLLMs and find that most exhibit significant demographic biases, such as gender and race bias. To better understand and mitigate this issue, we propose a locate-then-fix strategy, where we audit and show how the individual model component is affected by bias. Our analysis shows that bias originates primarily from the language model. More interestingly, we observe a "partial alignment" phenomenon in U-MLLMs, where understanding bias appears minimal, but generation bias remains substantial. Thus, we propose a novel balanced preference model to balance the demographic distribution with synthetic data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces demographic bias while preserving semantic fidelity. We hope our findings underscore the need for more holistic interpretation and debiasing strategies of U-MLLMs in the future.|Ming Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03429)|null|
|**2025-02-05**|**Harnessing Large Language Models for Curated Code Reviews**|In code review, generating structured and relevant comments is crucial for identifying code issues and facilitating accurate code changes that ensure an efficient code review process. Well-crafted comments not only streamline the code review itself but are also essential for subsequent tasks like code refinement, where the code is modified to satisfy the input review comment. Although various AI-based approaches aimed to automate comment generation, their effectiveness remains limited by the quality of the training data. Existing code review datasets are often noisy and unrefined, posing limitations to the learning potential of AI models and hindering the automation process.   To address these challenges, we propose a curation pipeline designed to enhance the quality of the largest publicly available code review dataset. We begin by establishing an evaluation framework, incorporating specific criteria and categories to empirically study the initial quality of the dataset. Using a large language model (LLM)-driven approach, we then apply our curation pipeline to refine the dataset. A comparative analysis of the newly curated dataset, based on the same evaluation framework, demonstrates substantial improvements in the clarity and conciseness of the comments. Additionally, we assess the impact of the curated dataset on automating downstream tasks, specifically comment generation and code refinement. Our findings show that the curated dataset leads to enhanced model performance in generating more accurate comments. Curated comments are also more useful as they lead to more accurate code refinement.|Oussama Ben Sghaier et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03425)|null|
|**2025-02-05**|**Think or Step-by-Step? UnZIPping the Black Box in Zero-Shot Prompts**|Zero-shot prompting techniques have significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we lack a clear understanding of why zero-shot prompts are so effective. For example, in the prompt "Let's think step-by-step," is "think" or "step-by-step" more crucial to its success? Existing interpretability methods, such as gradient-based and attention-based approaches, are computationally intensive and restricted to open-source models. We introduce the ZIP score (Zero-shot Importance of Perturbation score), a versatile metric applicable to both open and closed-source models, based on systematic input word perturbations. Our experiments across four recent LLMs, seven widely-used prompts, and several tasks, reveal interesting patterns in word importance. For instance, while both 'step-by-step' and 'think' show high ZIP scores, which one is more influential depends on the model and task. We validate our method using controlled experiments and compare our results with human judgments, finding that proprietary models align more closely with human intuition regarding word significance. These findings enhance our understanding of LLM behavior and contribute to developing more effective zero-shot prompts and improved model analysis.|Nikta Gohari Sadr et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03418)|null|
|**2025-02-05**|**SPRI: Aligning Large Language Models with Context-Situated Principles**|Aligning Large Language Models to integrate and reflect human values, especially for tasks that demand intricate human oversight, is arduous since it is resource-intensive and time-consuming to depend on human expertise for context-specific guidance. Prior work has utilized predefined sets of rules or principles to steer the behavior of models (Bai et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023). However, these principles tend to be generic, making it challenging to adapt them to each individual input query or context. In this work, we present Situated-PRInciples (SPRI), a framework requiring minimal or no human effort that is designed to automatically generate guiding principles in real-time for each input query and utilize them to align each response. We evaluate SPRI on three tasks, and show that 1) SPRI can derive principles in a complex domain-specific task that leads to on-par performance as expert-crafted ones; 2) SPRI-generated principles lead to instance-specific rubrics that outperform prior LLM-as-a-judge frameworks; 3) using SPRI to generate synthetic SFT data leads to substantial improvement on truthfulness.

|**2025-02-05**|**LIMO: Less is More for Reasoning**|We present a fundamental discovery that challenges our understanding of how complex reasoning emerges in large language models. While conventional wisdom suggests that sophisticated reasoning tasks demand extensive training data (>100,000 examples), we demonstrate that complex mathematical reasoning abilities can be effectively elicited with surprisingly few examples. Through comprehensive experiments, our proposed model LIMO demonstrates unprecedented performance in mathematical reasoning. With merely 817 curated training samples, LIMO achieves 57.1% accuracy on AIME and 94.8% on MATH, improving from previous SFT-based models' 6.5% and 59.2% respectively, while only using 1% of the training data required by previous approaches. LIMO demonstrates exceptional out-of-distribution generalization, achieving 40.5% absolute improvement across 10 diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x more data, challenging the notion that SFT leads to memorization rather than generalization. Based on these results, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning capabilities can emerge through minimal but precisely orchestrated demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis posits that the elicitation threshold for complex reasoning is determined by two key factors: (1) the completeness of the model's encoded knowledge foundation during pre-training, and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples as "cognitive templates" that show the model how to utilize its knowledge base to solve complex reasoning tasks. To facilitate reproducibility and future research in data-efficient reasoning, we release LIMO as a comprehensive open-source suite at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/LIMO.|Yixin Ye et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03387)|null|
|**2025-02-04**|**A comparison of translation performance between DeepL and Supertext**|As strong machine translation (MT) systems are increasingly based on large language models (LLMs), reliable quality benchmarking requires methods that capture their ability to leverage extended context. This study compares two commercial MT systems -- DeepL and Supertext -- by assessing their performance on unsegmented texts. We evaluate translation quality across four language directions with professional translators assessing segments with full document-level context. While segment-level assessments indicate no strong preference between the systems in most cases, document-level analysis reveals a preference for Supertext in three out of four language directions, suggesting superior consistency across longer texts. We advocate for more context-sensitive evaluation methodologies to ensure that MT quality assessments reflect real-world usability. We release all evaluation data and scripts for further analysis and reproduction at https://github.com/supertext/evaluation_deepl_supertext.|Alex Flückiger et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02577)|null|

From Evaluation to a Hegelian-Inspired Enhancement**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across numerous fields, presenting an opportunity to revolutionize optimization problem-solving, a crucial, ubiquitous, and complex domain. This paper explores the proficiency of LLMs in handling Sequential Optimization Problems (SOPs). We introduce WorldGen, a dynamic framework for generating unseen SOPs with controllable complexities, to evaluate LLM performance. Our initial observations reveal that while LLMs perform well on simple SOPs, their performance significantly degrades with increased complexity. Motivated by this, we revisit philosophical hypotheses on reasoning to enhance LLM performance. Inspired by the influential framework of Hegelian Dialectics, we propose ACE, demonstrating how the performance of LLMs in SOP contexts can be significantly improved without any retraining or further fine-tuning.|Soheil Abbasloo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02573)|null|

STRING extends Rotary Position Encodings, a recently proposed and widely used algorithm in large language models, via a unifying theoretical framework. Importantly, STRING still provides exact translation invariance, including token coordinates of arbitrary dimensionality, whilst maintaining a low computational footprint. These properties are especially important in robotics, where efficient 3D token representation is key. We integrate STRING into Vision Transformers with RGB(-D) inputs (color plus optional depth), showing substantial gains, e.g. in open-vocabulary object detection and for robotics controllers.

The adversary performs an OVERTHINK attack by injecting decoy reasoning problems into the public content that is used by the reasoning LLM (e.g., for RAG applications) during inference time. Due to the nature of our decoy problems (e.g., a Markov Decision Process), modified texts do not violate safety guardrails. We evaluated our attack across closed-(OpenAI o1, o1-mini, o3-mini) and open-(DeepSeek R1) weights reasoning models on the FreshQA and SQuAD datasets. Our results show up to 46x slowdown and high transferability of the attack across models. To protect applications, we discuss and implement defenses leveraging LLM-based and system design approaches. Finally, we discuss societal, financial, and energy impacts of OVERTHINK attack which could amplify the costs for third party applications operating reasoning models.|Abhinav Kumar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02542)|null|

However, this generation has been limited to code snippets. Going one step further, our desideratum is to automatically generate architectural components. This would not only speed up development time, but would also enable us to eventually completely skip the development phase, moving directly from design decisions to deployment. To this end, we conduct an exploratory study on the capability of LLMs to generate architectural components for Functions as a Service (FaaS), commonly known as serverless functions. The small size of their architectural components make this architectural style amenable for generation using current LLMs compared to other styles like monoliths and microservices. We perform the study by systematically selecting open source serverless repositories, masking a serverless function and utilizing state of the art LLMs provided with varying levels of context information about the overall system to generate the masked function. We evaluate correctness through existing tests present in the repositories and use metrics from the Software Engineering (SE) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) domains to evaluate code quality and the degree of similarity between human and LLM generated code respectively. Along with our findings, we also present a discussion on the path forward for using GenAI in architectural component generation.|Shrikara Arun et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02539)|null|
|**2025-02-04**|**Adaptive Self-improvement LLM Agentic System for ML Library Development**|ML libraries, often written in architecture-specific programming languages (ASPLs) that target domain-specific architectures, are key to efficient ML systems. However, writing these high-performance ML libraries is challenging because it requires expert knowledge of ML algorithms and the ASPL. Large language models (LLMs), on the other hand, have shown general coding capabilities. However, challenges remain when using LLMs for generating ML libraries using ASPLs because 1) this task is complicated even for experienced human programmers and 2) there are limited code examples because of the esoteric and evolving nature of ASPLs. Therefore, LLMs need complex reasoning with limited data in order to complete this task. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive self-improvement agentic system. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we construct a benchmark of a typical ML library and generate ASPL code with both open and closed-source LLMs on this benchmark. Our results show improvements of up to $3.9\times$ over a baseline single LLM.|Genghan Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02534)|null|
|**2025-02-04**|**Multi-Agent Design: Optimizing Agents with Better Prompts and Topologies**|Large language models, employed as multiple agents that interact and collaborate with each other, have excelled at solving complex tasks. The agents are programmed with prompts that declare their functionality, along with the topologies that orchestrate interactions across agents. Designing prompts and topologies for multi-agent systems (MAS) is inherently complex. To automate the entire design process, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the design space aiming to understand the factors behind building effective MAS. We reveal that prompts together with topologies play critical roles in enabling more effective MAS design. Based on the insights, we propose Multi-Agent System Search (MASS), a MAS optimization framework that efficiently exploits the complex MAS design space by interleaving its optimization stages, from local to global, from prompts to topologies, over three stages: 1) block-level (local) prompt optimization; 2) workflow topology optimization; 3) workflow-level (global) prompt optimization, where each stage is conditioned on the iteratively optimized prompts/topologies from former stages. We show that MASS-optimized multi-agent systems outperform a spectrum of existing alternatives by a substantial margin. Based on the MASS-found systems, we finally propose design principles behind building effective multi-agent systems.|Han Zhou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02533)|null|
|**2025-02-04**|**Satori: Reinforcement Learning with Chain-of-Action-Thought Enhances LLM Reasoning via Autoregressive Search**|Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Recent studies have shown that increasing test-time computation enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This typically involves extensive sampling at inference time guided by an external LLM verifier, resulting in a two-player system. Despite external guidance, the effectiveness of this system demonstrates the potential of a single LLM to tackle complex tasks. Thus, we pose a new research problem: Can we internalize the searching capabilities to fundamentally enhance the reasoning abilities of a single LLM? This work explores an orthogonal direction focusing on post-training LLMs for autoregressive searching (i.e., an extended reasoning process with self-reflection and self-exploration of new strategies). To achieve this, we propose the Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) reasoning and a two-stage training paradigm: 1) a small-scale format tuning stage to internalize the COAT reasoning format and 2) a large-scale self-improvement stage leveraging reinforcement learning. Our approach results in Satori, a 7B LLM trained on open-source models and data. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Satori achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.|Maohao Shen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02508)|null|
|**2025-02-04**|**EasySpec: Layer-Parallel Speculative Decoding for Efficient Multi-GPU Utilization**|Speculative decoding is an effective and lossless method for Large Language Model (LLM) inference acceleration. It employs a smaller model to generate a draft token sequence, which is then verified by the original base model. In multi-GPU systems, inference latency can be further reduced through tensor parallelism (TP), while the optimal TP size of the draft model is typically smaller than that of the base model, leading to GPU idling during the drafting stage. To solve this problem, we propose EasySpec, a layer-parallel speculation strategy that optimizes the efficiency of multi-GPU utilization.EasySpec breaks the sequential execution order of layers in the drafting model, enabling multi-layer parallelization across devices, albeit with some induced approximation errors. After each drafting-and-verification iteration, the draft model's key-value (KV) cache is calibrated in a single forward pass, preventing long-term error accumulation at minimal additional latency. We evaluated EasySpec on several mainstream open-source LLMs, using smaller versions of models from the same series as drafters. The results demonstrate that EasySpec can achieve a peak speedup of 4.17x compared to vanilla decoding, while preserving the original distribution of the base LLMs. Specifically, the drafting stage can be accelerated by up to 1.62x with a maximum accuracy drop of only 7%, requiring no training or fine-tuning on the draft models.|Yize Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02493)|null|

However, the scalability of ICRL beyond toy tasks and single-domain settings remains an open challenge. In this work, we present the first steps toward scaling ICRL by introducing a fixed, cross-domain model capable of learning behaviors through in-context reinforcement learning. Our results demonstrate that Algorithm Distillation, a framework designed to facilitate ICRL, offers a compelling and competitive alternative to expert distillation to construct versatile action models. These findings highlight the potential of ICRL as a scalable approach for generalist decision-making systems.

|**2025-01-31**|**Do LLMs Strategically Reveal, Conceal, and Infer Information? A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis in The Chameleon Game**|Large language model-based (LLM-based) agents have become common in settings that include non-cooperative parties. In such settings, agents' decision-making needs to conceal information from their adversaries, reveal information to their cooperators, and infer information to identify the other agents' characteristics. To investigate whether LLMs have these information control and decision-making capabilities, we make LLM agents play the language-based hidden-identity game, The Chameleon. In the game, a group of non-chameleon agents who do not know each other aim to identify the chameleon agent without revealing a secret. The game requires the aforementioned information control capabilities both as a chameleon and a non-chameleon. The empirical results show that while non-chameleon LLM agents identify the chameleon, they fail to conceal the secret from the chameleon, and their winning probability is far from the levels of even trivial strategies. To formally explain this behavior, we give a theoretical analysis for a spectrum of strategies, from concealing to revealing, and provide bounds on the non-chameleons' winning probability. Based on the empirical results and theoretical analysis of different strategies, we deduce that LLM-based non-chameleon agents reveal excessive information to agents of unknown identities. Our results point to a weakness of contemporary LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, in strategic interactions.|Mustafa O.

|**2025-01-31**|**Cache Me If You Must: Adaptive Key-Value Quantization for Large Language Models**|Efficient real-world deployments of large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) caching for processing and generating long outputs, reducing the need for repetitive computation. For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take up tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for each token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to "optimally" compress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art LLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5 bits per value with under $1\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench scores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a single GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.|Alina Shutova et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19392)|null|
|**2025-01-31**|**Federated Sketching LoRA: On-Device Collaborative Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models**|Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on devices is attracting increasing interest. Recent works have fused low-rank adaptation (LoRA) techniques with federated fine-tuning to mitigate challenges associated with device model sizes and data scarcity. Still, the heterogeneity of computational resources remains a critical bottleneck: while higher-rank modules generally enhance performance, varying device capabilities constrain LoRA's feasible rank range. Existing approaches attempting to resolve this issue either lack analytical justification or impose additional computational overhead, leaving a wide gap for an efficient and theoretically-grounded solution. To address these challenges, we propose federated sketching LoRA (FSLoRA), which leverages a sketching mechanism to enable devices to selectively update submatrices of global LoRA modules maintained by the server. By adjusting the sketching ratios, which determine the ranks of the submatrices on the devices, FSLoRA flexibly adapts to device-specific communication and computational constraints. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis of FSLoRA that characterizes how the sketching ratios affect the convergence rate. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and LLM models, we demonstrate FSLoRA's superior performance compared to various baselines.|Wenzhi Fang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19389)|null|

SELMA is designed to handle three primary and two auxiliary tasks related to interactions with virtual assistants simultaneously within a single end-to-end model. We employ low-rank adaptation modules for parameter-efficient training of both the audio encoder and the LLM. Additionally, we implement a feature pooling strategy enabling the system to recognize global patterns and improve accuracy on tasks less reliant on individual sequence elements. Experimental results on Voice Trigger (VT) detection, Device-Directed Speech Detection (DDSD), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), demonstrate that our approach both simplifies the typical input processing pipeline of virtual assistants significantly and also improves performance compared to dedicated models for each individual task. SELMA yields relative Equal-Error Rate improvements of 64% on the VT detection task, and 22% on DDSD, while also achieving word error rates close to the baseline.|Dominik Wagner et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19377)|null|
|**2025-01-31**|**We're Different, We're the Same: Creative Homogeneity Across LLMs**|Numerous powerful large language models (LLMs) are now available for use as writing support tools, idea generators, and beyond. Although these LLMs are marketed as helpful creative assistants, several works have shown that using an LLM as a creative partner results in a narrower set of creative outputs. However, these studies only consider the effects of interacting with a single LLM, begging the question of whether such narrowed creativity stems from using a particular LLM -- which arguably has a limited range of outputs -- or from using LLMs in general as creative assistants. To study this question, we elicit creative responses from humans and a broad set of LLMs using standardized creativity tests and compare the population-level diversity of responses. We find that LLM responses are much more similar to other LLM responses than human responses are to each other, even after controlling for response structure and other key variables. This finding of significant homogeneity in creative outputs across the LLMs we evaluate adds a new dimension to the ongoing conversation about creativity and LLMs. If today's LLMs behave similarly, using them as a creative partners -- regardless of the model used -- may drive all users towards a limited set of "creative" outputs.|Emily Wenger et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19361)|null|

The meninges are often oversimplified in current finite element (FE) head models due to their complex anatomy and spatially-variant mechanical behavior. This study performed a systematic review (SR) on the mechanical properties of each individual layer of the meninges to obtain benchmark data for FE modeling and to identify gaps in the current literature. Relevant studies were filtered through three stages: a broad initial search filter, a large language model classifier, and manual verification by a human reviewer. Out of over 25,000 studies initially considered, this review ultimately included 47 studies on the dura mater, 8 on the arachnoid mater, and 7 on the pia mater, representing the largest and most comprehensive SR on the mechanical properties of the meninges. Each layer was found to exhibit nonlinear rate dependence that varies with species, age, location, and orientation. This study revealed that the elastic modulus of pia mater most often used in simplified linear elastic FE models is likely underestimated by an order of magnitude and fails to consider directional dependence. Future studies investigating the mechanical properties of the meninges should focus on a wider range of loading rates as well as age effects for the arachnoid mater and pia mater, as these features are relatively understudied and expected to affect the fidelity of FE predictions.|Brandon P.

|**2025-01-31**|**The Energy Loss Phenomenon in RLHF: A New Perspective on Mitigating Reward Hacking**|This work identifies the Energy Loss Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its connection to reward hacking. Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of \texttt{EPPO} in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.|Yuchun Miao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19358)|null|

However, the mechanisms underlying this homogeneity bias remain relatively unexplored. We propose that this bias emerges from systematic differences in the probability distributions from which tokens are sampled at inference-time. Analyzing three measures of uncertainty in token sampling distributions-entropy, perplexity, and probability of differentiation-we find that in some models, specifically GPT-4 Turbo and Llama-3.2, tokens are sampled more deterministically when generating texts about marginalized groups (i.e., Black Americans and women) compared to their dominant group counterparts (i.e., White Americans and men). While these findings may help explain homogeneity bias in certain models, the patterns did not replicate across all VLMs tested, suggesting multiple mechanisms may contribute to homogeneity bias in AI.|Messi H.

For training, we adopt the progressing module replacement method and show that the lightweight training of the low-rank modules with approximately 30M-40M tokens is sufficient to achieve performance on par with LLMs of comparable sizes trained from scratch. We release the resultant models, DeltaLLAMA and DeltaPHI, with a 12% parameter reduction, retaining 90% of the performance of the base Llama and Phi models on common knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. Our method also outperforms compression techniques JointDrop, LaCo, ShortGPT and SliceGPT with the same number of parameters removed. For example, DeltaPhi 2.9B with a 24% reduction achieves similar average zero-shot accuracies as recovery fine-tuned SlicedPhi 3.3B with a 12% reduction, despite being approximately 400M parameters smaller with no fine-tuning applied.

While humans naturally comprehend the intricate relationships between objects and variations through a multisensory system, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have yet to fully replicate this capacity. To bridge this gap, it becomes essential to incorporate multiple modalities. Models that can seamlessly integrate and reason across these modalities are known as foundation models (FMs). The development of FMs for 2D modalities, such as images and text, has seen significant progress, driven by the abundant availability of large-scale datasets. However, the 3D domain has lagged due to the scarcity of labelled data and high computational overheads. In response, recent research has begun to explore the potential of applying FMs to 3D tasks, overcoming these challenges by leveraging existing 2D knowledge. Additionally, language, with its capacity for abstract reasoning and description of the environment, offers a promising avenue for enhancing 3D understanding through large pre-trained language models (LLMs). Despite the rapid development and adoption of FMs for 3D vision tasks in recent years, there remains a gap in comprehensive and in-depth literature reviews. This article aims to address this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art methods that utilize FMs for 3D visual understanding. We start by reviewing various strategies employed in the building of various 3D FMs. Then we categorize and summarize use of different FMs for tasks such as perception tasks.

However, we identify a phenomenon we term underthinking, where o1-like LLMs frequently switch between different reasoning thoughts without sufficiently exploring promising paths to reach a correct solution. This behavior leads to inadequate depth of reasoning and decreased performance, particularly on challenging mathematical problems. To systematically analyze this issue, we conduct experiments on three challenging test sets and two representative open-source o1-like models, revealing that frequent thought switching correlates with incorrect responses. We introduce a novel metric to quantify underthinking by measuring token efficiency in incorrect answers. To address underthinking, we propose a decoding strategy with thought switching penalty TIP that discourages premature transitions between thoughts, encouraging deeper exploration of each reasoning path. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves accuracy across challenging datasets without requiring model fine-tuning.

Unlike prior work, this research removes time limitations to explore whether DeepSeek R1's architecture, known for its reliance on token-based reasoning, can achieve accurate solutions through a multi-step process.

Results demonstrate that DeepSeek R1 achieves superior accuracy on these complex problems but generates significantly more tokens than other models, confirming its token-intensive approach. The findings highlight a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in mathematical problem-solving with large language models: while DeepSeek R1 excels in accuracy, its reliance on extensive token generation may not be optimal for applications requiring rapid responses.

However, AI-powered bots have increasingly been able to bypass most existing CAPTCHA systems, posing significant security threats to web applications. This makes the design of new CAPTCHA mechanisms an urgent priority. We observe that humans are highly sensitive to shifts and abrupt changes in videos, while current AI systems still struggle to comprehend and respond to such situations effectively. Based on this observation, we design and implement BounTCHA, a CAPTCHA mechanism that leverages human perception of boundaries in video transitions and disruptions. By utilizing AI's capability to expand original videos with prompts, we introduce unexpected twists and changes to create a pipeline for generating short videos for CAPTCHA purposes. We develop a prototype and conduct experiments to collect data on humans' time biases in boundary identification. This data serves as a basis for distinguishing between human users and bots.

Participants also delved into the multifaceted applications of LLMs, including legal aspects of creative content production, humans in the loop, decentralised approaches to multimodal generative AI models, nanopublications and AI for personal scientific knowledge graphs, commonsense knowledge in automatic story and narrative completion, generative AI for art critique, prompt engineering, automatic music composition, commonsense prototyping and conceptual blending, and elicitation of tacit knowledge. As Large Language Models and semantic technologies continue to evolve, new exciting prospects are emerging: a future where the boundaries between creative expression and factual knowledge become increasingly permeable and porous, leading to a world of knowledge that is both informative and inspiring.|Raia Abu Ahmad et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18542)|null|
|**2025-01-30**|**Can we Retrieve Everything All at Once? ARM: An Alignment-Oriented LLM-based Retrieval Method**|Real-world open-domain questions can be complicated, particularly when answering them involves information from multiple information sources. LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in decomposing complex tasks into simpler steps, and previous work has used it for better retrieval in support of complex questions. However, LLM's decomposition of questions is unaware of what data is available and how data is organized, often leading to a sub-optimal retrieval performance. Recent effort in agentic RAG proposes to perform retrieval in an iterative fashion, where a followup query is derived as an action based on previous rounds of retrieval. While this provides one way of interacting with the data collection, agentic RAG's exploration of data is inefficient because successive queries depend on previous results rather than being guided by the organization of available data in the collection. To address this problem, we propose an LLM-based retrieval method -- ARM, that aims to better align the question with the organization of the data collection by exploring relationships among data objects beyond matching the utterance of the query, thus leading to a retrieve-all-at-once solution for complex queries. We evaluated ARM on two datasets, Bird and OTT-QA. On Bird, it outperforms standard RAG with query decomposition by up to 5.2 pt in execution accuracy and agentic RAG (ReAct) by up to 15.9 pt. On OTT-QA, it achieves up to 5.5 pt and 19.3 pt higher F1 match scores compared to these approaches.|Peter Baile Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18539)|null|
|**2025-01-30**|**Illusions of Relevance: Using Content Injection Attacks to Deceive Retrievers, Rerankers, and LLM Judges**|Consider a scenario in which a user searches for information, only to encounter texts flooded with misleading or non-relevant content. This scenario exemplifies a simple yet potent vulnerability in neural Information Retrieval (IR) pipelines: content injection attacks. We find that embedding models for retrieval, rerankers, and large language model (LLM) relevance judges are vulnerable to these attacks, in which adversaries insert misleading text into passages to manipulate model judgements. We identify two primary threats: (1) inserting unrelated or harmful content within passages that still appear deceptively "relevant", and (2) inserting entire queries or key query terms into passages to boost their perceived relevance. While the second tactic has been explored in prior research, we present, to our knowledge, the first empirical analysis of the first threat, demonstrating how state-of-the-art models can be easily misled. Our study systematically examines the factors that influence an attack's success, such as the placement of injected content and the balance between relevant and non-relevant material. Additionally, we explore various defense strategies, including adversarial passage classifiers, retriever fine-tuning to discount manipulated content, and prompting LLM judges to adopt a more cautious approach. However, we find that these countermeasures often involve trade-offs, sacrificing effectiveness for attack robustness and sometimes penalizing legitimate documents in the process. Our findings highlight the need for stronger defenses against these evolving adversarial strategies to maintain the trustworthiness of IR systems. We release our code and scripts to facilitate further research.|Manveer Singh Tamber et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18536)|**[link](https://github.com/manveertamber/content_injection_attacks)**|
|**2025-01-30**|**Differentially Private Steering for Large Language Model Alignment**|Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and away from undesirable behaviors (such as hallucination) has become increasingly important. Recently, steering LLMs towards a desired behavior via activation editing has emerged as an effective method to mitigate harmful generations at inference-time. Activation editing modifies LLM representations by preserving information from positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) and minimising information from negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinations). When these demonstrations come from a private dataset, the aligned LLM may leak private information contained in those private samples. In this work, we present the first study of aligning LLM behavior with private datasets. Our work proposes the \textit{\underline{P}rivate \underline{S}teering for LLM \underline{A}lignment (PSA)} algorithm to edit LLM activations with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. We conduct extensive experiments on seven different benchmarks with open-source LLMs of different sizes (0.5B to 7B) and model families (LlaMa, Qwen, Mistral and Gemma). Our results show that PSA achieves DP guarantees for LLM alignment with minimal loss in performance, including alignment metrics, open-ended text generation quality, and general-purpose reasoning. We also develop the first Membership Inference Attack (MIA) for evaluating and auditing the empirical privacy for the problem of LLM steering via activation editing. Our attack is tailored for activation editing and relies solely on the generated texts without their associated probabilities. Our experiments support the theoretical guarantees by showing improved guarantees for our \textit{PSA} algorithm compared to several existing non-private techniques.|Anmol Goel et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18532)|**[link](https://github.com/ukplab/iclr2025-psa)**|
|**2025-01-30**|**Learn from the Past: Language-conditioned Object Rearrangement with Large Language Models**|Object rearrangement is a significant task for collaborative robots, where they are directed to manipulate objects into a specified goal state. Determining the placement of objects is a major challenge that influences the efficiency of the rearrangement process. Most current methods heavily rely on pre-collected datasets to train the model for predicting the goal position and are restricted to specific instructions, which limits their broader applicability and effectiveness.In this paper, we propose a framework of language-conditioned object rearrangement based on the Large Language Model (LLM). Particularly, our approach mimics human reasoning by using past successful experiences as a reference to infer the desired goal position. Based on LLM's strong natural language comprehension and inference ability, our method can generalise to handle various everyday objects and free-form language instructions in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods can effectively execute the robotic rearrangement tasks, even those involving long sequential orders.|Guanqun Cao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18516)|null|
|**2025-01-29**|**Dialogue is Better Than Monologue: Instructing Medical LLMs via Strategical Conversations**|Current medical AI systems often fail to replicate real-world clinical reasoning, as they are predominantly trained and evaluated on static text and question-answer tasks. These tuning methods and benchmarks overlook critical aspects like evidence-based reasoning and handling distracting information. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark that simulates real-world diagnostic scenarios, integrating noise and difficulty levels aligned with USMLE standards. Moreover, we explore dialogue-based fine-tuning, which transforms static datasets into conversational formats to better capture iterative reasoning processes. Experiments show that dialogue-tuned models outperform traditional methods, with improvements of $9.64\%$ in multi-round reasoning scenarios and $6.18\%$ in accuracy in a noisy environment. Our findings highlight dialogue tuning as a promising approach for advancing clinically aligned and robust medical AI systems.|Zijie Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17860)|null|
|**2025-01-29**|**Improving Your Model Ranking on Chatbot Arena by Vote Rigging**|Chatbot Arena is a popular platform for evaluating LLMs by pairwise battles, where users vote for their preferred response from two randomly sampled anonymous models. While Chatbot Arena is widely regarded as a reliable LLM ranking leaderboard, we show that crowdsourced voting can be rigged to improve (or decrease) the ranking of a target model $m_{t}$. We first introduce a straightforward target-only rigging strategy that focuses on new battles involving $m_{t}$, identifying it via watermarking or a binary classifier, and exclusively voting for $m_{t}$ wins. However, this strategy is practically inefficient because there are over $190$ models on Chatbot Arena and on average only about $1\%$ of new battles will involve $m_{t}$. To overcome this, we propose omnipresent rigging strategies, exploiting the Elo rating mechanism of Chatbot Arena that any new vote on a battle can influence the ranking of the target model $m_{t}$, even if $m_{t}$ is not directly involved in the battle. We conduct experiments on around $1.7$ million historical votes from the Chatbot Arena Notebook, showing that omnipresent rigging strategies can improve model rankings by rigging only hundreds of new votes. While we have evaluated several defense mechanisms, our findings highlight the importance of continued efforts to prevent vote rigging.

|**2025-01-29**|**Learning Beyond the Surface: How Far Can Continual Pre-Training with LoRA Enhance LLMs' Domain-Specific Insight Learning?**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various tasks, yet their ability to extract and internalize deeper insights from domain-specific datasets remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how continual pre-training can enhance LLMs' capacity for insight learning across three distinct forms: declarative, statistical, and probabilistic insights. Focusing on two critical domains: medicine and finance, we employ LoRA to train LLMs on two existing datasets. To evaluate each insight type, we create benchmarks to measure how well continual pre-training helps models go beyond surface-level knowledge. We also assess the impact of document modification on capturing insights. The results show that, while continual pre-training on original documents has a marginal effect, modifying documents to retain only essential information significantly enhances the insight-learning capabilities of LLMs.|Pouya Pezeshkpour et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17840)|**[link](https://github.com/megagonlabs/insight_miner)**|
|**2025-01-29**|**LEKA:LLM-Enhanced Knowledge Augmentation**|Humans excel in analogical learning and knowledge transfer and, more importantly, possess a unique understanding of identifying appropriate sources of knowledge. From a model's perspective, this presents an interesting challenge. If models could autonomously retrieve knowledge useful for transfer or decision-making to solve problems, they would transition from passively acquiring to actively accessing and learning from knowledge. However, filling models with knowledge is relatively straightforward -- it simply requires more training and accessible knowledge bases. The more complex task is teaching models about which knowledge can be analogized and transferred. Therefore, we design a knowledge augmentation method LEKA for knowledge transfer that actively searches for suitable knowledge sources that can enrich the target domain's knowledge. This LEKA method extracts key information from textual information from the target domain, retrieves pertinent data from external data libraries, and harmonizes retrieved data with the target domain data in feature space and marginal probability measures. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments across various domains and demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods in reducing computational costs, automating data alignment, and optimizing transfer learning outcomes.|Xinhao Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17802)|null|

However, exploring the vast space of UI references remains a challenge. Existing AI-based UI search methods often miss crucial semantics like target users or the mood of apps. Additionally, these models typically require metadata like view hierarchies, limiting their practical use. We used a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to extract and interpret semantics from mobile UI images. We identified key UI semantics through a formative study and developed a semantic-based UI search system. Through computational and human evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing UI retrieval methods, offering UI designers a more enriched and contextually relevant search experience. We enhance the understanding of mobile UI design semantics and highlight MLLMs' potential in inspirational search, providing a rich dataset of UI semantics for future studies.|Seokhyeon Park et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17799)|**[link](https://github.com/spark-damian/s-ui)**|

Building upon CosyVoice, we incorporate a $S^{3}$ tokenizer, a large language model (LLM), an optimal-transport conditional flow matching model (OT-CFM), and a grapheme to phoneme prediction model, to generate realistic speech that closely mimics human utterances. Our evaluation demonstrates BreezyVoice's superior performance in both general and code-switching contexts, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in generating high-fidelity speech. Additionally, we address the challenges of generalizability in modeling long-tail speakers and polyphone disambiguation.

Our methods include the Picture Method for LVLMs and the Description Method for LLMs, enabling these models to tackle these challenges. We conduct experiments using prominent models, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, on linguistic puzzles. Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current AI methods in linguistic decipherment, highlighting the impact of Unicode encoding on model performance and the challenges of modeling visual language tokens through descriptions.

We compare different methods of input formatting in order to gauge the model's performance to correctly predict defect regimes on our sparse Baseline dataset and our natural language Prompt dataset. The model displays robust predictive capability, achieving an accuracy of 93\% when asked to provide the defect regimes associated with a set of process parameters.

|**2025-01-29**|**2SSP: A Two-Stage Framework for Structured Pruning of LLMs**|We propose a novel Two-Stage framework for Structured Pruning (2SSP) for pruning Large Language Models (LLMs), which combines two different strategies of pruning, namely Width and Depth Pruning. The first stage (Width Pruning) removes entire neurons, hence their corresponding rows and columns, aiming to preserve the connectivity among the pruned structures in the intermediate state of the Feed-Forward Networks in each Transformer block. This is done based on an importance score measuring the impact of each neuron over the output magnitude. The second stage (Depth Pruning), instead, removes entire Attention submodules. This is done by applying an iterative process that removes the Attention submodules with the minimum impact on a given metric of interest (in our case, perplexity). We also propose a novel mechanism to balance the sparsity rate of the two stages w.r.t. to the desired global sparsity. We test 2SSP on four LLM families and three sparsity rates (25\%, 37.5\%, and 50\%), measuring the resulting perplexity over three language modeling datasets as well as the performance over six downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms five state-of-the-art competitors over three language modeling and six downstream tasks, with an up to two-order-of-magnitude gain in terms of pruning time.

|**2025-01-29**|**Hybrid Graphs for Table-and-Text based Question Answering using LLMs**|Answering questions that require reasoning and aggregation across both structured (tables) and unstructured (raw text) data sources presents significant challenges. Current methods rely on fine-tuning and high-quality, human-curated data, which is difficult to obtain. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results for multi-hop question answering (QA) over single-source text data in a zero-shot setting, yet exploration into multi-source Table-Text QA remains limited. In this paper, we present a novel Hybrid Graph-based approach for Table-Text QA that leverages LLMs without fine-tuning. Our method constructs a unified Hybrid Graph from textual and tabular data, pruning information based on the input question to provide the LLM with relevant context concisely. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Hybrid-QA and OTT-QA datasets using state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA-3. Our method achieves the best zero-shot performance on both datasets, improving Exact Match scores by up to 10% on Hybrid-QA and 5.4% on OTT-QA. Moreover, our approach reduces token usage by up to 53% compared to the original context.|Ankush Agarwal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17767)|null|
|**2025-01-28**|**AxBench: Steering LLMs? Even Simple Baselines Outperform Sparse Autoencoders**|Fine-grained steering of language model outputs is essential for safety and reliability. Prompting and finetuning are widely used to achieve these goals, but interpretability researchers have proposed a variety of representation-based techniques as well, including sparse autoencoders (SAEs), linear artificial tomography, supervised steering vectors, linear probes, and representation finetuning. At present, there is no benchmark for making direct comparisons between these proposals. Therefore, we introduce AxBench, a large-scale benchmark for steering and concept detection, and report experiments on Gemma-2-2B and 9B. For steering, we find that prompting outperforms all existing methods, followed by finetuning. For concept detection, representation-based methods such as difference-in-means, perform the best. On both evaluations, SAEs are not competitive. We introduce a novel weakly-supervised representational method (Rank-1 Representation Finetuning; ReFT-r1), which is competitive on both tasks while providing the interpretability advantages that prompting lacks. Along with AxBench, we train and publicly release SAE-scale feature dictionaries for ReFT-r1 and DiffMean.|Zhengxuan Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17148)|null|
|**2025-01-28**|**FactCG: Enhancing Fact Checkers with Graph-Based Multi-Hop Data**|Prior research on training grounded factuality classification models to detect hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) has relied on public natural language inference (NLI) data and synthetic data. However, conventional NLI datasets are not well-suited for document-level reasoning, which is critical for detecting LLM hallucinations. Recent approaches to document-level synthetic data generation involve iteratively removing sentences from documents and annotating factuality using LLM-based prompts. While effective, this method is computationally expensive for long documents and limited by the LLM's capabilities. In this work, we analyze the differences between existing synthetic training data used in state-of-the-art models and real LLM output claims. Based on our findings, we propose a novel approach for synthetic data generation, CG2C, that leverages multi-hop reasoning on context graphs extracted from documents. Our fact checker model, FactCG, demonstrates improved performance with more connected reasoning, using the same backbone models. Experiments show it even outperforms GPT-4-o on the LLM-Aggrefact benchmark with much smaller model size.|Deren Lei et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17144)|**[link](https://github.com/derenlei/factcg)**|
|**2025-01-28**|**ASTRAL: Automated Safety Testing of Large Language Models**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention due to their ability to understand and generate sophisticated human-like content. However, ensuring their safety is paramount as they might provide harmful and unsafe responses. Existing LLM testing frameworks address various safety-related concerns (e.g., drugs, terrorism, animal abuse) but often face challenges due to unbalanced and obsolete datasets. In this paper, we present ASTRAL, a tool that automates the generation and execution of test cases (i.e., prompts) for testing the safety of LLMs. First, we introduce a novel black-box coverage criterion to generate balanced and diverse unsafe test inputs across a diverse set of safety categories as well as linguistic writing characteristics (i.e., different style and persuasive writing techniques). Second, we propose an LLM-based approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), few-shot prompting strategies and web browsing to generate up-to-date test inputs. Lastly, similar to current LLM test automation techniques, we leverage LLMs as test oracles to distinguish between safe and unsafe test outputs, allowing a fully automated testing approach. We conduct an extensive evaluation on well-known LLMs, revealing the following key findings: i) GPT3.5 outperforms other LLMs when acting as the test oracle, accurately detecting unsafe responses, and even surpassing more recent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), as well as LLMs that are specifically tailored to detect unsafe LLM outputs (e.g., LlamaGuard); ii) the results confirm that our approach can uncover nearly twice as many unsafe LLM behaviors with the same number of test inputs compared to currently used static datasets; and iii) our black-box coverage criterion combined with web browsing can effectively guide the LLM on generating up-to-date unsafe test inputs, significantly increasing the number of unsafe LLM behaviors.|Miriam Ugarte et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17132)|null|

While models are often adapted to user preferences, it is equally important to ensure they align with moral norms and behaviours in real-world social situations. Despite significant progress in languages like English and Chinese, French has seen little attention in this area, leaving a gap in understanding how LLMs handle moral reasoning in this language. To address this gap, we introduce Histoires Morales, a French dataset derived from Moral Stories, created through translation and subsequently refined with the assistance of native speakers to guarantee grammatical accuracy and adaptation to the French cultural context. We also rely on annotations of the moral values within the dataset to ensure their alignment with French norms. Histoires Morales covers a wide range of social situations, including differences in tipping practices, expressions of honesty in relationships, and responsibilities toward animals. To foster future research, we also conduct preliminary experiments on the alignment of multilingual models on French and English data and the robustness of the alignment. We find that while LLMs are generally aligned with human moral norms by default, they can be easily influenced with user-preference optimization for both moral and immoral data.|Thibaud Leteno et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17117)|**[link](https://github.com/upunaprosk/histoires-morales)**|

Quantized training presents a promising solution by enabling low-bit arithmetic operations to reduce these costs. While FP8 precision has demonstrated feasibility, leveraging FP4 remains a challenge due to significant quantization errors and limited representational capacity. This work introduces the first FP4 training framework for LLMs, addressing these challenges with two key innovations: a differentiable quantization estimator for precise weight updates and an outlier clamping and compensation strategy to prevent activation collapse. To ensure stability, the framework integrates a mixed-precision training scheme and vector-wise quantization. Experimental results demonstrate that our FP4 framework achieves accuracy comparable to BF16 and FP8, with minimal degradation, scaling effectively to 13B-parameter LLMs trained on up to 100B tokens.

This study evalu-ates 10 LLMs with 7 to 8 billion parameters using 945 competition-level problems from the MATH dataset. The focus is on their ability to generate executable Python code as a step in their reasoning process, involving over 9,450 code executions. The research introduces an evaluation framework using mistral-large-2411 to rate answers on a 5-point scale, which helps address inconsistencies in mathematical notation. It also examines the impact of regenerating output token-by-token on refining results. The findings reveal a significant 34.5% per-formance gap between the top commercial model (gpt-4o-mini, scoring 83.7%) and the least effective open-source model (open-codestral-mamba:v0.1, scoring 49.2%). This disparity is especially noticeable in complex areas like Number Theory. While token-by-token regeneration slightly improved accuracy (+0.8%) for the model llama3.1:8b, it also reduced code execution time by 36.7%, highlighting a trade-off between efficiency and precision. The study also noted a consistent trend where harder problems correlated with lower accuracy across all models. Despite using controlled execution environments, less than 1% of the generated code was unsafe, and 3.17% of problems remained unsolved after 10 attempts, suggesting that hybrid reasoning methods may be beneficial.|Evgenii Evstafev et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17084)|null|
|**2025-01-28**|**Enhanced Retrieval of Long Documents: Leveraging Fine-Grained Block Representations with Large Language Models**|In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional power in various domains, including information retrieval. Most of the previous practices involve leveraging these models to create a single embedding for each query, each passage, or each document individually, a strategy exemplified and used by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. While this method has proven effective, we argue that it falls short in fully capturing the nuanced intricacies of document-level texts due to its reliance on a relatively coarse-grained representation. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, fine-grained approach aimed at enhancing the accuracy of relevance scoring for long documents. Our methodology firstly segments a long document into blocks, each of which is embedded using an LLM, for matching with the query representation. When calculating the relevance score, we aggregate the query-block relevance scores through a weighted sum method, yielding a comprehensive score for the query with the entire document. Despite its apparent simplicity, our experimental findings reveal that this approach outperforms standard representation methods and achieves a significant reduction in embedding generation latency. Moreover, by carefully optimizing pairwise loss functions, superior performances have been achieved.|Minghan Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17039)|null|

Recent research contributions have proposed approaches -- based on static code analysis and transformation -- to automatically identify and enact refactoring opportunities of non-idiomatic code into idiomatic ones. Given the potential recently offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-related tasks, in this paper, we present the results of a replication study in which we investigate GPT-4 effectiveness in recommending and suggesting idiomatic refactoring actions. Our results reveal that GPT-4 not only identifies idiomatic constructs effectively but frequently exceeds the benchmark in proposing refactoring actions where the existing baseline failed. A manual analysis of a random sample shows the correctness of the obtained recommendations.

|**2025-01-27**|**Evaluating The Performance of Using Large Language Models to Automate Summarization of CT Simulation Orders in Radiation Oncology**|Purpose: This study aims to use a large language model (LLM) to automate the generation of summaries from the CT simulation orders and evaluate its performance.   Materials and Methods: A total of 607 CT simulation orders for patients were collected from the Aria database at our institution. A locally hosted Llama 3.1 405B model, accessed via the Application Programming Interface (API) service, was used to extract keywords from the CT simulation orders and generate summaries. The downloaded CT simulation orders were categorized into seven groups based on treatment modalities and disease sites. For each group, a customized instruction prompt was developed collaboratively with therapists to guide the Llama 3.1 405B model in generating summaries. The ground truth for the corresponding summaries was manually derived by carefully reviewing each CT simulation order and subsequently verified by therapists. The accuracy of the LLM-generated summaries was evaluated by therapists using the verified ground truth as a reference.   Results: About 98% of the LLM-generated summaries aligned with the manually generated ground truth in terms of accuracy. Our evaluations showed an improved consistency in format and enhanced readability of the LLM-generated summaries compared to the corresponding therapists-generated summaries.

|**2025-01-27**|**RAPID: Retrieval-Augmented Parallel Inference Drafting for Text-Based Video Event Retrieval**|Retrieving events from videos using text queries has become increasingly challenging due to the rapid growth of multimedia content. Existing methods for text-based video event retrieval often focus heavily on object-level descriptions, overlooking the crucial role of contextual information. This limitation is especially apparent when queries lack sufficient context, such as missing location details or ambiguous background elements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel system called RAPID (Retrieval-Augmented Parallel Inference Drafting), which leverages advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt-based learning to semantically correct and enrich user queries with relevant contextual information. These enriched queries are then processed through parallel retrieval, followed by an evaluation step to select the most relevant results based on their alignment with the original query. Through extensive experiments on our custom-developed dataset, we demonstrate that RAPID significantly outperforms traditional retrieval methods, particularly for contextually incomplete queries. Our system was validated for both speed and accuracy through participation in the Ho Chi Minh City AI Challenge 2024, where it successfully retrieved events from over 300 hours of video. Further evaluation comparing RAPID with the baseline proposed by the competition organizers demonstrated its superior effectiveness, highlighting the strength and robustness of our approach.|Long Nguyen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16303)|null|

However, they are often prohibitive in reality due to constraints on computation bandwidth. In this work, we propose a \textbf{flexible} architecture called \textbf{Matroyshka Re-Ranker}, which is designed to facilitate \textbf{runtime customization} of model layers and sequence lengths at each layer based on users' configurations. Consequently, the LLM-based re-rankers can be made applicable across various real-world situations. The increased flexibility may come at the cost of precision loss. To address this problem, we introduce a suite of techniques to optimize the performance. First, we propose \textbf{cascaded self-distillation}, where each sub-architecture learns to preserve a precise re-ranking performance from its super components, whose predictions can be exploited as smooth and informative teacher signals. Second, we design a \textbf{factorized compensation mechanism}, where two collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation modules, vertical and horizontal, are jointly employed to compensate for the precision loss resulted from arbitrary combinations of layer and sequence compression. We perform comprehensive experiments based on the passage and document retrieval datasets from MSMARCO, along with all public datasets from BEIR benchmark. In our experiments, Matryoshka Re-Ranker substantially outperforms the existing methods, while effectively preserving its superior performance across various forms of compression and different application scenarios.|Zheng Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16302)|null|
|**2025-01-27**|**Large Models in Dialogue for Active Perception and Anomaly Detection**|Autonomous aerial monitoring is an important task aimed at gathering information from areas that may not be easily accessible by humans. At the same time, this task often requires recognizing anomalies from a significant distance or not previously encountered in the past. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages the advanced capabilities provided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively collect information and perform anomaly detection in novel scenes. To this end, we propose an LLM based model dialogue approach, in which two deep learning models engage in a dialogue to actively control a drone to increase perception and anomaly detection accuracy. We conduct our experiments in a high fidelity simulation environment where an LLM is provided with a predetermined set of natural language movement commands mapped into executable code functions. Additionally, we deploy a multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA) model charged with the task of visual question answering and captioning. By engaging the two models in conversation, the LLM asks exploratory questions while simultaneously flying a drone into different parts of the scene, providing a novel way to implement active perception. By leveraging LLMs reasoning ability, we output an improved detailed description of the scene going beyond existing static perception approaches. In addition to information gathering, our approach is utilized for anomaly detection and our results demonstrate the proposed methods effectiveness in informing and alerting about potential hazards.|Tzoulio Chamiti et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16300)|null|
|**2025-01-27**|**FALCON: Resolving Visual Redundancy and Fragmentation in High-resolution Multimodal Large Language Models via Visual Registers**|The incorporation of high-resolution visual input equips multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with enhanced visual perception capabilities for real-world tasks. However, most existing high-resolution MLLMs rely on a cropping-based approach to process images, which leads to fragmented visual encoding and a sharp increase in redundant tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose the FALCON model. FALCON introduces a novel visual register technique to simultaneously: 1) Eliminate redundant tokens at the stage of visual encoding. To directly address the visual redundancy present in the output of vision encoder, we propose a Register-based Representation Compacting (ReCompact) mechanism. This mechanism introduces a set of learnable visual registers designed to adaptively aggregate essential information while discarding redundancy. It enables the encoder to produce a more compact visual representation with a minimal number of output tokens, thus eliminating the need for an additional compression module. 2) Ensure continuity in visual encoding. To address the potential encoding errors caused by fragmented visual inputs, we develop a Register Interactive Attention (ReAtten) module. This module facilitates effective and efficient information exchange across sub-images by enabling interactions between visual registers. It ensures the continuity of visual semantics throughout the encoding. We conduct comprehensive experiments with FALCON on high-resolution benchmarks across a wide range of scenarios. FALCON demonstrates superior performance with a remarkable 9-fold and 16-fold reduction in visual tokens.|Renshan Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16297)|null|

Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising approach to interpreting medical images with the support of text descriptions. However, previous research has primarily focused on 2D medical images, leaving richer spatial information of 3D images under-explored, and single-modality-based methods are limited by overlooking the critical clinical information contained in other modalities. To address this issue, this paper proposes Brain-Adapter, a novel approach that incorporates an extra bottleneck layer to learn new knowledge and instill it into the original pre-trained knowledge. The major idea is to incorporate a lightweight bottleneck layer to train fewer parameters while capturing essential information and utilize a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) strategy to align multimodal data within a unified representation space. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in integrating multimodal data to significantly improve the diagnosis accuracy without high computational costs, highlighting the potential to enhance real-world diagnostic workflows.|Jing Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16282)|null|
|**2025-01-27**|**Do LLMs Have Visualization Literacy? An Evaluation on Modified Visualizations to Test Generalization in Data Interpretation**|In this paper, we assess the visualization literacy of two prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT), the backend of ChatGPT, and Google's Gemini, previously known as Bard, to establish benchmarks for assessing their visualization capabilities. While LLMs have shown promise in generating chart descriptions, captions, and design suggestions, their potential for evaluating visualizations remains under-explored. Collecting data from humans for evaluations has been a bottleneck for visualization research in terms of both time and money, and if LLMs were able to serve, even in some limited role, as evaluators, they could be a significant resource. To investigate the feasibility of using LLMs in the visualization evaluation process, we explore the extent to which LLMs possess visualization literacy -- a crucial factor for their effective utility in the field. We conducted a series of experiments using a modified 53-item Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) for GPT-4 and Gemini. Our findings indicate that the LLMs we explored currently fail to achieve the same levels of visualization literacy when compared to data from the general public reported in VLAT, and LLMs heavily relied on their pre-existing knowledge to answer questions instead of utilizing the information provided by the visualization when answering questions.|Jiayi Hong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16277)|null|

Concepts such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other advanced techniques have been developed to enhance these systems by integrating specific university data, enabling LLMs to provide informed responses on admissions and academic counseling. However, these enhanced RAG techniques often involve high operational costs and require the training of complex, specialized modules, which poses challenges for practical deployment. Additionally, in the educational context, it is crucial to provide accurate answers to prevent misinformation, a task that LLM-based systems find challenging without appropriate strategies and methods. In this paper, we introduce the Unified RAG (URAG) Framework, a hybrid approach that significantly improves the accuracy of responses, particularly for critical queries. Experimental results demonstrate that URAG enhances our in-house, lightweight model to perform comparably to state-of-the-art commercial models. Moreover, to validate its practical applicability, we conducted a case study at our educational institution, which received positive feedback and acclaim. This study not only proves the effectiveness of URAG but also highlights its feasibility for real-world implementation in educational settings.|Long Nguyen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16276)|null|
|**2025-01-27**|**Return of the Encoder: Maximizing Parameter Efficiency for SLMs**|The dominance of large decoder-only language models has overshadowed encoder-decoder architectures, despite their fundamental efficiency advantages in sequence processing. For small language models (SLMs) - those with 1 billion parameters or fewer - our systematic analysis across GPU, CPU, and NPU platforms reveals that encoder-decoder architectures achieve 47% lower first-token latency and 4.7x higher throughput compared to decoder-only models on edge devices. These gains may be attributed to encoder-decoder's one-time input processing and efficient separation of understanding and generation phases.   We introduce a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables encoder-decoder models to leverage capabilities from large scalable decoder-only teachers while preserving their architectural advantages, achieving up to 6 average performance points improvement across diverse tasks, with significant gains in asymmetric sequence tasks where input and output distributions can benefit from different processing approaches.   When combined with modern advances like Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) and Vision encoders, our systematic investigation demonstrates that encoder-decoder architectures provide a more practical path toward deploying capable language models in resource-constrained environments. Our findings challenge the prevailing trend toward decoder-only scaling, showing that architectural choices become increasingly crucial as parameter budgets decrease, particularly for on-device and edge deployments where computational efficiency is paramount.|Mohamed Elfeki et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16273)|null|

However, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) models for medical literature mining has been limited by insufficient training and evaluation across broad therapeutic areas and diverse tasks. Here, we present LEADS, an AI foundation model for study search, screening, and data extraction from medical literature. The model is trained on 633,759 instruction data points in LEADSInstruct, curated from 21,335 systematic reviews, 453,625 clinical trial publications, and 27,015 clinical trial registries. We showed that LEADS demonstrates consistent improvements over four cutting-edge generic large language models (LLMs) on six tasks. Furthermore, LEADS enhances expert workflows by providing supportive references following expert requests, streamlining processes while maintaining high-quality results. A study with 16 clinicians and medical researchers from 14 different institutions revealed that experts collaborating with LEADS achieved a recall of 0.81 compared to 0.77 experts working alone in study selection, with a time savings of 22.6%. In data extraction tasks, experts using LEADS achieved an accuracy of 0.85 versus 0.80 without using LEADS, alongside a 26.9% time savings. These findings highlight the potential of specialized medical literature foundation models to outperform generic models, delivering significant quality and efficiency benefits when integrated into expert workflows for medical literature mining.|Zifeng Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16255)|null|

However, existing DWMs are limited to scene generation and fail to incorporate scene understanding, which involves interpreting and reasoning about the driving environment. In this paper, we present a unified Driving World Model named HERMES. We seamlessly integrate 3D scene understanding and future scene evolution (generation) through a unified framework in driving scenarios. Specifically, HERMES leverages a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation to consolidate multi-view spatial information while preserving geometric relationships and interactions. We also introduce world queries, which incorporate world knowledge into BEV features via causal attention in the Large Language Model (LLM), enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. We conduct comprehensive studies on nuScenes and OmniDrive-nuScenes datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method. HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing generation error by 32.4% and improving understanding metrics such as CIDEr by 8.0%.

However, test-time compute can be scaled in a variety of ways, and effectively combining different approaches remains an active area of research. Here, we explore this problem in the context of solving real-world GitHub issues from the SWE-bench dataset. Our system, named CodeMonkeys, allows models to iteratively edit a codebase by jointly generating and running a testing script alongside their draft edit. We sample many of these multi-turn trajectories for every issue to generate a collection of candidate edits. This approach lets us scale "serial" test-time compute by increasing the number of iterations per trajectory and "parallel" test-time compute by increasing the number of trajectories per problem. With parallel scaling, we can amortize up-front costs across multiple downstream samples, allowing us to identify relevant codebase context using the simple method of letting an LLM read every file. In order to select between candidate edits, we combine voting using model-generated tests with a final multi-turn trajectory dedicated to selection. Overall, CodeMonkeys resolves 57.4% of issues from SWE-bench Verified using a budget of approximately 2300 USD. Our selection method can also be used to combine candidates from different sources. Selecting over an ensemble of edits from existing top SWE-bench Verified submissions obtains a score of 66.2% and outperforms the best member of the ensemble on its own.

Our replication achieves performance on par with or surpassing existing table LLMs, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on Hitab, a table question-answering dataset. More importantly, through systematic out-of-domain evaluation, we decouple the contributions of training data and the base model, providing insight into their individual impacts.

We present a method to prune LLMs that selectively prunes model blocks based on an importance score and replaces them with a low-parameter replacement strategy. Specifically, we propose a principled metric to replace each pruned block using a weight-sharing mechanism that leverages unpruned counterparts from the model and block-specific low-rank adapters. Furthermore, we facilitate the learning of these replacement blocks with output feature normalization and an adapter initialization scheme built on low-rank SVD reconstructions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial performance gains over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 5/6 benchmarks for a compression rate of 30% and 6/6 benchmarks for a compression rate of 40%. We also demonstrate that our approach can extend smaller models, boosting performance on 6/6 benchmarks using only ~0.3% tokens of extended training with minimal additional parameter costs.|James Seale Smith et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14713)|null|

However, existing research has overlooked the impact of hyperparameter choices and lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the out-of-domain table understanding ability and the general capabilities of these table LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate these abilities in existing table LLMs, and reveal significant declines in both out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities compared to their base models. Through systematic analysis, we show that hyperparameters, such as learning rate, can significantly influence both table-specific and general capabilities. Contrary to the existing table instruction-tuning works, we demonstrate that smaller learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while preserving general capabilities. Based on our findings, we introduce TAMA, a TAble LLM instruction-tuned from LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, which achieves performance on par with, or surpassing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on table tasks, while maintaining strong out-of-domain generalization and general capabilities.

Food-safety regulations, like those in many legal domains, have largely been articulated in a technology-independent manner to ensure their longevity and broad applicability. However, this approach leaves a gap between the regulations and the modern systems and software increasingly used to implement them. In this article, we pursue two main goals. First, we conduct a Grounded Theory study of food-safety regulations and develop a conceptual characterization of food-safety concepts that closely relate to systems and software requirements. Second, we examine the effectiveness of two families of large language models (LLMs) -- BERT and GPT -- in automatically classifying legal provisions based on requirements-related food-safety concepts. Our results show that: (a) when fine-tuned, the accuracy differences between the best-performing models in the BERT and GPT families are relatively small. Nevertheless, the most powerful model in our experiments, GPT-4o, still achieves the highest accuracy, with an average Precision of 89% and an average Recall of 87%; (b) few-shot learning with GPT-4o increases Recall to 97% but decreases Precision to 65%, suggesting a trade-off between fine-tuning and few-shot learning; (c) despite our training examples being drawn exclusively from Canadian regulations, LLM-based classification performs consistently well on test provisions from the US, indicating a degree of generalizability across regulatory jurisdictions; and (d) for our classification task, LLMs significantly outperform simpler baselines constructed using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and automatic keyword extraction.|Shabnam Hassani et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14683)|null|
|**2025-01-24**|**Diffusion based Text-to-Music Generationwith Global and Local Text based Conditioning**|Diffusion based Text-To-Music (TTM) models generate music corresponding to text descriptions. Typically UNet based diffusion models condition on text embeddings generated from a pre-trained large language model or from a cross-modality audio-language representation model. This work proposes a diffusion based TTM, in which the UNet is conditioned on both (i) a uni-modal language model (e.g., T5) via cross-attention and (ii) a cross-modal audio-language representation model (e.g., CLAP) via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). The diffusion model is trained to exploit both a local text representation from the T5 and a global representation from the CLAP. Furthermore, we propose modifications that extract both global and local representations from the T5 through pooling mechanisms that we call mean pooling and self-attention pooling. This approach mitigates the need for an additional encoder (e.g., CLAP) to extract a global representation, thereby reducing the number of model parameters. Our results show that incorporating the CLAP global embeddings to the T5 local embeddings enhances text adherence (KL=1.47) compared to a baseline model solely relying on the T5 local embeddings (KL=1.54). Alternatively, extracting global text embeddings directly from the T5 local embeddings through the proposed mean pooling approach yields superior generation quality (FAD=1.89) while exhibiting marginally inferior text adherence (KL=1.51) against the model conditioned on both CLAP and T5 text embeddings (FAD=1.94 and KL=1.47).

These agents can leverage their planning and tool utilization capabilities to address tasks specified at a high level. However, a standardized dataset to benchmark the agent capabilities of LLMs in medical applications is currently lacking, making the evaluation of LLMs on complex tasks in interactive healthcare environments challenging. To address this gap, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed to assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical records contexts.

MedAgentBench presents an unsaturated agent-oriented benchmark that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit some ability to succeed at. The best model (GPT-4o) achieves a success rate of 72%. However, there is still substantial space for improvement to give the community a next direction to optimize. Furthermore, there is significant variation in performance across task categories.

Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed approach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language models with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI systems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization, generalization, and privacy remains a significant challenge. Over-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while stringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both personalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by leveraging a low-rank adaptation scheme to capture generalization while maintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization. To ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local differential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and global differential privacy to the global prompt. Our approach mitigates the impact of privacy noise on the model performance while balancing the tradeoff between personalization and generalization.

However, their potential for understanding other types of sounds, particularly biomedical sounds, remains largely underexplored despite significant scientific interest. In this study, we focus on diagnosing cardiovascular diseases using phonocardiograms, i.e., heart sounds. Most existing deep neural network (DNN) paradigms are restricted to heart murmur classification (healthy vs unhealthy) and do not predict other acoustic features of the murmur such as timing, grading, harshness, pitch, and quality, which are important in helping physicians diagnose the underlying heart conditions. We propose to finetune an audio LLM, Qwen2-Audio, on the PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset and evaluate its performance in classifying 11 expert-labeled murmur features. Additionally, we aim to achieve more noise-robust and generalizable system by exploring a preprocessing segmentation algorithm using an audio representation model, SSAMBA. Our results indicate that the LLM-based model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 8 of the 11 features and performs comparably in the remaining 3. Moreover, the LLM successfully classifies long-tail murmur features with limited training data, a task that all previous methods have failed to classify.

To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models have been developed, enabling generative models to incorporate relevant document fragments into their inputs. In this paper, we design and evaluate a RAG-based virtual assistant specifically tailored for the University of S\~ao Paulo. Our system architecture comprises two key modules: a retriever and a generative model. We experiment with different types of models for both components, adjusting hyperparameters such as chunk size and the number of retrieved documents. Our optimal retriever model achieves a Top-5 accuracy of 30%, while our most effective generative model scores 22.04\% against ground truth answers. Notably, when the correct document chunks are supplied to the LLMs, accuracy significantly improves to 54.02%, an increase of over 30 percentage points. Conversely, without contextual input, performance declines to 13.68%. These findings highlight the critical role of database access in enhancing LLM performance. They also reveal the limitations of current semantic search methods in accurately identifying relevant documents and underscore the ongoing challenges LLMs face in generating precise responses.|Gustavo Kuratomi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13880)|null|
|**2025-01-23**|**On the Reasoning Capacity of AI Models and How to Quantify It**|Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have intensified the debate surrounding the fundamental nature of their reasoning capabilities. While achieving high performance on benchmarks such as GPQA and MMLU, these models exhibit limitations in more complex reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation methodologies. We propose a novel phenomenological approach that goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics to probe the underlying mechanisms of model behavior, establishing a framework that could broadly impact how we analyze and understand AI systems. Using positional bias in multiple-choice reasoning tasks as a case study, we demonstrate how systematic perturbations can reveal fundamental aspects of model decision-making. To analyze these behaviors, we develop two complementary phenomenological models: a Probabilistic Mixture Model (PMM) that decomposes model responses into reasoning, memorization, and guessing components and an Information-Theoretic Consistency (ITC) analysis that quantifies the relationship between model confidence and strategy selection. Through controlled experiments on reasoning benchmarks, we show that true reasoning remains challenging for current models, with apparent success often relying on sophisticated combinations of memorization and pattern matching rather than genuine logical deduction. More fundamentally, we demonstrate that accuracy alone often overstates a model's reasoning abilities, as model behavior can be characterized through underlying mechanisms in the phase space of cognitive strategies, revealing how models dynamically balance different approaches when responding to queries. This framework enables quantitative criteria for real-world deployments, allowing applications to specify reliability thresholds based on strategy distributions rather than aggregate performance metrics.|Santosh Kumar Radha et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13833)|null|
|**2025-01-23**|**Predicting Compact Phrasal Rewrites with Large Language Models for ASR Post Editing**|Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at rewriting tasks such as text style transfer and grammatical error correction. While there is considerable overlap between the inputs and outputs in these tasks, the decoding cost still increases with output length, regardless of the amount of overlap. By leveraging the overlap between the input and the output, Kaneko and Okazaki (2023) proposed model-agnostic edit span representations to compress the rewrites to save computation. They reported an output length reduction rate of nearly 80% with minimal accuracy impact in four rewriting tasks. In this paper, we propose alternative edit phrase representations inspired by phrase-based statistical machine translation. We systematically compare our phrasal representations with their span representations. We apply the LLM rewriting model to the task of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) post editing and show that our target-phrase-only edit representation has the best efficiency-accuracy trade-off. On the LibriSpeech test set, our method closes 50-60% of the WER gap between the edit span model and the full rewrite model while losing only 10-20% of the length reduction rate of the edit span model.|Hao Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13831)|null|
|**2025-01-23**|**Hallucinations Can Improve Large Language Models in Drug Discovery**|Concerns about hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been raised by researchers, yet their potential in areas where creativity is vital, such as drug discovery, merits exploration. In this paper, we come up with the hypothesis that hallucinations can improve LLMs in drug discovery. To verify this hypothesis, we use LLMs to describe the SMILES string of molecules in natural language and then incorporate these descriptions as part of the prompt to address specific tasks in drug discovery. Evaluated on seven LLMs and five classification tasks, our findings confirm the hypothesis: LLMs can achieve better performance with text containing hallucinations. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B achieves an 18.35% gain in ROC-AUC compared to the baseline without hallucination. Furthermore, hallucinations generated by GPT-4o provide the most consistent improvements across models. Additionally, we conduct empirical analyses and a case study to investigate key factors affecting performance and the underlying reasons. Our research sheds light on the potential use of hallucinations for LLMs and offers new perspectives for future research leveraging LLMs in drug discovery.|Shuzhou Yuan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13824)|null|
|**2025-01-22**|**VideoLLaMA 3: Frontier Multimodal Foundation Models for Image and Video Understanding**|In this paper, we propose VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced multimodal foundation model for image and video understanding. The core design philosophy of VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of "vision-centric" is two-fold: the vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key insight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text data is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing massive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and high-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1) vision-centric alignment stage, which warms up the vision encoder and projector; 2) vision-language pretraining stage, which jointly tunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data covering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as text-only data. 3) multi-task fine-tuning stage, which incorporates image-text SFT data for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for video understanding. 4) video-centric fine-tuning, which further improves the model's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to better capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is adapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding numbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the number of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the representation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from vision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both image and video understanding benchmarks.|Boqiang Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13106)|**[link](https://github.com/damo-nlp-sg/videollama3)**|

It is paramount to ensure the security and reliability of these products by mitigating their vulnerabilities towards malicious user interactions, which can lead to the exposure of great risks and reputational repercussions. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the efficacy of fine-tuning and aligning Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses of different LLMs that serve as input moderation guardrails. We systematically explore various tuning methods by leveraging a small set of training data to adapt these models as proxy defense mechanisms to detect malicious inputs and provide a reasoning for their verdicts, thereby preventing the exploitation of conversational agents. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy and robustness of different tuning strategies to generalize across diverse adversarial and malicious query types. Our experimental results outline the potential of alignment processes tailored to a varied range of harmful input queries, even with constrained data resources. These techniques significantly enhance the safety of conversational AI systems and provide a feasible framework for deploying more secure and trustworthy AI-driven interactions.|Melissa Kazemi Rad et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13080)|null|
|**2025-01-22**|**Does Table Source Matter? Benchmarking and Improving Multimodal Scientific Table Understanding and Reasoning**|Recent large language models (LLMs) have advanced table understanding capabilities but rely on converting tables into text sequences. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable direct visual processing, they face limitations in handling scientific tables due to fixed input image resolutions and insufficient numerical reasoning capabilities. We present a comprehensive framework for multimodal scientific table understanding and reasoning with dynamic input image resolutions. Our framework consists of three key components: (1) MMSci-Pre, a domain-specific table structure learning dataset of 52K scientific table structure recognition samples, (2) MMSci-Ins, an instruction tuning dataset with 12K samples across three table-based tasks, and (3) MMSci-Eval, a benchmark with 3,114 testing samples specifically designed to evaluate numerical reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our domain-specific approach with 52K scientific table images achieves superior performance compared to 150K general-domain tables, highlighting the importance of data quality over quantity. Our proposed table-based MLLMs with dynamic input resolutions show significant improvements in both general table understanding and numerical reasoning capabilities, with strong generalisation to held-out datasets.

We propose a training method which avoids agents learning undesired multi-step plans that receive high reward (multi-step "reward hacks") even if humans are not able to detect that the behaviour is undesired. The method, Myopic Optimization with Non-myopic Approval (MONA), works by combining short-sighted optimization with far-sighted reward. We demonstrate that MONA can prevent multi-step reward hacking that ordinary RL causes, even without being able to detect the reward hacking and without any extra information that ordinary RL does not get access to. We study MONA empirically in three settings which model different misalignment failure modes including 2-step environments with LLMs representing delegated oversight and encoded reasoning and longer-horizon gridworld environments representing sensor tampering.|Sebastian Farquhar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13011)|null|
|**2025-01-22**|**Pairwise RM: Perform Best-of-N Sampling with Knockout Tournament**|Best-of-N (BoN) sampling, a common strategy for test-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs), relies on reward models to select the best candidate solution from multiple generations. However, traditional reward models often assign arbitrary and inconsistent scores, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose a Pairwise Reward Model (Pairwise RM) combined with a knockout tournament for BoN sampling. Instead of assigning absolute scores, given one math problem, Pairwise RM evaluates two candidate solutions' correctness simultaneously. This approach eliminates the need for arbitrary scoring and enables cross-validation of solutions through parallel comparison. In the knockout tournament, Pairwise RM conducts pairwise comparisons between candidate solutions and eliminates the incorrect ones iteratively. We construct \ourdataset, a large-scale dataset of 443K pairwise comparisons derived from NumiaMath and annotated using \texttt{gemini-1.5-flash}, and train the Pairwise RM via supervised fine-tuning. Experiments on MATH-500 and the Olympiad Bench demonstrate significant improvements over traditional discriminative reward models. And a 40\% to 60\% relative improvement is achieved on the top 50\% challenging problems.|Yantao Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13007)|**[link](https://github.com/thu-keg/pairwiserm)**|

This transformative capability lays the foundation for semantic communications, enabling highly efficient and intelligent communication systems. In this work, we present a novel OFDM-based semantic communication framework for image transmission. We propose an innovative semantic encoder design that leverages the ability of LLMs to extract the meaning of transmitted data rather than focusing on its raw representation. On the receiver side, we design an LLM-based semantic decoder capable of comprehending context and generating the most appropriate representation to fit the given context. We evaluate our proposed system under different scenarios, including Urban Macro-cell environments with varying speed ranges. The evaluation metrics demonstrate that our proposed system reduces the data size 4250 times, while achieving a higher data rate compared to conventional communication methods.

These tasks can leverage joint learning based on channel characteristics to share representations and enhance system design. To capitalize on this advantage, LLM4WM is proposed--a large language model (LLM) multi-task fine-tuning framework specifically tailored for channel-associated tasks. This framework utilizes a Mixture of Experts with Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) approach for multi-task fine-tuning, enabling the transfer of the pre-trained LLM's general knowledge to these tasks. Given the unique characteristics of wireless channel data, preprocessing modules, adapter modules, and multi-task output layers are designed to align the channel data with the LLM's semantic feature space. Experiments on a channel-associated multi-task dataset demonstrate that LLM4WM outperforms existing methodologies in both full-sample and few-shot evaluations, owing to its robust multi-task joint modeling and transfer learning capabilities.|Xuanyu Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12983)|null|

Beyond the comparison as such, we aim to develop a benchmark to assess the capabilities of LLMs with discourse biases as a robust proxy for more general discourse understanding capabilities. More specifically, we investigated Implicit Causality verbs, for which psycholinguistic research has found participants to display biases with regard to three phenomena:\ the establishment of (i) coreference relations (Experiment 1), (ii) coherence relations (Experiment 2), and (iii) the use of particular referring expressions (Experiments 3 and 4). With regard to coreference biases we found only the largest monolingual LLM (German Bloom 6.4B) to display more human-like biases. For coherence relation, no LLM displayed the explanation bias usually found for humans. For referring expressions, all LLMs displayed a preference for referring to subject arguments with simpler forms than to objects. However, no bias effect on referring expression was found, as opposed to recent studies investigating human biases.|Florian Kankowski et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12980)|null|

Within the LLM family, smaller models (those with fewer than 10 billion parameters) also perform well across various tasks. However, these smaller models share similar limitations to their larger counterparts, including the tendency to hallucinate. Despite the existence of many benchmarks to evaluate hallucination in LLMs, few have specifically focused on small LLMs (SLLMs). Additionally, SLLMs show widely varying performance across different benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce OnionEval, a multi-layer structured framework with a specific metric called the context-influence score (CI), designed to effectively assess the fact-conflicting hallucination tendencies of small LLMs across different contextual levels. Our experimental results reveal a key feature of SLLMs: they excel in factual analysis but face challenges with context reasoning. Further investigation shows that a simple Chain-of-Thought strategy can significantly reduce these limitations, improving the practical usefulness of SLLMs in real-world applications.|Chongren Sun et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12975)|**[link](https://github.com/sunchongren/onioneval)**|
|**2025-01-22**|**Accessible Smart Contracts Verification: Synthesizing Formal Models with Tamed LLMs**|When blockchain systems are said to be trustless, what this really means is that all the trust is put into software. Thus, there are strong incentives to ensure blockchain software is correct -- vulnerabilities here cost millions and break businesses. One of the most powerful ways of establishing software correctness is by using formal methods. Approaches based on formal methods, however, induce a significant overhead in terms of time and expertise required to successfully employ them. Our work addresses this critical disadvantage by automating the creation of a formal model -- a mathematical abstraction of the software system -- which is often a core task when employing formal methods. We perform model synthesis in three phases: we first transpile the code into model stubs; then we "fill in the blanks" using a large language model (LLM); finally, we iteratively repair the generated model, on both syntactical and semantical level. In this way, we significantly reduce the amount of time necessary to create formal models and increase accessibility of valuable software verification methods that rely on them. The practical context of our work was reducing the time-to-value of using formal models for correctness audits of smart contracts.|Jan Corazza et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12972)|null|

As a result, we develop a new version of InternVideo2.5 with a focus on enhancing the original MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained details and capture long-form temporal structure in videos. Specifically, our approach incorporates dense vision task annotations into MLLMs using direct preference optimization and develops compact spatiotemporal representations through adaptive hierarchical token compression. Experimental results demonstrate this unique design of LRC greatly improves the results of video MLLM in mainstream video understanding benchmarks (short & long), enabling the MLLM to memorize significantly longer video inputs (at least 6x longer than the original), and master specialized vision capabilities like object tracking and segmentation. Our work highlights the importance of multimodal context richness (length and fineness) in empowering MLLM's innate abilites (focus and memory), providing new insights for future research on video MLLM.

|**2025-01-21**|**Expertise elevates AI usage: experimental evidence comparing laypeople and professional artists**|Novel capacities of generative AI to analyze and generate cultural artifacts raise inevitable questions about the nature and value of artistic education and human expertise. Has AI already leveled the playing field between professional artists and laypeople, or do trained artistic expressive capacity, curation skills and experience instead enhance the ability to use these new tools? In this pre-registered study, we conduct experimental comparisons between 50 active artists and a demographically matched sample of laypeople. We designed two tasks to approximate artistic practice for testing their capabilities in both faithful and creative image creation: replicating a reference image, and moving as far away as possible from it. We developed a bespoke platform where participants used a modern text-to-image model to complete both tasks. We also collected and compared participants' sentiments towards AI. On average, artists produced more faithful and creative outputs than their lay counterparts, although only by a small margin. While AI may ease content creation, professional expertise is still valuable - even within the confined space of generative AI itself. Finally, we also explored how well an exemplary vision-capable large language model (GPT-4o) would complete the same tasks, if given the role of an image generation agent, and found it performed on par in copying but outperformed even artists in the creative task. The very best results were still produced by humans in both tasks. These outcomes highlight the importance of integrating artistic skills with AI training to prepare artists and other visual professionals for a technologically evolving landscape. We see a potential in collaborative synergy with generative AI, which could reshape creative industries and education in the arts.|Thomas F.

Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information.   In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve a strong performance with 67.41\% on BIRD benchmark (dev) without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.|Yeounoh Chung et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372)|null|

Learning-guided execution has been proposed as an approach to enable the execution of arbitrary code snippets by letting a neural model predict likely values for any missing variables. Although state-of-the-art learning-guided execution approaches, such as LExecutor, can enable the execution of a relative high amount of code, they are limited to predicting a restricted set of possible values and do not use any feedback from previous executions to execute even more code. This paper presents Treefix, a novel learning-guided execution approach that leverages LLMs to iteratively create code prefixes that enable the execution of a given code snippet. The approach addresses the problem in a multi-step fashion, where each step uses feedback about the code snippet and its execution to instruct an LLM to improve a previously generated prefix. This process iteratively creates a tree of prefixes, a subset of which is returned to the user as prefixes that maximize the number of executed lines in the code snippet. In our experiments with two datasets of Python code snippets, Treefix achieves 25% and 7% more coverage relative to the current state of the art in learning-guided execution, covering a total of 84% and 82% of all lines in the code snippets.|Beatriz Souza et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12339)|null|

Recently Large Language Models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, have shown great promises in labelling data with high accuracy. However, privacy and cost concerns prevent the ubiquitous use of GPT-4. In this work, we explore effectively leveraging open-source models for automatic labelling. We identify integrating label schema as a promising technology but found that naively using the label description for classification leads to poor performance on high cardinality tasks. To address this, we propose Retrieval Augmented Classification (RAC) for which LLM performs inferences for one label at a time using corresponding label schema; we start with the most related label and iterates until a label is chosen by the LLM. We show that our method, which dynamically integrates label description, leads to performance improvements in labelling tasks. We further show that by focusing only on the most promising labels, RAC can trade off between label quality and coverage - a property we leverage to automatically label our internal datasets.|Thomas Walshe et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12332)|null|

This paper introduces an innovative approach to higher education curriculum modelling that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph (KG) completion, with the goal of creating personalized learning-path recommendations. Our research focuses on modelling university subjects and linking their topics to corresponding domain models, enabling the integration of learning modules from different faculties and institutions in the student's learning path. Central to our approach is a collaborative process, where LLMs assist human experts in extracting high-quality, fine-grained topics from lecture materials. We develop a domain, curriculum, and user models for university modules and stakeholders. We implement this model to create the KG from two study modules: Embedded Systems and Development of Embedded Systems Using FPGA. The resulting KG structures the curriculum and links it to the domain models. We evaluate our approach through qualitative expert feedback and quantitative graph quality metrics. Domain experts validated the relevance and accuracy of the model, while the graph quality metrics measured the structural properties of our KG. Our results show that the LLM-assisted graph completion approach enhances the ability to connect related courses across disciplines to personalize the learning experience.

While deep learning approaches show exceptional performance in traffic prediction, most assume sensors at all locations of interest, which is impractical due to financial constraints. Furthermore, these methods typically require costly retraining when sensor configurations change. We propose MoGERNN, an inductive spatio-temporal graph representation model, to address these challenges. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts approach in Large Language Models, we introduce a Mixture of Graph Expert (MoGE) block to model complex spatial dependencies through multiple graph message aggregators and a sparse gating network. This block estimates initial states for unobserved locations, which are then processed by a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder that integrates a graph message aggregator to capture spatio-temporal dependencies and predict future states. Experiments on two real-world datasets show MoGERNN consistently outperforms baseline methods for both observed and unobserved locations. MoGERNN can accurately predict congestion evolution even in areas without sensors, offering valuable information for traffic management. Moreover, MoGERNN is adaptable to dynamic sensing networks, maintaining competitive performance even compared to its retrained counterpart. Tests with different numbers of available sensors confirm its consistent superiority, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of its key modules.|Qishen Zhou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12281)|**[link](https://github.com/youxiaotu/MoGERNN)**|

In this work, we introduce Condor, a novel two-stage synthetic data generation framework that incorporates World Knowledge Tree and Self-Reflection Refinement to produce high-quality SFT data at scale. Our experimental results demonstrate that a base model fine-tuned on only 20K Condor-generated samples achieves superior performance compared to counterparts. The additional refinement stage in Condor further enables iterative self-improvement for LLMs at various scales (up to 72B), validating the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our investigation into the scaling for synthetic data in post-training reveals substantial unexplored potential for performance improvements, opening promising avenues for future research.|Maosong Cao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12273)|null|

Based on the documented success of Adam, learning rate decay, and weight decay, we hypothesize that the pre-training loss landscape features a narrowing valley structure. Through experiments with synthetic loss functions, we discover that when gradient query noise is high relative to the valley's sharpness, Adam's performance falls behind that of Signum because Adam reduces the effective step size too drastically. This observation led us to develop FOCUS, an optimizer that enhances Signum by incorporating attraction toward moving averaged parameters, allowing it to handle noise better while maintaining larger step sizes. In training GPT-2, FOCUS proves to be more stable than Signum and faster than Adam. These results suggest that gradient noise may be an underappreciated limiting factor in LLM training, and FOCUS offers promising solutions.|Yizhou Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12243)|null|

However, their capacity for face understanding has not been systematically studied. To address this gap, we introduce FaceXBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs on complex face understanding tasks. FaceXBench includes 5,000 multimodal multiple-choice questions derived from 25 public datasets and a newly created dataset, FaceXAPI. These questions cover 14 tasks across 6 broad categories, assessing MLLMs' face understanding abilities in bias and fairness, face authentication, recognition, analysis, localization and tool retrieval. Using FaceXBench, we conduct an extensive evaluation of 26 open-source MLLMs alongside 2 proprietary models, revealing the unique challenges in complex face understanding tasks. We analyze the models across three evaluation settings: zero-shot, in-context task description, and chain-of-thought prompting. Our detailed analysis reveals that current MLLMs, including advanced models like GPT-4o, and GeminiPro 1.5, show significant room for improvement. We believe FaceXBench will be a crucial resource for developing MLLMs equipped to perform sophisticated face understanding.

However, the discrepancy between offline metrics and online performance significantly impedes their progress. To address this challenge, we introduce Agent4Edu, a novel personalized learning simulator leveraging recent advancements in human intelligence through large language models (LLMs). Agent4Edu features LLM-powered generative agents equipped with learner profile, memory, and action modules tailored to personalized learning algorithms. The learner profiles are initialized using real-world response data, capturing practice styles and cognitive factors. Inspired by human psychology theory, the memory module records practice facts and high-level summaries, integrating reflection mechanisms. The action module supports various behaviors, including exercise understanding, analysis, and response generation. Each agent can interact with personalized learning algorithms, such as computerized adaptive testing, enabling a multifaceted evaluation and enhancement of customized services. Through a comprehensive assessment, we explore the strengths and weaknesses of Agent4Edu, emphasizing the consistency and discrepancies in responses between agents and human learners.

|**2025-01-17**|**Large language models for automated scholarly paper review: A survey**|Large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted human society, influencing various domains. Among them, academia is not simply a domain affected by LLMs, but it is also the pivotal force in the development of LLMs. In academic publications, this phenomenon is represented during the incorporation of LLMs into the peer review mechanism for reviewing manuscripts. We proposed the concept of automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) in our previous paper. As the incorporation grows, it now enters the coexistence phase of ASPR and peer review, which is described in that paper. LLMs hold transformative potential for the full-scale implementation of ASPR, but they also pose new issues and challenges that need to be addressed. In this survey paper, we aim to provide a holistic view of ASPR in the era of LLMs. We begin with a survey to find out which LLMs are used to conduct ASPR. Then, we review what ASPR-related technological bottlenecks have been solved with the incorporation of LLM technology. After that, we move on to explore new methods, new datasets, new source code, and new online systems that come with LLMs for ASPR. Furthermore, we summarize the performance and issues of LLMs in ASPR, and investigate the attitudes and reactions of publishers and academia to ASPR. Lastly, we discuss the challenges associated with the development of LLMs for ASPR. We hope this survey can serve as an inspirational reference for the researchers and promote the progress of ASPR for its actual implementation.|Zhenzhen Zhuang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10326)|null|
|**2025-01-17**|**Towards Human-Guided, Data-Centric LLM Co-Pilots**|Machine learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, but its adoption is often hindered by the disconnect between the needs of domain experts and translating these needs into robust and valid ML tools. Despite recent advances in LLM-based co-pilots to democratize ML for non-technical domain experts, these systems remain predominantly focused on model-centric aspects while overlooking critical data-centric challenges. This limitation is problematic in complex real-world settings where raw data often contains complex issues, such as missing values, label noise, and domain-specific nuances requiring tailored handling. To address this we introduce CliMB-DC, a human-guided, data-centric framework for LLM co-pilots that combines advanced data-centric tools with LLM-driven reasoning to enable robust, context-aware data processing. At its core, CliMB-DC introduces a novel, multi-agent reasoning system that combines a strategic coordinator for dynamic planning and adaptation with a specialized worker agent for precise execution. Domain expertise is then systematically incorporated to guide the reasoning process using a human-in-the-loop approach. To guide development, we formalize a taxonomy of key data-centric challenges that co-pilots must address. Thereafter, to address the dimensions of the taxonomy, we integrate state-of-the-art data-centric tools into an extensible, open-source architecture, facilitating the addition of new tools from the research community. Empirically, using real-world healthcare datasets we demonstrate CliMB-DC's ability to transform uncurated datasets into ML-ready formats, significantly outperforming existing co-pilot baselines for handling data-centric challenges. CliMB-DC promises to empower domain experts from diverse domains -- healthcare, finance, social sciences and more -- to actively participate in driving real-world impact using ML.|Evgeny Saveliev et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10321)|null|
|**2025-01-17**|**HiMix: Reducing Computational Complexity in Large Vision-Language Models**|Benefiting from recent advancements in large language models and modality alignment techniques, existing Large Vision-Language Models(LVLMs) have achieved prominent performance across a wide range of scenarios. However, the excessive computational complexity limits the widespread use of these models in practical applications. We argue that one main bottleneck in computational complexity is caused by the involvement of redundant vision sequences in model computation. This is inspired by a reassessment of the efficiency of vision and language information transmission in the language decoder of LVLMs. Then, we propose a novel hierarchical vision-language interaction mechanism called Hierarchical Vision injection for Mixture Attention (HiMix). In HiMix, only the language sequence undergoes full forward propagation, while the vision sequence interacts with the language at specific stages within each language decoder layer. It is striking that our approach significantly reduces computational complexity with minimal performance loss. Specifically, HiMix achieves a 10x reduction in the computational cost of the language decoder across multiple LVLM models while maintaining comparable performance. This highlights the advantages of our method, and we hope our research brings new perspectives to the field of vision-language understanding.

|**2025-01-17**|**Towards Preventing Overreliance on Task-Oriented Conversational AI Through Accountability Modeling**|Recent LLMs have enabled significant advancements for conversational agents. However, they are also well-known to hallucinate, i.e., they often produce responses that seem plausible but are not factually correct. On the other hand, users tend to over-rely on LLM-based AI agents; they accept the AI's suggestion even when it is wrong. Adding good friction, such as explanations or getting user confirmations, has been proposed as a mitigation in AI-supported decision-making systems. In this paper, we propose an accountability model for LLM-based task-oriented dialogue agents to address user overreliance via friction turns in cases of model uncertainty and errors associated with dialogue state tracking (DST). The accountability model is an augmented LLM with an additional accountability head, which functions as a binary classifier to predict the slots of the dialogue states. We perform our experiments with three backbone LLMs (Llama, Mistral, Gemma) on two established task-oriented datasets (MultiWOZ and Snips). Our empirical findings demonstrate that this approach not only enables reliable estimation of AI agent errors but also guides the LLM decoder in generating more accurate actions. We observe around 3% absolute improvement in joint goal accuracy by incorporating accountability heads in modern LLMs for the MultiWOZ dataset. We also show that this method enables the agent to self-correct its actions, further boosting its performance by 3%. Finally, we discuss the application of accountability modeling to prevent user overreliance by introducing friction.|Suvodip Dey et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10316)|**[link](https://github.com/uiuc-conversational-ai-lab/accountable-dst)**|
|**2025-01-17**|**Addressing Popularity Bias in Third-Party Library Recommendations Using LLMs**|Recommender systems for software engineering (RSSE) play a crucial role in automating development tasks by providing relevant suggestions according to the developer's context. However, they suffer from the so-called popularity bias, i.e., the phenomenon of recommending popular items that might be irrelevant to the current task. In particular, the long-tail effect can hamper the system's performance in terms of accuracy, thus leading to false positives in the provided recommendations. Foundation models are the most advanced generative AI-based models that achieve relevant results in several SE tasks.   This paper aims to investigate the capability of large language models (LLMs) to address the popularity bias in recommender systems of third-party libraries (TPLs). We conduct an ablation study experimenting with state-of-the-art techniques to mitigate the popularity bias, including fine-tuning and popularity penalty mechanisms. Our findings reveal that the considered LLMs cannot address the popularity bias in TPL recommenders, even though fine-tuning and post-processing penalty mechanism contributes to increasing the overall diversity of the provided recommendations. In addition, we discuss the limitations of LLMs in this context and suggest potential improvements to address the popularity bias in TPL recommenders, thus paving the way for additional experiments in this direction.|Claudio Di Sipio et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10313)|null|
|**2025-01-17**|**Computational Protein Science in the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs)**|Considering the significance of proteins, computational protein science has always been a critical scientific field, dedicated to revealing knowledge and developing applications within the protein sequence-structure-function paradigm. In the last few decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant impacts in computational protein science, leading to notable successes in specific protein modeling tasks. However, those previous AI models still meet limitations, such as the difficulty in comprehending the semantics of protein sequences, and the inability to generalize across a wide range of protein modeling tasks. Recently, LLMs have emerged as a milestone in AI due to their unprecedented language processing & generalization capability. They can promote comprehensive progress in fields rather than solving individual tasks. As a result, researchers have actively introduced LLM techniques in computational protein science, developing protein Language Models (pLMs) that skillfully grasp the foundational knowledge of proteins and can be effectively generalized to solve a diversity of sequence-structure-function reasoning problems. While witnessing prosperous developments, it's necessary to present a systematic overview of computational protein science empowered by LLM techniques. First, we summarize existing pLMs into categories based on their mastered protein knowledge, i.e., underlying sequence patterns, explicit structural and functional information, and external scientific languages. Second, we introduce the utilization and adaptation of pLMs, highlighting their remarkable achievements in promoting protein structure prediction, protein function prediction, and protein design studies. Then, we describe the practical application of pLMs in antibody design, enzyme design, and drug discovery. Finally, we specifically discuss the promising future directions in this fast-growing field.|Wenqi Fan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10282)|null|
|**2025-01-17**|**Test Wars: A Comparative Study of SBST, Symbolic Execution, and LLM-Based Approaches to Unit Test Generation**|Generating tests automatically is a key and ongoing area of focus in software engineering research. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up new opportunities, given their ability to perform a wide spectrum of tasks. However, the effectiveness of LLM-based approaches compared to traditional techniques such as search-based software testing (SBST) and symbolic execution remains uncertain. In this paper, we perform an extensive study of automatic test generation approaches based on three tools: EvoSuite for SBST, Kex for symbolic execution, and TestSpark for LLM-based test generation. We evaluate tools performance on the GitBug Java dataset and compare them using various execution-based and feature-based metrics. Our results show that while LLM-based test generation is promising, it falls behind traditional methods in terms of coverage. However, it significantly outperforms them in mutation scores, suggesting that LLMs provide a deeper semantic understanding of code. LLM-based approach also performed worse than SBST and symbolic execution-based approaches w.r.t. fault detection capabilities. Additionally, our feature-based analysis shows that all tools are primarily affected by the complexity and internal dependencies of the class under test (CUT), with LLM-based approaches being especially sensitive to the CUT size.|Azat Abdullin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10200)|null|

Generative AI is also being used widely in education, performing well in academic courses and their assessments. This review summarizes the successes of LLMs and highlights some of their challenges in the context of education, most notably aspects that may undermines the acquisition of knowledge and skills for professional work. It then provides recommendations for best practices overcoming shortcomings for LLM use in education.

|**2025-01-16**|**Distilling Multi-modal Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving**|Autonomous driving demands safe motion planning, especially in critical "long-tail" scenarios. Recent end-to-end autonomous driving systems leverage large language models (LLMs) as planners to improve generalizability to rare events. However, using LLMs at test time introduces high computational costs. To address this, we propose DiMA, an end-to-end autonomous driving system that maintains the efficiency of an LLM-free (or vision-based) planner while leveraging the world knowledge of an LLM. DiMA distills the information from a multi-modal LLM to a vision-based end-to-end planner through a set of specially designed surrogate tasks. Under a joint training strategy, a scene encoder common to both networks produces structured representations that are semantically grounded as well as aligned to the final planning objective. Notably, the LLM is optional at inference, enabling robust planning without compromising on efficiency. Training with DiMA results in a 37% reduction in the L2 trajectory error and an 80% reduction in the collision rate of the vision-based planner, as well as a 44% trajectory error reduction in longtail scenarios. DiMA also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes planning benchmark.|Deepti Hegde et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09757)|null|
|**2025-01-16**|**Lost in Translation, Found in Context: Sign Language Translation with Contextual Cues**|Our objective is to translate continuous sign language into spoken language text. Inspired by the way human interpreters rely on context for accurate translation, we incorporate additional contextual cues together with the signing video, into a new translation framework. Specifically, besides visual sign recognition features that encode the input video, we integrate complementary textual information from (i) captions describing the background show, (ii) translation of previous sentences, as well as (iii) pseudo-glosses transcribing the signing. These are automatically extracted and inputted along with the visual features to a pre-trained large language model (LLM), which we fine-tune to generate spoken language translations in text form. Through extensive ablation studies, we show the positive contribution of each input cue to the translation performance. We train and evaluate our approach on BOBSL -- the largest British Sign Language dataset currently available. We show that our contextual approach significantly enhances the quality of the translations compared to previously reported results on BOBSL, and also to state-of-the-art methods that we implement as baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by applying it also to How2Sign, an American Sign Language dataset, and achieve competitive results.|Youngjoon Jang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09754)|null|
|**2025-01-16**|**OmniThink: Expanding Knowledge Boundaries in Machine Writing through Thinking**|Machine writing with large language models often relies on retrieval-augmented generation. However, these approaches remain confined within the boundaries of the model's predefined scope, limiting the generation of content with rich information. Specifically, vanilla-retrieved information tends to lack depth, utility, and suffers from redundancy, which negatively impacts the quality of generated articles, leading to shallow, repetitive, and unoriginal outputs. To address these issues, we propose OmniThink, a machine writing framework that emulates the human-like process of iterative expansion and reflection. The core idea behind OmniThink is to simulate the cognitive behavior of learners as they progressively deepen their knowledge of the topics. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniThink improves the knowledge density of generated articles without compromising metrics such as coherence and depth. Human evaluations and expert feedback further highlight the potential of OmniThink to address real-world challenges in the generation of long-form articles.|Zekun Xi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09751)|null|
|**2025-01-16**|**Enhancing Lexicon-Based Text Embeddings with Large Language Models**|Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on general-purpose text embedding tasks. While dense embeddings have dominated related research, we introduce the first Lexicon-based EmbeddiNgS (LENS) leveraging LLMs that achieve competitive performance on these tasks. Regarding the inherent tokenization redundancy issue and unidirectional attention limitations in traditional causal LLMs, LENS consolidates the vocabulary space through token embedding clustering, and investigates bidirectional attention and various pooling strategies. Specifically, LENS simplifies lexicon matching by assigning each dimension to a specific token cluster, where semantically similar tokens are grouped together, and unlocking the full potential of LLMs through bidirectional attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LENS outperforms dense embeddings on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), delivering compact feature representations that match the sizes of dense counterparts. Notably, combining LENSE with dense embeddings achieves state-of-the-art performance on the retrieval subset of MTEB (i.e. BEIR).|Yibin Lei et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09749)|null|
|**2025-01-16**|**Suggesting Code Edits in Interactive Machine Learning Notebooks Using Large Language Models**|Machine learning developers frequently use interactive computational notebooks, such as Jupyter notebooks, to host code for data processing and model training. Jupyter notebooks provide a convenient tool for writing machine learning pipelines and interactively observing outputs, however, maintaining Jupyter notebooks, e.g., to add new features or fix bugs, can be challenging due to the length and complexity of the notebooks. Moreover, there is no existing benchmark related to developer edits on Jupyter notebooks. To address this, we present the first dataset of 48,398 Jupyter notebook edits derived from 20,095 revisions of 792 machine learning repositories on GitHub, and perform the first study of the using LLMs to predict code edits in Jupyter notebooks. Our dataset captures granular details of cell-level and line-level modifications, offering a foundation for understanding real-world maintenance patterns in machine learning workflows. We observed that the edits on Jupyter notebooks are highly localized, with changes averaging only 166 lines of code in repositories. While larger models outperform smaller counterparts in code editing, all models have low accuracy on our dataset even after finetuning, demonstrating the complexity of real-world machine learning maintenance tasks. Our findings emphasize the critical role of contextual information in improving model performance and point toward promising avenues for advancing large language models' capabilities in engineering machine learning code.|Bihui Jin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09745)|null|
|**2025-01-16**|**Inference-Time Scaling for Diffusion Models beyond Scaling Denoising Steps**|Generative models have made significant impacts across various domains, largely due to their ability to scale during training by increasing data, computational resources, and model size, a phenomenon characterized by the scaling laws. Recent research has begun to explore inference-time scaling behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing how performance can further improve with additional computation during inference. Unlike LLMs, diffusion models inherently possess the flexibility to adjust inference-time computation via the number of denoising steps, although the performance gains typically flatten after a few dozen. In this work, we explore the inference-time scaling behavior of diffusion models beyond increasing denoising steps and investigate how the generation performance can further improve with increased computation. Specifically, we consider a search problem aimed at identifying better noises for the diffusion sampling process. We structure the design space along two axes: the verifiers used to provide feedback, and the algorithms used to find better noise candidates. Through extensive experiments on class-conditioned and text-conditioned image generation benchmarks, our findings reveal that increasing inference-time compute leads to substantial improvements in the quality of samples generated by diffusion models, and with the complicated nature of images, combinations of the components in the framework can be specifically chosen to conform with different application scenario.|Nanye Ma et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09732)|null|
|**2025-01-16**|**CyberMentor: AI Powered Learning Tool Platform to Address Diverse Student Needs in Cybersecurity Education**|Many non-traditional students in cybersecurity programs often lack access to advice from peers, family members and professors, which can hinder their educational experiences. Additionally, these students may not fully benefit from various LLM-powered AI assistants due to issues like content relevance, locality of advice, minimum expertise, and timing. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing an application designed to provide comprehensive support by answering questions related to knowledge, skills, and career preparation advice tailored to the needs of these students. We developed a learning tool platform, CyberMentor, to address the diverse needs and pain points of students majoring in cybersecurity. Powered by agentic workflow and Generative Large Language Models (LLMs), the platform leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for accurate and contextually relevant information retrieval to achieve accessibility and personalization. We demonstrated its value in addressing knowledge requirements for cybersecurity education and for career marketability, in tackling skill requirements for analytical and programming assignments, and in delivering real time on demand learning support. Using three use scenarios, we showcased CyberMentor in facilitating knowledge acquisition and career preparation and providing seamless skill-based guidance and support. We also employed the LangChain prompt-based evaluation methodology to evaluate the platform's impact, confirming its strong performance in helpfulness, correctness, and completeness. These results underscore the system's ability to support students in developing practical cybersecurity skills while improving equity and sustainability within higher education. Furthermore, CyberMentor's open-source design allows for adaptation across other disciplines, fostering educational innovation and broadening its potential impact.|Tianyu Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09709)|null|

These models are meant as foundation models with deep knowledge about e-commerce, that form a base for instruction- and fine-tuning. The e-Llama models are obtained by continuously pretraining the Llama 3.1 base models on 1 trillion tokens of domain-specific data.   We discuss our approach and motivate our choice of hyperparameters with a series of ablation studies. To quantify how well the models have been adapted to the e-commerce domain, we define and implement a set of multilingual, e-commerce specific evaluation tasks.   We show that, when carefully choosing the training setup, the Llama 3.1 models can be adapted towards the new domain without sacrificing significant performance on general domain tasks. We also explore the possibility of merging the adapted model and the base model for a better control of the performance trade-off between domains.|Christian Herold et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09706)|null|
|**2025-01-16**|**Simulated Interactive Debugging**|Debugging software, i.e., the localization of faults and their repair, is a main activity in software engineering. Therefore, effective and efficient debugging is one of the core skills a software engineer must develop. However, the teaching of debugging techniques is usually very limited or only taught in indirect ways, e.g., during software projects. As a result, most Computer Science (CS) students learn debugging only in an ad-hoc and unstructured way. In this work, we present our approach called Simulated Interactive Debugging that interactively guides students along the debugging process. The guidance aims to empower the students to repair their solutions and have a proper "learning" experience. We envision that such guided debugging techniques can be integrated into programming courses early in the CS education curriculum. To perform an initial evaluation, we developed a prototypical implementation using traditional fault localization techniques and large language models. Students can use features like the automated setting of breakpoints or an interactive chatbot. We designed and executed a controlled experiment that included this IDE-integrated tooling with eight undergraduate CS students. Based on the responses, we conclude that the participants liked the systematic guidance by the assisted debugger. In particular, they rated the automated setting of breakpoints as the most effective, followed by the interactive debugging and chatting, and the explanations for how breakpoints were set. In our future work, we will improve our concept and implementation, add new features, and perform more intensive user studies.|Yannic Noller et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09694)|null|
|**2025-01-16**|**Towards Large Reasoning Models: A Survey of Reinforced Reasoning with Large Language Models**|Language has long been conceived as an essential tool for human reasoning. The breakthrough of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant research interest in leveraging these models to tackle complex reasoning tasks. Researchers have moved beyond simple autoregressive token generation by introducing the concept of "thought" -- a sequence of tokens representing intermediate steps in the reasoning process. This innovative paradigm enables LLMs' to mimic complex human reasoning processes, such as tree search and reflective thinking. Recently, an emerging trend of learning to reason has applied reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to master reasoning processes. This approach enables the automatic generation of high-quality reasoning trajectories through trial-and-error search algorithms, significantly expanding LLMs' reasoning capacity by providing substantially more training data. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that encouraging LLMs to "think" with more tokens during test-time inference can further significantly boost reasoning accuracy. Therefore, the train-time and test-time scaling combined to show a new research frontier -- a path toward Large Reasoning Model. The introduction of OpenAI's o1 series marks a significant milestone in this research direction. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent progress in LLM reasoning. We begin by introducing the foundational background of LLMs and then explore the key technical components driving the development of large reasoning models, with a focus on automated data construction, learning-to-reason techniques, and test-time scaling. We also analyze popular open-source projects at building large reasoning models, and conclude with open challenges and future research directions.|Fengli Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09686)|null|

To facilitate this investigation, we construct MM-StyleBench, a novel high-quality dataset for benchmarking artistic stylization. We then develop a principled method for human preference modeling and perform a systematic correlation analysis between MLLMs' responses and human preference. Our experiments reveal an inherent hallucination issue of MLLMs in art evaluation, associated with response subjectivity. ArtCoT is proposed, demonstrating that art-specific task decomposition and the use of concrete language boost MLLMs' reasoning ability for aesthetics. Our findings offer valuable insights into MLLMs for art and can benefit a wide range of downstream applications, such as style transfer and artistic image generation.

|**2025-01-15**|**Aegis2.0: A Diverse AI Safety Dataset and Risks Taxonomy for Alignment of LLM Guardrails**|As Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI become increasingly widespread, concerns about content safety have grown in parallel. Currently, there is a clear lack of high-quality, human-annotated datasets that address the full spectrum of LLM-related safety risks and are usable for commercial applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive and adaptable taxonomy for categorizing safety risks, structured into 12 top-level hazard categories with an extension to 9 fine-grained subcategories. This taxonomy is designed to meet the diverse requirements of downstream users, offering more granular and flexible tools for managing various risk types. Using a hybrid data generation pipeline that combines human annotations with a multi-LLM "jury" system to assess the safety of responses, we obtain Aegis 2.0, a carefully curated collection of 34,248 samples of human-LLM interactions, annotated according to our proposed taxonomy. To validate its effectiveness, we demonstrate that several lightweight models, trained using parameter-efficient techniques on Aegis 2.0, achieve performance competitive with leading safety models fully fine-tuned on much larger, non-commercial datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training blend that combines safety with topic following data.This approach enhances the adaptability of guard models, enabling them to generalize to new risk categories defined during inference. We plan to open-source Aegis 2.0 data and models to the research community to aid in the safety guardrailing of LLMs.|Shaona Ghosh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09004)|null|
|**2025-01-15**|**Development and Validation of the Provider Documentation Summarization Quality Instrument for Large Language Models**|As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into electronic health record (EHR) workflows, validated instruments are essential to evaluate their performance before implementation. Existing instruments for provider documentation quality are often unsuitable for the complexities of LLM-generated text and lack validation on real-world data. The Provider Documentation Summarization Quality Instrument (PDSQI-9) was developed to evaluate LLM-generated clinical summaries. Multi-document summaries were generated from real-world EHR data across multiple specialties using several LLMs (GPT-4o, Mixtral 8x7b, and Llama 3-8b). Validation included Pearson correlation for substantive validity, factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha for structural validity, inter-rater reliability (ICC and Krippendorff's alpha) for generalizability, a semi-Delphi process for content validity, and comparisons of high- versus low-quality summaries for discriminant validity. Seven physician raters evaluated 779 summaries and answered 8,329 questions, achieving over 80% power for inter-rater reliability. The PDSQI-9 demonstrated strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.879; 95% CI: 0.867-0.891) and high inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.867; 95% CI: 0.867-0.868), supporting structural validity and generalizability. Factor analysis identified a 4-factor model explaining 58% of the variance, representing organization, clarity, accuracy, and utility. Substantive validity was supported by correlations between note length and scores for Succinct (rho = -0.200, p = 0.029) and Organized (rho = -0.190, p = 0.037). Discriminant validity distinguished high- from low-quality summaries (p < 0.001). The PDSQI-9 demonstrates robust construct validity, supporting its use in clinical practice to evaluate LLM-generated summaries and facilitate safer integration of LLMs into healthcare workflows.|Emma Croxford et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08977)|null|
|**2025-01-15**|**Learning to Extract Cross-Domain Aspects and Understanding Sentiments Using Large Language Models**|Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ASBA) is a refined approach to sentiment analysis that aims to extract and classify sentiments based on specific aspects or features of a product, service, or entity. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis, which assigns a general sentiment score to entire reviews or texts, ABSA focuses on breaking down the text into individual components or aspects (e.g., quality, price, service) and evaluating the sentiment towards each. This allows for a more granular level of understanding of customer opinions, enabling businesses to pinpoint specific areas of strength and improvement. The process involves several key steps, including aspect extraction, sentiment classification, and aspect-level sentiment aggregation for a review paragraph or any other form that the users have provided. ABSA has significant applications in areas such as product reviews, social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research. By leveraging techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, ABSA facilitates the extraction of valuable insights, enabling companies to make data-driven decisions that enhance customer satisfaction and optimize offerings. As ABSA evolves, it holds the potential to greatly improve personalized customer experiences by providing a deeper understanding of sentiment across various product aspects. In this work, we have analyzed the strength of LLMs for a complete cross-domain aspect-based sentiment analysis with the aim of defining the framework for certain products and using it for other similar situations. We argue that it is possible to that at an effectiveness of 92\% accuracy for the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis dataset of SemEval-2015 Task 12.|Karukriti Kaushik Ghosh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08974)|null|
|**2025-01-15**|**Analyzing the Ethical Logic of Six Large Language Models**|This study examines the ethical reasoning of six prominent generative large language models: OpenAI GPT-4o, Meta LLaMA 3.1, Perplexity, Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google Gemini, and Mistral 7B. The research explores how these models articulate and apply ethical logic, particularly in response to moral dilemmas such as the Trolley Problem, and Heinz Dilemma. Departing from traditional alignment studies, the study adopts an explainability-transparency framework, prompting models to explain their ethical reasoning. This approach is analyzed through three established ethical typologies: the consequentialist-deontological analytic, Moral Foundations Theory, and the Kohlberg Stages of Moral Development Model. Findings reveal that LLMs exhibit largely convergent ethical logic, marked by a rationalist, consequentialist emphasis, with decisions often prioritizing harm minimization and fairness. Despite similarities in pre-training and model architecture, a mixture of nuanced and significant differences in ethical reasoning emerge across models, reflecting variations in fine-tuning and post-training processes. The models consistently display erudition, caution, and self-awareness, presenting ethical reasoning akin to a graduate-level discourse in moral philosophy. In striking uniformity these systems all describe their ethical reasoning as more sophisticated than what is characteristic of typical human moral logic.|W.

|**2025-01-15**|**Applying General Turn-taking Models to Conversational Human-Robot Interaction**|Turn-taking is a fundamental aspect of conversation, but current Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) systems often rely on simplistic, silence-based models, leading to unnatural pauses and interruptions. This paper investigates, for the first time, the application of general turn-taking models, specifically TurnGPT and Voice Activity Projection (VAP), to improve conversational dynamics in HRI. These models are trained on human-human dialogue data using self-supervised learning objectives, without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose methods for using these models in tandem to predict when a robot should begin preparing responses, take turns, and handle potential interruptions. We evaluated the proposed system in a within-subject study against a traditional baseline system, using the Furhat robot with 39 adults in a conversational setting, in combination with a large language model for autonomous response generation. The results show that participants significantly prefer the proposed system, and it significantly reduces response delays and interruptions.|Gabriel Skantze et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08946)|null|
|**2025-01-15**|**Physical AI Agents: Integrating Cognitive Intelligence with Real-World Action**|Vertical AI Agents are revolutionizing industries by delivering domain-specific intelligence and tailored solutions. However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks.   This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context.   Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.|Fouad Bousetouane et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08944)|null|
|**2025-01-15**|**Disentangling Exploration of Large Language Models by Optimal Exploitation**|Exploration is a crucial skill for self-improvement and open-ended problem-solving. However, it remains uncertain whether large language models can effectively explore the state-space. Existing evaluations predominantly focus on the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, often assessed in multi-armed bandit problems. In contrast, this work isolates exploration as the sole objective, tasking the agent with delivering information that enhances future returns. For the evaluation, we propose to decompose missing rewards into exploration and exploitation components by measuring the optimal achievable return for the states already explored. Our experiments with various LLMs reveal that most models struggle to sufficiently explore the state-space and that weak exploration is insufficient. We observe a positive correlation between model size and exploration performance, with larger models demonstrating superior capabilities. Furthermore, we show that our decomposition provides insights into differences in behaviors driven by agent instructions during prompt engineering, offering a valuable tool for refining LLM performance in exploratory tasks.|Tim Grams et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08925)|null|
|**2025-01-15**|**GenAI Content Detection Task 3: Cross-Domain Machine-Generated Text Detection Challenge**|Recently there have been many shared tasks targeting the detection of generated text from Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these shared tasks tend to focus either on cases where text is limited to one particular domain or cases where text can be from many domains, some of which may not be seen during test time. In this shared task, using the newly released RAID benchmark, we aim to answer whether or not models can detect generated text from a large, yet fixed, number of domains and LLMs, all of which are seen during training. Over the course of three months, our task was attempted by 9 teams with 23 detector submissions. We find that multiple participants were able to obtain accuracies of over 99% on machine-generated text from RAID while maintaining a 5% False Positive Rate -- suggesting that detectors are able to robustly detect text from many domains and models simultaneously. We discuss potential interpretations of this result and provide directions for future research.|Liam Dugan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08913)|null|
|**2025-01-15**|**Leveraging Large Language Models as Knowledge-Driven Agents for Reliable Retrosynthesis Planning**|Identifying reliable synthesis pathways in materials chemistry is a complex task, particularly in polymer science, due to the intricate and often non-unique nomenclature of macromolecules. To address this challenge, we propose an agent system that integrates large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs). By leveraging LLMs' powerful capabilities for extracting and recognizing chemical substance names, and storing the extracted data in a structured knowledge graph, our system fully automates the retrieval of relevant literatures, extraction of reaction data, database querying, construction of retrosynthetic pathway trees, further expansion through the retrieval of additional literature and recommendation of optimal reaction pathways. A novel Multi-branched Reaction Pathway Search (MBRPS) algorithm enables the exploration of all pathways, with a particular focus on multi-branched ones, helping LLMs overcome weak reasoning in multi-branched paths. This work represents the first attempt to develop a fully automated retrosynthesis planning agent tailored specially for macromolecules powered by LLMs. Applied to polyimide synthesis, our new approach constructs a retrosynthetic pathway tree with hundreds of pathways and recommends optimized routes, including both known and novel pathways, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for broader applications.|Qinyu Ma et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08897)|null|
|**2025-01-14**|**PokerBench: Training Large Language Models to become Professional Poker Players**|We introduce PokerBench - a benchmark for evaluating the poker-playing abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs excel in traditional NLP tasks, their application to complex, strategic games like poker poses a new challenge. Poker, an incomplete information game, demands a multitude of skills such as mathematics, reasoning, planning, strategy, and a deep understanding of game theory and human psychology. This makes Poker the ideal next frontier for large language models. PokerBench consists of a comprehensive compilation of 11,000 most important scenarios, split between pre-flop and post-flop play, developed in collaboration with trained poker players. We evaluate prominent models including GPT-4, ChatGPT 3.5, and various Llama and Gemma series models, finding that all state-of-the-art LLMs underperform in playing optimal poker. However, after fine-tuning, these models show marked improvements. We validate PokerBench by having models with different scores compete with each other, demonstrating that higher scores on PokerBench lead to higher win rates in actual poker games. Through gameplay between our fine-tuned model and GPT-4, we also identify limitations of simple supervised fine-tuning for learning optimal playing strategy, suggesting the need for more advanced methodologies for effectively training language models to excel in games. PokerBench thus presents a unique benchmark for a quick and reliable evaluation of the poker-playing ability of LLMs as well as a comprehensive benchmark to study the progress of LLMs in complex game-playing scenarios. The dataset and code will be made available at: \url{https://github.com/pokerllm/pokerbench}.|Richard Zhuang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08328)|**[link](https://github.com/pokerllm/pokerbench)**|
|**2025-01-14**|**Omni-RGPT: Unifying Image and Video Region-level Understanding via Token Marks**|We present Omni-RGPT, a multimodal large language model designed to facilitate region-level comprehension for both images and videos. To achieve consistent region representation across spatio-temporal dimensions, we introduce Token Mark, a set of tokens highlighting the target regions within the visual feature space. These tokens are directly embedded into spatial regions using region prompts (e.g., boxes or masks) and simultaneously incorporated into the text prompt to specify the target, establishing a direct connection between visual and text tokens. To further support robust video understanding without requiring tracklets, we introduce an auxiliary task that guides Token Mark by leveraging the consistency of the tokens, enabling stable region interpretation across the video. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale region-level video instruction dataset (RegVID-300k). Omni-RGPT achieves state-of-the-art results on image and video-based commonsense reasoning benchmarks while showing strong performance in captioning and referring expression comprehension tasks.|Miran Heo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08326)|null|

By leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques along with its multi-agent architecture, ADAM-1 synthesizes insights from diverse data sources and contextualizes findings using literature-driven evidence. Comparative evaluation against XGBoost revealed similar mean F1 scores but significantly reduced variance for ADAM-1, highlighting its robustness and consistency, particularly in small laboratory datasets. While currently tailored for binary classification tasks, future iterations aim to incorporate additional data modalities, such as neuroimaging and biomarkers, to broaden the scalability and applicability for Alzheimer's research and diagnostics.|Ziyuan Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08324)|null|

But do they become robust to similar real-world noise? In this paper, we investigate the effect of real-world spelling mistakes on the performance of 9 language models, with parameters ranging from 0.2B to 13B, in 3 different NLP tasks, namely Natural Language Inference (NLI), Name Entity Recognition (NER), and Intent Classification (IC). We perform our experiments on 6 different languages and build a dictionary of real-world noise for them using the Wikipedia edit history. We show that the performance gap of the studied models on the clean and noisy test data averaged across all the datasets and languages ranges from 2.3 to 4.3 absolute percentage points. In addition, mT5 models, in general, show more robustness compared to BLOOM, Falcon, and BERT-like models. In particular, mT5 (13B), was the most robust on average overall, across the 3 tasks, and in 4 of the 6 languages.|Amirhossein Aliakbarzadeh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08322)|**[link](https://github.com/caisa-lab/llms-real-world-noise-robustness)**|
|**2025-01-14**|**Enhancing Automated Interpretability with Output-Centric Feature Descriptions**|Automated interpretability pipelines generate natural language descriptions for the concepts represented by features in large language models (LLMs), such as plants or the first word in a sentence. These descriptions are derived using inputs that activate the feature, which may be a dimension or a direction in the model's representation space. However, identifying activating inputs is costly, and the mechanistic role of a feature in model behavior is determined both by how inputs cause a feature to activate and by how feature activation affects outputs. Using steering evaluations, we reveal that current pipelines provide descriptions that fail to capture the causal effect of the feature on outputs. To fix this, we propose efficient, output-centric methods for automatically generating feature descriptions. These methods use the tokens weighted higher after feature stimulation or the highest weight tokens after applying the vocabulary "unembedding" head directly to the feature. Our output-centric descriptions better capture the causal effect of a feature on model outputs than input-centric descriptions, but combining the two leads to the best performance on both input and output evaluations. Lastly, we show that output-centric descriptions can be used to find inputs that activate features previously thought to be "dead".|Yoav Gur-Arieh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08319)|**[link](https://github.com/yoavgur/feature-descriptions)**|

However, measuring hallucination can be challenging, as having humans verify model generations on-the-fly is both expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we release HALoGEN, a comprehensive hallucination benchmark consisting of: (1) 10,923 prompts for generative models spanning nine domains including programming, scientific attribution, and summarization, and (2) automatic high-precision verifiers for each use case that decompose LLM generations into atomic units, and verify each unit against a high-quality knowledge source. We use this framework to evaluate ~150,000 generations from 14 language models, finding that even the best-performing models are riddled with hallucinations (sometimes up to 86% of generated atomic facts depending on the domain). We further define a novel error classification for LLM hallucinations based on whether they likely stem from incorrect recollection of training data (Type A errors), or incorrect knowledge in training data (Type B errors), or are fabrication (Type C errors). We hope our framework provides a foundation to enable the principled study of why generative models hallucinate, and advances the development of trustworthy large language models.|Abhilasha Ravichander et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08292)|null|
|**2025-01-14**|**AfriHate: A Multilingual Collection of Hate Speech and Abusive Language Datasets for African Languages**|Hate speech and abusive language are global phenomena that need socio-cultural background knowledge to be understood, identified, and moderated. However, in many regions of the Global South, there have been several documented occurrences of (1) absence of moderation and (2) censorship due to the reliance on keyword spotting out of context. Further, high-profile individuals have frequently been at the center of the moderation process, while large and targeted hate speech campaigns against minorities have been overlooked. These limitations are mainly due to the lack of high-quality data in the local languages and the failure to include local communities in the collection, annotation, and moderation processes. To address this issue, we present AfriHate: a multilingual collection of hate speech and abusive language datasets in 15 African languages. Each instance in AfriHate is annotated by native speakers familiar with the local culture. We report the challenges related to the construction of the datasets and present various classification baseline results with and without using LLMs. The datasets, individual annotations, and hate speech and offensive language lexicons are available on https://github.com/AfriHate/AfriHate|Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08284)|null|
|**2025-01-14**|**LLaVA-ST: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Fine-Grained Spatial-Temporal Understanding**|Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising results, yet existing approaches struggle to effectively handle both temporal and spatial localization simultaneously. This challenge stems from two key issues: first, incorporating spatial-temporal localization introduces a vast number of coordinate combinations, complicating the alignment of linguistic and visual coordinate representations; second, encoding fine-grained temporal and spatial information during video feature compression is inherently difficult. To address these issues, we propose LLaVA-ST, a MLLM for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. In LLaVA-ST, we propose Language-Aligned Positional Embedding, which embeds the textual coordinate special token into the visual space, simplifying the alignment of fine-grained spatial-temporal correspondences. Additionally, we design the Spatial-Temporal Packer, which decouples the feature compression of temporal and spatial resolutions into two distinct point-to-region attention processing streams. Furthermore, we propose ST-Align dataset with 4.3M training samples for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. With ST-align, we present a progressive training pipeline that aligns the visual and textual feature through sequential coarse-to-fine stages.Additionally, we introduce an ST-Align benchmark to evaluate spatial-temporal interleaved fine-grained understanding tasks, which include Spatial-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) , Event Localization and Captioning (ELC) and Spatial Video Grounding (SVG). LLaVA-ST achieves outstanding performance on 11 benchmarks requiring fine-grained temporal, spatial, or spatial-temporal interleaving multimodal understanding.

However, there are concerns about their reliability in different domains of linguistic variations. Many works have proposed robustness evaluation measures for local adversarial attacks, but we need globally robust models unbiased to different language styles. We take a broader approach to explore a wider range of variations across sociodemographic dimensions to perform structured reliability tests on the reasoning capacity of language models. We extend the SocialIQA dataset to create diverse paraphrased sets conditioned on sociodemographic styles. The assessment aims to provide a deeper understanding of LLMs in (a) their capability of generating demographic paraphrases with engineered prompts and (b) their reasoning capabilities in real-world, complex language scenarios. We also explore measures such as perplexity, explainability, and ATOMIC performance of paraphrases for fine-grained reliability analysis of LLMs on these sets. We find that demographic-specific paraphrasing significantly impacts the performance of language models, indicating that the subtleties of language variations remain a significant challenge. The code and dataset will be made available for reproducibility and future research.|Pulkit Arora et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08276)|null|

We propose the concept of the Sustainable AI Trilemma, highlighting the tensions between AI capability, digital equity, and environmental sustainability. Through a systematic case study of LLM agents and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we analyze the energy costs embedded in memory module designs and introduce novel metrics to quantify the trade-offs between energy consumption and system performance. Our experimental results reveal significant energy inefficiencies in current memory-augmented frameworks and demonstrate that resource-constrained environments face disproportionate efficiency penalties.

To address it, we introduce WebWalkerQA, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to perform web traversal. It evaluates the capacity of LLMs to traverse a website's subpages to extract high-quality data systematically. We propose WebWalker, which is a multi-agent framework that mimics human-like web navigation through an explore-critic paradigm. Extensive experimental results show that WebWalkerQA is challenging and demonstrates the effectiveness of RAG combined with WebWalker, through the horizontal and vertical integration in real-world scenarios.|Jialong Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07572)|**[link](https://github.com/alibaba-nlp/webwalker)**|

Traditional metrics, such as CLIP text and image scores, often fall short: text scores are limited by inadequate training data and hierarchical dependencies, while image scores fail to assess temporal consistency. We present SST-EM (Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal Evaluation Metric), a novel evaluation framework that leverages modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Object Detection, and Temporal Consistency checks. SST-EM comprises four components: (1) semantic extraction from frames using a VLM, (2) primary object tracking with Object Detection, (3) focused object refinement via an LLM agent, and (4) temporal consistency assessment using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These components are integrated into a unified metric with weights derived from human evaluations and regression analysis. The name SST-EM reflects its focus on Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal aspects of video evaluation. SST-EM provides a comprehensive evaluation of semantic fidelity and temporal smoothness in video editing.

Yet, it struggles in complex spatial reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, human cognition extends beyond language alone, enabling the remarkable capability to think in both words and images. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose a new reasoning paradigm, Multimodal Visualization-of-Thought (MVoT). It enables visual thinking in MLLMs by generating image visualizations of their reasoning traces. To ensure high-quality visualization, we introduce token discrepancy loss into autoregressive MLLMs. This innovation significantly improves both visual coherence and fidelity. We validate this approach through several dynamic spatial reasoning tasks. Experimental results reveal that MVoT demonstrates competitive performance across tasks. Moreover, it exhibits robust and reliable improvements in the most challenging scenarios where CoT fails. Ultimately, MVoT establishes new possibilities for complex reasoning tasks where visual thinking can effectively complement verbal reasoning.|Chengzu Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07542)|null|
|**2025-01-13**|**ML Mule: Mobile-Driven Context-Aware Collaborative Learning**|Artificial intelligence has been integrated into nearly every aspect of daily life, powering applications from object detection with computer vision to large language models for writing emails and compact models in smart homes. These machine learning models cater to individual users but are often detached from them, as they are typically stored and processed in centralized data centers. This centralized approach raises privacy concerns, incurs high infrastructure costs, and struggles with personalization. Federated and fully decentralized learning methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they still depend on centralized servers or face slow convergence due to communication constraints. To overcome these challenges, we propose ML Mule, a approach that utilizes individual mobile devices as 'Mules' to train and transport model snapshots as they move through physical spaces, sharing these models with the physical 'Spaces' they inhabit. This method implicitly forms affinity groups among devices associated with users who share particular spaces, enabling collaborative model evolution, and protecting users' privacy. Our approach addresses several major shortcomings of traditional, federated, and fully decentralized learning systems. The proposed framework represents a new class of machine learning methods that are more robust, distributed, and personalized, bringing the field closer to realizing the original vision of intelligent, adaptive, and genuinely context-aware smart environments. The results show that ML Mule converges faster and achieves higher model accuracy compared to other existing methods.|Haoxiang Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07536)|null|

This study evaluates whether LLMs, specifically GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, can infer Big Five personality traits and generate Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10) item scores from user conversations under zero-shot prompting conditions. Our findings reveal that incorporating an intermediate step--prompting for BFI-10 item scores before calculating traits--enhances accuracy and aligns more closely with the gold standard than direct trait inference. This structured approach underscores the importance of leveraging psychological frameworks in improving predictive precision. Additionally, a group comparison based on depressive symptom presence revealed differential model performance. Participants were categorized into two groups: those experiencing at least one depressive symptom and those without symptoms. GPT-4o mini demonstrated heightened sensitivity to depression-related shifts in traits such as Neuroticism and Conscientiousness within the symptom-present group, whereas GPT-4o exhibited strengths in nuanced interpretation across groups. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs to analyze real-world psychological data effectively, offering a valuable foundation for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and psychology.|Jianfeng Zhu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07532)|null|

In addition, various agentic approaches such as SWE-Agent have been proposed to solve bugs in this benchmark. This paper explores the viability of using an agentic approach to address bugs in an enterprise context. To investigate this, we curate an evaluation set of 178 bugs drawn from Google's issue tracking system. This dataset spans both human-reported (78) and machine-reported bugs (100).   To establish a repair performance baseline on this benchmark, we implement Passerine, an agent similar in spirit to SWE-Agent that can work within Google's development environment. We show that with 20 trajectory samples and Gemini 1.5 Pro, Passerine can produce a patch that passes bug tests (i.e., plausible) for 73% of machine-reported and 25.6% of human-reported bugs in our evaluation set. After manual examination, we found that 43% of machine-reported bugs and 17.9% of human-reported bugs have at least one patch that is semantically equivalent to the ground-truth patch.   These results establish a baseline on an industrially relevant benchmark, which as we show, contains bugs drawn from a different distribution -- in terms of language diversity, size, and spread of changes, etc. -- compared to those in the popular SWE-Bench dataset.|Pat Rondon et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07531)|null|

Current approaches either focus on classification accuracy at the expense of interpretability or generate detailed but potentially unreliable reports through image captioning techniques. In this study, we present RadAlign, a novel framework that combines the predictive accuracy of vision-language models (VLMs) with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the radiologist's workflow, RadAlign first employs a specialized VLM to align visual features with key medical concepts, achieving superior disease classification with an average AUC of 0.885 across multiple diseases. These recognized medical conditions, represented as text-based concepts in the aligned visual-language space, are then used to prompt LLM-based report generation. Enhanced by a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism that grounds outputs in similar historical cases, RadAlign delivers superior report quality with a GREEN score of 0.678, outperforming state-of-the-art methods' 0.634.

However, LLMs are sensitive to the position of relevant information within contexts and tend to generate incorrect responses when such information is placed in the middle, known as `Lost in the Middle' phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce a framework that generates consistent outputs for decoder-only models, irrespective of the input context order. Experimental results for three open domain question answering tasks demonstrate position invariance, where the model is not sensitive to input context order, and superior robustness to irrelevent passages compared to prevailing approaches for RAG pipelines.|Philhoon Oh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07523)|null|
|**2025-01-13**|**Exploring and Mitigating Adversarial Manipulation of Voting-Based Leaderboards**|It is now common to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) by having humans manually vote to evaluate model outputs, in contrast to typical benchmarks that evaluate knowledge or skill at some particular task. Chatbot Arena, the most popular benchmark of this type, ranks models by asking users to select the better response between two randomly selected models (without revealing which model was responsible for the generations). These platforms are widely trusted as a fair and accurate measure of LLM capabilities. In this paper, we show that if bot protection and other defenses are not implemented, these voting-based benchmarks are potentially vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. Specifically, we show that an attacker can alter the leaderboard (to promote their favorite model or demote competitors) at the cost of roughly a thousand votes (verified in a simulated, offline version of Chatbot Arena). Our attack consists of two steps: first, we show how an attacker can determine which model was used to generate a given reply with more than $95\%$ accuracy; and then, the attacker can use this information to consistently vote for (or against) a target model. Working with the Chatbot Arena developers, we identify, propose, and implement mitigations to improve the robustness of Chatbot Arena against adversarial manipulation, which, based on our analysis, substantially increases the cost of such attacks. Some of these defenses were present before our collaboration, such as bot protection with Cloudflare, malicious user detection, and rate limiting. Others, including reCAPTCHA and login are being integrated to strengthen the security in Chatbot Arena.|Yangsibo Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07493)|null|
|**2025-01-13**|**TiEBe: A Benchmark for Assessing the Current Knowledge of Large Language Models**|In a rapidly evolving knowledge landscape and the increasing adoption of large language models, a need has emerged to keep these models continuously updated with current events. While existing benchmarks evaluate general factual recall, they often overlook two critical aspects: the ability of models to integrate evolving knowledge through continual learning and the significant regional disparities in their performance. To address these gaps, we introduce the Timely Events Benchmark (TiEBe), a dataset containing over 11,000 question-answer pairs focused on globally and regionally significant events. TiEBe leverages structured retrospective data from Wikipedia, enabling continuous updates to assess LLMs' knowledge of evolving global affairs and their understanding of events across different regions. Our benchmark demonstrates that LLMs exhibit substantial geographic disparities in factual recall, emphasizing the need for more balanced global knowledge representation. Furthermore, TiEBe serves as a tool for evaluating continual learning strategies, providing insights into models' ability to acquire new information without forgetting past knowledge.|Thales Sales Almeida et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07482)|null|
|**2025-01-10**|**LlamaV-o1: Rethinking Step-by-step Visual Reasoning in LLMs**|Reasoning is a fundamental capability for solving complex multi-step problems, particularly in visual contexts where sequential step-wise understanding is essential. Existing approaches lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating visual reasoning and do not emphasize step-wise problem-solving. To this end, we propose a comprehensive framework for advancing step-by-step visual reasoning in large language models (LMMs) through three key contributions. First, we introduce a visual reasoning benchmark specifically designed to evaluate multi-step reasoning tasks. The benchmark presents a diverse set of challenges with eight different categories ranging from complex visual perception to scientific reasoning with over 4k reasoning steps in total, enabling robust evaluation of LLMs' abilities to perform accurate and interpretable visual reasoning across multiple steps. Second, we propose a novel metric that assesses visual reasoning quality at the granularity of individual steps, emphasizing both correctness and logical coherence. The proposed metric offers deeper insights into reasoning performance compared to traditional end-task accuracy metrics. Third, we present a new multimodal visual reasoning model, named LlamaV-o1, trained using a multi-step curriculum learning approach, where tasks are progressively organized to facilitate incremental skill acquisition and problem-solving. The proposed LlamaV-o1 is designed for multi-step reasoning and learns step-by-step through a structured training paradigm. Extensive experiments show that our LlamaV-o1 outperforms existing open-source models and performs favorably against close-source proprietary models. Compared to the recent Llava-CoT, our LlamaV-o1 achieves an average score of 67.3 with an absolute gain of 3.8\% across six benchmarks while being 5 times faster during inference scaling. Our benchmark, model, and code are publicly available.|Omkar Thawakar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06186)|**[link](https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/llamav-o1)**|
|**2025-01-10**|**PEACE: Empowering Geologic Map Holistic Understanding with MLLMs**|Geologic map, as a fundamental diagram in geology science, provides critical insights into the structure and composition of Earth's subsurface and surface. These maps are indispensable in various fields, including disaster detection, resource exploration, and civil engineering. Despite their significance, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often fall short in geologic map understanding. This gap is primarily due to the challenging nature of cartographic generalization, which involves handling high-resolution map, managing multiple associated components, and requiring domain-specific knowledge. To quantify this gap, we construct GeoMap-Bench, the first-ever benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in geologic map understanding, which assesses the full-scale abilities in extracting, referring, grounding, reasoning, and analyzing. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeoMap-Agent, the inaugural agent designed for geologic map understanding, which features three modules: Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI), and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). Inspired by the interdisciplinary collaboration among human scientists, an AI expert group acts as consultants, utilizing a diverse tool pool to comprehensively analyze questions. Through comprehensive experiments, GeoMap-Agent achieves an overall score of 0.811 on GeoMap-Bench, significantly outperforming 0.369 of GPT-4o. Our work, emPowering gEologic mAp holistiC undErstanding (PEACE) with MLLMs, paves the way for advanced AI applications in geology, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of geological investigations.|Yangyu Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06184)|null|
|**2025-01-10**|**Multilingual Performance of a Multimodal Artificial Intelligence System on Multisubject Physics Concept Inventories**|We investigate the multilingual and multimodal performance of a large language model-based artificial intelligence (AI) system, GPT-4o, on a diverse set of physics concept inventories spanning multiple languages and subject areas. The inventories taken from the PhysPort website cover the classical physics topics of mechanics, electromagnetism, optics, and thermodynamics as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, astronomy, mathematics, and laboratory skills. Unlike previous text-only studies, we uploaded the inventories as images mirroring what a student would see on paper, assessing the system's multimodal functionality. The AI is prompted in English and autonomously chooses the language of its response - either remaining in the nominal language of the test, switching entirely to English, or mixing languages - revealing adaptive behavior dependent on linguistic complexity and data availability. Our results indicate some variation in performance across subject areas, with laboratory skills standing out as the area of poorest performance. Furthermore, the AI's performance on questions that require visual interpretation of images is worse than on purely text-based questions. Questions that are difficult for the AI tend to be that way invariably of the inventory language. We also find large variations in performance across languages, with some appearing to benefit substantially from language switching, a phenomenon similar to code-switching ofhuman speakers. Overall, comparing the obtained AI results to the existing literature, we find that the AI system outperforms average undergraduate students post-instruction in all subject areas but laboratory skills.|Gerd Kortemeyer et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06143)|null|
|**2025-01-10**|**Supervision policies can shape long-term risk management in general-purpose AI models**|The rapid proliferation and deployment of General-Purpose AI (GPAI) models, including large language models (LLMs), present unprecedented challenges for AI supervisory entities. We hypothesize that these entities will need to navigate an emergent ecosystem of risk and incident reporting, likely to exceed their supervision capacity. To investigate this, we develop a simulation framework parameterized by features extracted from the diverse landscape of risk, incident, or hazard reporting ecosystems, including community-driven platforms, crowdsourcing initiatives, and expert assessments. We evaluate four supervision policies: non-prioritized (first-come, first-served), random selection, priority-based (addressing the highest-priority risks first), and diversity-prioritized (balancing high-priority risks with comprehensive coverage across risk types). Our results indicate that while priority-based and diversity-prioritized policies are more effective at mitigating high-impact risks, particularly those identified by experts, they may inadvertently neglect systemic issues reported by the broader community. This oversight can create feedback loops that amplify certain types of reporting while discouraging others, leading to a skewed perception of the overall risk landscape. We validate our simulation results with several real-world datasets, including one with over a million ChatGPT interactions, of which more than 150,000 conversations were identified as risky. This validation underscores the complex trade-offs inherent in AI risk supervision and highlights how the choice of risk management policies can shape the future landscape of AI risks across diverse GPAI models used in society.|Manuel Cebrian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06137)|**[link](https://github.com/manuelcebrianramos/llm_supervision_policies)**|

Existing ASR correction methods rely on prior user data or named entities. We extend correction to tasks that have no prior user data and exhibit linguistic flexibility such as lexical and syntactic variations. We propose a novel context augmentation with a large language model and a ranking strategy that incorporates contextual information from the dialogue states of a goal-oriented conversational AI and its tasks. Our method ranks (1) n-best ASR hypotheses by their lexical and semantic similarity with context and (2) context by phonetic correspondence with ASR hypotheses. Evaluated in home improvement and cooking domains with real-world users, our method improves recall and F1 of correction by 34% and 16%, respectively, while maintaining precision and false positive rate. Users rated .8-1 point (out of 5) higher when our correction method worked properly, with no decrease due to false positives.|Yuya Asano et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06129)|null|
|**2025-01-10**|**Fleurs-SLU: A Massively Multilingual Benchmark for Spoken Language Understanding**|While recent multilingual automatic speech recognition models claim to support thousands of languages, ASR for low-resource languages remains highly unreliable due to limited bimodal speech and text training data. Better multilingual spoken language understanding (SLU) can strengthen massively the robustness of multilingual ASR by levering language semantics to compensate for scarce training data, such as disambiguating utterances via context or exploiting semantic similarities across languages. Even more so, SLU is indispensable for inclusive speech technology in roughly half of all living languages that lack a formal writing system. However, the evaluation of multilingual SLU remains limited to shallower tasks such as intent classification or language identification. To address this, we present Fleurs-SLU, a multilingual SLU benchmark that encompasses topical speech classification in 102 languages and multiple-choice question answering through listening comprehension in 92 languages. We extensively evaluate both end-to-end speech classification models and cascaded systems that combine speech-to-text transcription with subsequent classification by large language models on Fleurs-SLU. Our results show that cascaded systems exhibit greater robustness in multilingual SLU tasks, though speech encoders can achieve competitive performance in topical speech classification when appropriately pre-trained. We further find a strong correlation between robust multilingual ASR, effective speech-to-text translation, and strong multilingual SLU, highlighting the mutual benefits between acoustic and semantic speech representations.|Fabian David Schmidt et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06117)|null|
|**2025-01-10**|**From Conversation to Automation: Leveraging Large Language Models to Analyze Strategies in Problem Solving Therapy**|Problem-solving therapy (PST) is a structured psychological approach that helps individuals manage stress and resolve personal issues by guiding them through problem identification, solution brainstorming, decision-making, and outcome evaluation. As mental health care increasingly integrates technologies like chatbots and large language models (LLMs), understanding how PST can be effectively automated is important. This study leverages anonymized therapy transcripts to analyze and classify therapeutic interventions using various LLMs and transformer-based models. Our results show that GPT-4o achieved the highest accuracy (0.76) in identifying PST strategies, outperforming other models. Additionally, we introduced a new dimension of communication strategies that enhances the current PST framework, offering deeper insights into therapist-client interactions. This research demonstrates the potential of LLMs to automate complex therapeutic dialogue analysis, providing a scalable, efficient tool for mental health interventions. Our annotation framework can enhance the accessibility, effectiveness, and personalization of PST, supporting therapists in real-time with more precise, targeted interventions.|Elham Aghakhani et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06101)|null|
|**2025-01-10**|**Addressing speaker gender bias in large scale speech translation systems**|This study addresses the issue of speaker gender bias in Speech Translation (ST) systems, which can lead to offensive and inaccurate translations. The masculine bias often found in large-scale ST systems is typically perpetuated through training data derived from Machine Translation (MT) systems. Our approach involves two key steps. First, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to rectify translations based on the speaker's gender in a cost-effective manner. Second, we fine-tune the ST model with the corrected data, enabling the model to generate gender-specific translations directly from audio cues, without the need for explicit gender input. Additionally, we propose a three-mode fine-tuned model for scenarios where the speaker's gender is either predefined or should not be inferred from speech cues. We demonstrate a 70% improvement in translations for female speakers compared to our baseline and other large-scale ST systems, such as Seamless M4T and Canary, on the MuST-SHE test set.|Shubham Bansal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05989)|null|

Prior work adapted questionnaires through expert reviews and pilot studies, which are resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to automate the questionnaire pretesting process in cross-cultural settings. Our study used LLMs to adapt a U.S.-focused climate opinion survey for a South African audience. We then tested the adapted questionnaire with 116 South African participants via Prolific, asking them to provide feedback on both versions. Participants perceived the LLM-adapted questions as slightly more favorable than the traditional version.

Most existing solutions address this challenge by focusing on aligning the models with credible sources or by improving how models communicate their confidence (or lack thereof) in their outputs. While these measures may be effective in most contexts, they may fall short in scenarios requiring more nuanced approaches, especially in situations where access to accurate data is limited or determining credible sources is challenging. In this study, we take North Korea - a country characterised by an extreme lack of reliable sources and the prevalence of sensationalist falsehoods - as a case study. We explore and evaluate how some of the best-performing multilingual LLMs and specific language-based models generate information about North Korea in three languages spoken in countries with significant geo-political interests: English (United States, United Kingdom), Korean (South Korea), and Mandarin Chinese (China). Our findings reveal significant differences, suggesting that the choice of model and language can lead to vastly different understandings of North Korea, which has important implications given the global security challenges the country poses.|Eunjung Cho et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05981)|null|
|**2025-01-09**|**ReFocus: Visual Editing as a Chain of Thought for Structured Image Understanding**|Structured image understanding, such as interpreting tables and charts, requires strategically refocusing across various structures and texts within an image, forming a reasoning sequence to arrive at the final answer. However, current multimodal large language models (LLMs) lack this multihop selective attention capability. In this work, we introduce ReFocus, a simple yet effective framework that equips multimodal LLMs with the ability to generate "visual thoughts" by performing visual editing on the input image through code, shifting and refining their visual focuses. Specifically, ReFocus enables multimodal LLMs to generate Python codes to call tools and modify the input image, sequentially drawing boxes, highlighting sections, and masking out areas, thereby enhancing the visual reasoning process. We experiment upon a wide range of structured image understanding tasks involving tables and charts. ReFocus largely improves performance on all tasks over GPT-4o without visual editing, yielding an average gain of 11.0% on table tasks and 6.8% on chart tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of the effects of different visual edits, and reasons why ReFocus can improve the performance without introducing additional information. Further, we collect a 14k training set using ReFocus, and prove that such visual chain-of-thought with intermediate information offers a better supervision than standard VQA data, reaching a 8.0% average gain over the same model trained with QA pairs and 2.6% over CoT.|Xingyu Fu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05452)|null|

EMMA: An Enhanced MultiModal ReAsoning Benchmark**|The ability to organically reason over and with both text and images is a pillar of human intelligence, yet the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform such multimodal reasoning remains under-explored. Existing benchmarks often emphasize text-dominant reasoning or rely on shallow visual cues, failing to adequately assess integrated visual and textual reasoning. We introduce EMMA (Enhanced MultiModal reAsoning), a benchmark targeting organic multimodal reasoning across mathematics, physics, chemistry, and coding. EMMA tasks demand advanced cross-modal reasoning that cannot be addressed by reasoning independently in each modality, offering an enhanced test suite for MLLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on EMMA reveals significant limitations in handling complex multimodal and multi-step reasoning tasks, even with advanced techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time compute scaling underperforming. These findings underscore the need for improved multimodal architectures and training paradigms to close the gap between human and model reasoning in multimodality.|Yunzhuo Hao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05444)|null|

This abuse manifests in multiple ways, including hate speech, cyberbullying, emotional abuse, grooming, and sexting. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the different forms of abuse prevalent in social media, with a particular focus on how emerging technologies, such as Language Models (LMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), are reshaping both the detection and generation of abusive content within these networks. We delve into the mechanisms through which social media abuse is perpetuated, exploring the psychological and social impact. Additionally, we examine the dual role of advanced language models-highlighting their potential to enhance automated detection systems for abusive behavior while also acknowledging their capacity to generate harmful content. This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on online safety and ethics, offering insights into the evolving landscape of cyberabuse and the technological innovations that both mitigate and exacerbate it.|Jose A.

We study Weibo, the most popular microblogging site in China, using posts made during the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis. The study period includes the pre-COVID-19 stage, the outbreak stage, and the early stage of epidemic prevention. We use Llama 3 8B, a Large Language Model, to analyze users' sentiments on the platform by classifying them into positive, negative, sarcastic, and neutral categories. Analyzing sentiment shifts on Weibo provides insights into how social events and government actions influence public opinion. This study contributes to understanding the dynamics of social sentiments during health crises, fulfilling a gap in sentiment analysis for Chinese platforms.

However, research on bias in code generation remains limited. Existing studies typically assess bias by applying malicious prompts or reapply tasks and dataset for discriminative models. Given that LLMs are often aligned with human values and that prior datasets are not fully optimized for code-related tasks, there is a pressing need for benchmarks specifically designed for evaluating code models. In this study, we introduce FairCode, a novel benchmark for evaluating bias in code generation. FairCode comprises two tasks: function implementation and test case generation, each evaluating social bias through diverse scenarios. Additionally, we propose a new metric, FairScore, to assess model performance on this benchmark. We conduct experiments on widely used LLMs and provide a comprehensive analysis of the results.

These models, based on foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) - trained on broad data - are tailored to address the demands of physics research. LPMs can function independently or as part of an integrated framework. This framework can incorporate specialized tools, including symbolic reasoning modules for mathematical manipulations, frameworks to analyse specific experimental and simulated data, and mechanisms for synthesizing theories and scientific literature. We begin by examining whether the physics community should actively develop and refine dedicated models, rather than relying solely on commercial LLMs. We then outline how LPMs can be realized through interdisciplinary collaboration among experts in physics, computer science, and philosophy of science. To integrate these models effectively, we identify three key pillars: Development, Evaluation, and Philosophical Reflection. Development focuses on constructing models capable of processing physics texts, mathematical formulations, and diverse physical data. Evaluation assesses accuracy and reliability by testing and benchmarking. Finally, Philosophical Reflection encompasses the analysis of broader implications of LLMs in physics, including their potential to generate new scientific understanding and what novel collaboration dynamics might arise in research. Inspired by the organizational structure of experimental collaborations in particle physics, we propose a similarly interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to building and refining Large Physics Models.

While speculative sampling was previously limited to discrete sequences, we extend it to diffusion models, which generate samples via continuous, vector-valued Markov chains. In this context, the target model is a high-quality but computationally expensive diffusion model. We propose various drafting strategies, including a simple and effective approach that does not require training a draft model and is applicable out of the box to any diffusion model. Our experiments demonstrate significant generation speedup on various diffusion models, halving the number of function evaluations, while generating exact samples from the target model.|Valentin De Bortoli et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05370)|null|

However, their extended reasoning processes often suffer from knowledge insufficiency, leading to frequent uncertainties and potential errors. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{Search-o1}, a framework that enhances LRMs with an agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism and a Reason-in-Documents module for refining retrieved documents. Search-o1 integrates an agentic search workflow into the reasoning process, enabling dynamic retrieval of external knowledge when LRMs encounter uncertain knowledge points. Additionally, due to the verbose nature of retrieved documents, we design a separate Reason-in-Documents module to deeply analyze the retrieved information before injecting it into the reasoning chain, minimizing noise and preserving coherent reasoning flow. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks in science, mathematics, and coding, as well as six open-domain QA benchmarks, demonstrate the strong performance of Search-o1. This approach enhances the trustworthiness and applicability of LRMs in complex reasoning tasks, paving the way for more reliable and versatile intelligent systems.

Current alignment strategies, including adaptive training and inference-time methods, have demonstrated potential in this area. However, these approaches still struggle to balance deployment complexity and capability across various tasks and difficulties. In this work, we introduce the Streaming Distribution Induce Aligner (Stream Aligner), a novel alignment paradigm that combines efficiency with enhanced performance in various tasks throughout the generation process. Stream Aligner achieves dynamic sentence-level correction by using a small model to learn the preferences of the suffix sentence, iteratively correcting the suffix sentence output by the upstream model, and then using the corrected sentence to replace the suffix sentence in subsequent generations. Compared to Aligner, our experiments demonstrate that Stream Aligner reduces reliance on the capabilities of additional models, enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs, and decreases latency during user interaction. Specifically, Stream Aligner-2B model has achieved an improvement of 76.1% in helpfulness, 36.0% in harmlessness on the tested Llama2-70B-chat model, and Stream Aligner-8B has achieved an improvement of 3.5% on the math ability of the tested Llama3-70B-Instruct model.|Hantao Lou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05336)|**[link](https://github.com/htlou/stream-aligner)**|

Interpreters can enhance trust by improving transparency and reducing perceived risk. However, current solutions often lack a human-centric approach to integrating multimodal interpretations. This paper introduces a novel Human-centered Multimodal Interpreter (HMI) system that leverages human preferences to provide visual, textual, and auditory feedback. The system combines a visual interface with Bird's Eye View (BEV), map, and text display, along with voice interaction using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). Our user study, involving diverse participants, demonstrated that the HMI system significantly boosts passenger trust in AVs, increasing average trust levels by over 8%, with trust in ordinary environments rising by up to 30%. These results underscore the potential of the HMI system to improve the acceptance and reliability of autonomous vehicles by providing clear, real-time, and context-sensitive explanations of vehicle actions.|Xuewen Luo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05322)|null|
|**2025-01-08**|**Re-ranking the Context for Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation**|Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge to generate a response within a context with improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations. However, multi-modal RAG systems face unique challenges: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant entries to user query (e.g., images, documents), and (ii) vision-language models or multi-modal language models like GPT-4o may hallucinate when processing these entries to generate RAG output. In this paper, we aim to address the first challenge, i.e, improving the selection of relevant context from the knowledge-base in retrieval phase of the multi-modal RAG. Specifically, we leverage the relevancy score (RS) measure designed in our previous work for evaluating the RAG performance to select more relevant entries in retrieval process. The retrieval based on embeddings, say CLIP-based embedding, and cosine similarity usually perform poorly particularly for multi-modal data. We show that by using a more advanced relevancy measure, one can enhance the retrieval process by selecting more relevant pieces from the knowledge-base and eliminate the irrelevant pieces from the context by adaptively selecting up-to- $k$ entries instead of fixed number of entries. Our evaluation using COCO dataset demonstrates significant enhancement in selecting relevant context and accuracy of the generated response.|Matin Mortaheb et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04695)|null|

However, most existing methods focus on code snippets, which are limited to specific functionalities and rigid structures, restricting the complexity and diversity of the synthesized data. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel feature tree-based synthesis framework inspired by Abstract Syntax Trees (AST). Unlike AST, which captures syntactic structure of code, our framework models semantic relationships between code elements, enabling the generation of more nuanced and diverse data. The feature tree is constructed from raw data and refined iteratively to increase the quantity and diversity of the extracted features. This process enables the identification of more complex patterns and relationships within the code. By sampling subtrees with controlled depth and breadth, our framework allows precise adjustments to the complexity of the generated code, supporting a wide range of tasks from simple function-level operations to intricate multi-file scenarios. We fine-tuned widely-used base models to create the EpiCoder series, achieving state-of-the-art performance at both the function and file levels across multiple benchmarks. Notably, empirical evidence indicates that our approach shows significant potential in synthesizing highly complex repository-level code data. Further analysis elucidates the merits of this approach by rigorously assessing data complexity and diversity through software engineering principles and LLM-as-a-judge method.|Yaoxiang Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04694)|null|

Recently, the introduction of derivative process supervision on CoT trajectories has sparked discussions on enhancing scaling capabilities during test time, thereby boosting the potential of these models. However, in multimodal mathematical reasoning, the scarcity of high-quality CoT training data has hindered existing models from achieving high-precision CoT reasoning and has limited the realization of reasoning potential during test time. In this work, we propose a three-module synthesis strategy that integrates CoT distillation, trajectory-format rewriting, and format unification. It results in a high-quality CoT reasoning instruction fine-tuning dataset in multimodal mathematics, MMathCoT-1M. We comprehensively validate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of the trained URSA-7B model on multiple multimodal mathematical benchmarks. For test-time scaling, we introduce a data synthesis strategy that automatically generates process annotation datasets, known as DualMath-1.1M, focusing on both interpretation and logic. By further training URSA-7B on DualMath-1.1M, we transition from CoT reasoning capabilities to robust supervision abilities. The trained URSA-RM-7B acts as a verifier, effectively enhancing the performance of URSA-7B at test time. URSA-RM-7B also demonstrates excellent out-of-distribution (OOD) verifying capabilities, showcasing its generalization.

The dataset comprises simple, stacked, and grouped bar charts, targeting the unique structural features of these visualizations. The finetuned DEPLOT model is evaluated against its base version using a test set of 1,000 images and two metrics: Relative Mapping Similarity (RMS), which measures categorical mapping accuracy, and Relative Number Set Similarity (RNSS), which evaluates numerical interpretation accuracy. To further explore the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we curate an additional set of 100 bar chart images paired with question answer sets.

|**2025-01-08**|**Are They the Same? Exploring Visual Correspondence Shortcomings of Multimodal LLMs**|Recent advancements in multimodal models have shown a strong ability in visual perception, reasoning abilities, and vision-language understanding. However, studies on visual matching ability are missing, where finding the visual correspondence of objects is essential in vision research. Our research reveals that the matching capabilities in recent multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) still exhibit systematic shortcomings, even with current strong MLLMs models, GPT-4o. In particular, we construct a Multimodal Visual Matching (MMVM) benchmark to fairly benchmark over 30 different MLLMs. The MMVM benchmark is built from 15 open-source datasets and Internet videos with manual annotation. We categorize the data samples of MMVM benchmark into eight aspects based on the required cues and capabilities to more comprehensively evaluate and analyze current MLLMs. In addition, we have designed an automatic annotation pipeline to generate the MMVM SFT dataset, including 220K visual matching data with reasoning annotation. Finally, we present CoLVA, a novel contrastive MLLM with two novel technical designs: fine-grained vision expert with object-level contrastive learning and instruction augmentation strategy. CoLVA achieves 51.06\% overall accuracy (OA) on the MMVM benchmark, surpassing GPT-4o and baseline by 8.41\% and 23.58\% OA, respectively. The results show the effectiveness of our MMVM SFT dataset and our novel technical designs.

|**2025-01-08**|**Assessing Language Comprehension in Large Language Models Using Construction Grammar**|Large Language Models, despite their significant capabilities, are known to fail in surprising and unpredictable ways. Evaluating their true `understanding' of language is particularly challenging due to the extensive web-scale data they are trained on. Therefore, we construct an evaluation to systematically assess natural language understanding (NLU) in LLMs by leveraging Construction Grammar (CxG), which provides insights into the meaning captured by linguistic elements known as constructions (Cxns). CxG is well-suited for this purpose because provides a theoretical basis to construct targeted evaluation sets. These datasets are carefully constructed to include examples which are unlikely to appear in pre-training data, yet intuitive and easy for humans to understand, enabling a more targeted and reliable assessment. Our experiments focus on downstream natural language inference and reasoning tasks by comparing LLMs' understanding of the underlying meanings communicated through 8 unique Cxns with that of humans. The results show that while LLMs demonstrate some knowledge of constructional information, even the latest models including GPT-o1 struggle with abstract meanings conveyed by these Cxns, as demonstrated in cases where test sentences are dissimilar to their pre-training data. We argue that such cases provide a more accurate test of true language understanding, highlighting key limitations in LLMs' semantic capabilities. We make our novel dataset and associated experimental data including prompts and model responses publicly available.|Wesley Scivetti et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04661)|null|

However, when building real-world RAG applications, practical issues arise. First, the retrieved information is generally domain-specific. Since it is computationally expensive to fine-tune LLMs, it is more feasible to fine-tune the retriever to improve the quality of the data included in the LLM input. Second, as more applications are deployed in the same real-world system, one cannot afford to deploy separate retrievers. Moreover, these RAG applications normally retrieve different kinds of data. Our solution is to instruction fine-tune a small retriever encoder on a variety of domain-specific tasks to allow us to deploy one encoder that can serve many use cases, thereby achieving low-cost, scalability, and speed. We show how this encoder generalizes to out-of-domain settings as well as to an unseen retrieval task on real-world enterprise use cases.|Patrice Béchard et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04652)|null|
|**2025-01-08**|**FlairGPT: Repurposing LLMs for Interior Designs**|Interior design involves the careful selection and arrangement of objects to create an aesthetically pleasing, functional, and harmonized space that aligns with the client's design brief. This task is particularly challenging, as a successful design must not only incorporate all the necessary objects in a cohesive style, but also ensure they are arranged in a way that maximizes accessibility, while adhering to a variety of affordability and usage considerations. Data-driven solutions have been proposed, but these are typically room- or domain-specific and lack explainability in their design design considerations used in producing the final layout. In this paper, we investigate if large language models (LLMs) can be directly utilized for interior design. While we find that LLMs are not yet capable of generating complete layouts, they can be effectively leveraged in a structured manner, inspired by the workflow of interior designers. By systematically probing LLMs, we can reliably generate a list of objects along with relevant constraints that guide their placement. We translate this information into a design layout graph, which is then solved using an off-the-shelf constrained optimization setup to generate the final layouts. We benchmark our algorithm in various design configurations against existing LLM-based methods and human designs, and evaluate the results using a variety of quantitative and qualitative metrics along with user studies. In summary, we demonstrate that LLMs, when used in a structured manner, can effectively generate diverse high-quality layouts, making them a viable solution for creating large-scale virtual scenes.

|**2025-01-08**|**Knowledge Retrieval Based on Generative AI**|This study develops a question-answering system based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Chinese Wikipedia and Lawbank as retrieval sources. Using TTQA and TMMLU+ as evaluation datasets, the system employs BGE-M3 for dense vector retrieval to obtain highly relevant search results and BGE-reranker to reorder these results based on query relevance. The most pertinent retrieval outcomes serve as reference knowledge for a Large Language Model (LLM), enhancing its ability to answer questions and establishing a knowledge retrieval system grounded in generative AI.   The system's effectiveness is assessed through a two-stage evaluation: automatic and assisted performance evaluations. The automatic evaluation calculates accuracy by comparing the model's auto-generated labels with ground truth answers, measuring performance under standardized conditions without human intervention. The assisted performance evaluation involves 20 finance-related multiple-choice questions answered by 20 participants without financial backgrounds. Initially, participants answer independently. Later, they receive system-generated reference information to assist in answering, examining whether the system improves accuracy when assistance is provided.   The main contributions of this research are: (1) Enhanced LLM Capability: By integrating BGE-M3 and BGE-reranker, the system retrieves and reorders highly relevant results, reduces hallucinations, and dynamically accesses authorized or public knowledge sources. (2) Improved Data Privacy: A customized RAG architecture enables local operation of the LLM, eliminating the need to send private data to external servers. This approach enhances data security, reduces reliance on commercial services, lowers operational costs, and mitigates privacy risks.|Te-Lun Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04635)|null|
|**2025-01-07**|**Sa2VA: Marrying SAM2 with LLaVA for Dense Grounded Understanding of Images and Videos**|This work presents Sa2VA, the first unified model for dense grounded understanding of both images and videos. Unlike existing multi-modal large language models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks, Sa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referring segmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning. Sa2VA combines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with LLaVA, an advanced vision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLM token space. Using the LLM, Sa2VA generates instruction tokens that guide SAM-2 in producing precise masks, enabling a grounded, multi-modal understanding of both static and dynamic visual content. Additionally, we introduce Ref-SAV, an auto-labeled dataset containing over 72k object expressions in complex video scenes, designed to boost model performance. We also manually validate 2k video objects in the Ref-SAV datasets to benchmark referring video object segmentation in complex environments. Experiments show that Sa2VA achieves state-of-the-art across multiple tasks, particularly in referring video object segmentation, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.|Haobo Yuan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04001)|null|
|**2025-01-07**|**RAG-Check: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Performance**|Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves large language models (LLMs) by using external knowledge to guide response generation, reducing hallucinations. However, RAG, particularly multi-modal RAG, can introduce new hallucination sources: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant pieces (e.g., documents, images) as raw context from the database, and (ii) retrieved images are processed into text-based context via vision-language models (VLMs) or directly used by multi-modal language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o, which may hallucinate. To address this, we propose a novel framework to evaluate the reliability of multi-modal RAG using two performance measures: (i) the relevancy score (RS), assessing the relevance of retrieved entries to the query, and (ii) the correctness score (CS), evaluating the accuracy of the generated response. We train RS and CS models using a ChatGPT-derived database and human evaluator samples. Results show that both models achieve ~88% accuracy on test data. Additionally, we construct a 5000-sample human-annotated database evaluating the relevancy of retrieved pieces and the correctness of response statements. Our RS model aligns with human preferences 20% more often than CLIP in retrieval, and our CS model matches human preferences ~91% of the time. Finally, we assess various RAG systems' selection and generation performances using RS and CS.|Matin Mortaheb et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03995)|null|
|**2025-01-07**|**Influences on LLM Calibration: A Study of Response Agreement, Loss Functions, and Prompt Styles**|Calibration, the alignment between model confidence and prediction accuracy, is critical for the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). Existing works neglect to measure the generalization of their methods to other prompt styles and different sizes of LLMs. To address this, we define a controlled experimental setting covering 12 LLMs and four prompt styles. We additionally investigate if incorporating the response agreement of multiple LLMs and an appropriate loss function can improve calibration performance. Concretely, we build Calib-n, a novel framework that trains an auxiliary model for confidence estimation that aggregates responses from multiple LLMs to capture inter-model agreement. To optimize calibration, we integrate focal and AUC surrogate losses alongside binary cross-entropy. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate that both response agreement and focal loss improve calibration from baselines. We find that few-shot prompts are the most effective for auxiliary model-based methods, and auxiliary models demonstrate robust calibration performance across accuracy variations, outperforming LLMs' internal probabilities and verbalized confidences. These insights deepen the understanding of influence factors in LLM calibration, supporting their reliable deployment in diverse applications.|Yuxi Xia et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03991)|null|

The right to be forgotten (RTBF) allows individuals to request the removal of outdated or harmful information from public access, yet implementing this right poses substantial technical difficulties for search engines. This paper aims to introduce non-experts to the foundational concepts of information retrieval (IR) and de-indexing, which are critical for understanding how search engines can effectively "forget" certain content. We will explore various IR models, including boolean, probabilistic, vector space, and embedding-based approaches, as well as the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing data processing capabilities. By providing this overview, we seek to highlight the complexities involved in balancing individual privacy rights with the operational challenges faced by search engines in managing information visibility.|Salvatore Vilella et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03989)|null|

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interactively generate and edit BTs that address visual conditions, enabling context-aware robot operations in visually complex environments. A key feature of our approach lies in the conditional control through self-prompted visual conditions. Specifically, the VLM generates BTs with visual condition nodes, where conditions are expressed as free-form text. Another VLM process integrates the text into its prompt and evaluates the conditions against real-world images during robot execution. We validated our framework in a real-world cafe scenario, demonstrating both its feasibility and limitations.|Naoki Wake et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03968)|null|
|**2025-01-07**|**Vision Language Models as Values Detectors**|Large Language Models integrating textual and visual inputs have introduced new possibilities for interpreting complex data. Despite their remarkable ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on visual stimuli, the alignment of these models with human perception in identifying relevant elements in images requires further exploration. This paper investigates the alignment between state-of-the-art LLMs and human annotators in detecting elements of relevance within home environment scenarios. We created a set of twelve images depicting various domestic scenarios and enlisted fourteen annotators to identify the key element in each image. We then compared these human responses with outputs from five different LLMs, including GPT-4o and four LLaVA variants. Our findings reveal a varied degree of alignment, with LLaVA 34B showing the highest performance but still scoring low. However, an analysis of the results highlights the models' potential to detect value-laden elements in images, suggesting that with improved training and refined prompts, LLMs could enhance applications in social robotics, assistive technologies, and human-computer interaction by providing deeper insights and more contextually relevant responses.|Giulio Antonio Abbo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03957)|null|
|**2025-01-07**|**Localizing AI: Evaluating Open-Weight Language Models for Languages of Baltic States**|Although large language models (LLMs) have transformed our expectations of modern language technologies, concerns over data privacy often restrict the use of commercially available LLMs hosted outside of EU jurisdictions. This limits their application in governmental, defence, and other data-sensitive sectors. In this work, we evaluate the extent to which locally deployable open-weight LLMs support lesser-spoken languages such as Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian. We examine various size and precision variants of the top-performing multilingual open-weight models, Llama~3, Gemma~2, Phi, and NeMo, on machine translation, multiple-choice question answering, and free-form text generation. The results indicate that while certain models like Gemma~2 perform close to the top commercially available models, many LLMs struggle with these languages. Most surprisingly, however, we find that these models, while showing close to state-of-the-art translation performance, are still prone to lexical hallucinations with errors in at least 1 in 20 words for all open-weight multilingual LLMs.|Jurgita Kapočiūtė-Dzikienė et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03952)|null|
|**2025-01-07**|**Not all tokens are created equal: Perplexity Attention Weighted Networks for AI generated text detection**|The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.|Pablo Miralles-González et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03940)|null|

This study explores the potential of LLMs to revolutionize public transportation management within the context of San Antonio's transit system. Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs in natural language processing and data analysis, we investigate their capabilities to optimize route planning, reduce wait times, and provide personalized travel assistance. By utilizing the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) and other relevant data, this research aims to demonstrate how LLMs can potentially improve resource allocation, elevate passenger satisfaction, and inform data-driven decision-making in transit operations. A comparative analysis of different ChatGPT models was conducted to assess their ability to understand transportation information, retrieve relevant data, and provide comprehensive responses. Findings from this study suggest that while LLMs hold immense promise for public transit, careful engineering and fine-tuning are essential to realizing their full potential.

|**2025-01-07**|**LLaVA-Mini: Efficient Image and Video Large Multimodal Models with One Vision Token**|The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has sparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs. LMM frameworks typically encode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and integrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language models (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens (predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead. Previous efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM backbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token quantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal vision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while preserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision tokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early layers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text tokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to fuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the extreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token. LLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the understanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient manner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token instead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by 77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over 10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory.|Shaolei Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03895)|**[link](https://github.com/ictnlp/llava-mini)**|

However, their potential for improvement is limited by two critical problems within their ICL examples: granularity-mismatch and the ensuing negative-effect noise problem. Specifically, the LLMs are capable of the dividing process yet mostly failed by inaccurate reasoning within a few conquer steps, while the ICL examples retrieved in question-grained sometimes lack relevant steps for a specific challenging reasoning step. Further, this disconnect may hinder the correct reasoning due to its irrelevance. To this end, we focus on improving the reasoning quality within each step and present BoostStep. BoostStep aligns the granularity between the retrieving and reasoning on step grained, and provides highly related ICL examples for each reasoning step with a novel `first-try' strategy. BoostStep provides more relevant examples than the coarse question-grained strategy, enhancing the model reasoning quality within each step steadily. BoostStep is a general and robust reasoning-enhancing method that not only improves standalone reasoning performance but also integrates seamlessly with Monte Carlo Tree Search methods (MCTS) to refine both candidate generation and decision-making. Quantitatively, it improves GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Math-72B by 3.6\% and 2.0\% respectively on various mathematical benchmarks, and 7.5\% gain combined with MCTS.|Beichen Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03226)|**[link](https://github.com/beichenzbc/booststep)**|
|**2025-01-06**|**Dispider: Enabling Video LLMs with Active Real-Time Interaction via Disentangled Perception, Decision, and Reaction**|Active Real-time interaction with video LLMs introduces a new paradigm for human-computer interaction, where the model not only understands user intent but also responds while continuously processing streaming video on the fly. Unlike offline video LLMs, which analyze the entire video before answering questions, active real-time interaction requires three capabilities: 1) Perception: real-time video monitoring and interaction capturing. 2) Decision: raising proactive interaction in proper situations, 3) Reaction: continuous interaction with users. However, inherent conflicts exist among the desired capabilities. The Decision and Reaction require a contrary Perception scale and grain, and the autoregressive decoding blocks the real-time Perception and Decision during the Reaction. To unify the conflicted capabilities within a harmonious system, we present Dispider, a system that disentangles Perception, Decision, and Reaction. Dispider features a lightweight proactive streaming video processing module that tracks the video stream and identifies optimal moments for interaction. Once the interaction is triggered, an asynchronous interaction module provides detailed responses, while the processing module continues to monitor the video in the meantime. Our disentangled and asynchronous design ensures timely, contextually accurate, and computationally efficient responses, making Dispider ideal for active real-time interaction for long-duration video streams. Experiments show that Dispider not only maintains strong performance in conventional video QA tasks, but also significantly surpasses previous online models in streaming scenario responses, thereby validating the effectiveness of our architecture.

In one case, issues arise when students heavily rely on such tools in a manner that can affect the development of their writing or coding skills. Other issues of plagiarism also apply. This study aims to support efforts to detect and identify textual content generated using LLM tools. We hypothesize that LLMs-generated text is detectable by machine learning (ML), and investigate ML models that can recognize and differentiate texts generated by multiple LLMs tools. We leverage several ML and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and utilized Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to understand the important features in attribution. Our method is divided into 1) binary classification to differentiate between human-written and AI-text, and 2) multi classification, to differentiate between human-written text and the text generated by the five different LLM tools (ChatGPT, LLaMA, Google Bard, Claude, and Perplexity). Results show high accuracy in the multi and binary classification. Our model outperformed GPTZero with 98.5\% accuracy to 78.3\%. Notably, GPTZero was unable to recognize about 4.2\% of the observations, but our model was able to recognize the complete test dataset.

The findings promote transparency and accountability, helping educators maintain ethical standards and supporting the responsible integration of AI in education. A key contribution of this work is the generation of the CyberHumanAI dataset, which has 1000 observations, 500 of which are written by humans and the other 500 produced by ChatGPT. We evaluate various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms on the CyberHumanAI dataset comparing human-written and AI-generated content from Large Language Models (LLMs) (i.e., ChatGPT). Results demonstrate that traditional ML algorithms, specifically XGBoost and Random Forest, achieve high performance (83% and 81% accuracies respectively). Results also show that classifying shorter content seems to be more challenging than classifying longer content. Further, using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) we identify discriminative features influencing the ML model's predictions, where human-written content tends to use a practical language (e.g., use and allow). Meanwhile AI-generated text is characterized by more abstract and formal terms (e.g., realm and employ). Finally, a comparative analysis with GPTZero show that our narrowly focused, simple, and fine-tuned model can outperform generalized systems like GPTZero. The proposed model achieved approximately 77.5% accuracy compared to GPTZero's 48.5% accuracy when tasked to classify Pure AI, Pure Human, and mixed class. GPTZero showed a tendency to classify challenging and small-content cases as either mixed or unrecognized while our proposed model showed a more balanced performance across the three classes.|Ayat A.

In our benchmark, each prompt includes a user request and a full document, with a maximum length of 32k tokens, requiring long-form responses. The long-form responses are required to be fully grounded in the provided context document while fulfilling the user request. Models are evaluated using automated judge models in two phases: (1) responses are disqualified if they do not fulfill the user request; (2) they are judged as accurate if the response is fully grounded in the provided document. The automated judge models were comprehensively evaluated against a held-out test-set to pick the best prompt template, and the final factuality score is an aggregate of multiple judge models to mitigate evaluation bias. The FACTS Grounding leaderboard will be actively maintained over time, and contains both public and private splits to allow for external participation while guarding the integrity of the leaderboard.

However, the reverse process, translating code into natural language, termed semantic captioning, has received less attention. This task is becoming increasingly important as LLMs are integrated into platforms for code generation, security analysis, and educational purposes. In this paper, we focus on the captioning of SQL query (SQL2Text) to address the critical need for understanding and explaining SQL queries in an era where LLM-generated code poses potential security risks. We repurpose Text2SQL datasets for SQL2Text by introducing an iterative ICL prompt using GPT-4o to generate multiple additional utterances, which enhances the robustness of the datasets for the reverse task. We conduct our experiments using in-context learning (ICL) based on different sample selection methods, emphasizing smaller, more computationally efficient LLMs. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging the inherent graph properties of SQL for ICL sample selection significantly outperforms random selection by up to 39% on BLEU score and provides better results than alternative methods.

|**2025-01-06**|**Large language models for artificial general intelligence (AGI): A survey of foundational principles and approaches**|Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on large-scale pretrained foundation models (PFMs) such as vision-language models, large language models (LLMs), diffusion models and vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated the ability to solve complex and truly non-trivial AI problems in a wide variety of domains and contexts. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), in particular, learn from vast and diverse data sources, allowing rich and nuanced representations of the world and, thereby, providing extensive capabilities, including the ability to reason, engage in meaningful dialog; collaborate with humans and other agents to jointly solve complex problems; and understand social and emotional aspects of humans. Despite this impressive feat, the cognitive abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs trained on large-scale datasets are still superficial and brittle. Consequently, generic LLMs are severely limited in their generalist capabilities. A number of foundational problems -- embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory -- are required to be addressed for LLMs to attain human-level general intelligence. These concepts are more aligned with human cognition and provide LLMs with inherent human-like cognitive properties that support the realization of physically-plausible, semantically meaningful, flexible and more generalizable knowledge and intelligence. In this work, we discuss the aforementioned foundational issues and survey state-of-the art approaches for implementing these concepts in LLMs. Specifically, we discuss how the principles of embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory can be leveraged toward the attainment of artificial general intelligence (AGI) in an organic manner.|Alhassan Mumuni et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03151)|null|

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in simulating diverse personas to create these training scenarios. However, little is known about how LLMs can be developed to simulate victims for scenario-based training purposes. In this paper, we introduce VicSim (victim simulator), a novel model that addresses three key dimensions of user simulation: informational faithfulness, emotional dynamics, and language style (e.g., grammar usage). We pioneer the integration of scenario-based victim modeling with GAN-based training workflow and key-information-based prompting, aiming to enhance the realism of simulated victims. Our adversarial training approach teaches the discriminator to recognize grammar and emotional cues as reliable indicators of synthetic content. According to evaluations by human raters, the VicSim model outperforms GPT-4 in terms of human-likeness.|Yerong Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03139)|null|
|**2025-01-06**|**PRMBench: A Fine-grained and Challenging Benchmark for Process-Level Reward Models**|Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for complex reasoning and decision-making tasks, where each intermediate step plays an important role in the reasoning process. Since language models are prone to various types of errors during the reasoning process, PRMs are required to possess nuanced capabilities for detecting various implicit error types in real-world scenarios. However, current benchmarks primarily focus on step correctness, failing to evaluate PRMs' performance systematically. To address this gap, we introduce PRMBench, a process-level benchmark specifically designed to assess the fine-grained error detection capabilities of PRMs. PRMBench comprises 6,216 carefully designed problems and 83,456 step-level labels, evaluating models across multiple dimensions, including simplicity, soundness, and sensitivity. In our experiments on 15 models, spanning both open-source PRMs and closed-source large language models prompted as critic models, we uncover significant weaknesses in current PRMs. These findings underscore the challenges inherent in process-level evaluation and highlight key directions for future research. We hope PRMBench can be a robust bench for advancing research on PRM evaluation and development.|Mingyang Song et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03124)|**[link](https://github.com/ssmisya/PRMBench)**|

However, speech plays a crucial role in multimodal dialogue systems, and implementing high-performance in both vision and speech tasks remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental modality differences. In this paper, we propose a carefully designed multi-stage training methodology that progressively trains LLM to understand both visual and speech information, ultimately enabling fluent vision and speech interaction. Our approach not only preserves strong vision-language capacity, but also enables efficient speech-to-speech dialogue capabilities without separate ASR and TTS modules, significantly accelerating multimodal end-to-end response speed. By comparing our method against state-of-the-art counterparts across benchmarks for image, video, and speech tasks, we demonstrate that our model is equipped with both strong visual and speech capabilities, making near real-time vision and speech interaction.|Chaoyou Fu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01957)|**[link](https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/VITA)**|

Due to the diversification of internet platforms and the exponential growth of users and items, the importance of cold-start recommendation (CSR) is becoming increasingly evident. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success and possess strong capabilities in modeling user and item information, providing new potential for cold-start recommendations. However, the research community on CSR still lacks a comprehensive review and reflection in this field. Based on this, in this paper, we stand in the context of the era of large language models and provide a comprehensive review and discussion on the roadmap, related literature, and future directions of CSR. Specifically, we have conducted an exploration of the development path of how existing CSR utilizes information, from content features, graph relations, and domain information, to the world knowledge possessed by large language models, aiming to provide new insights for both the research and industrial communities on CSR.

|**2025-01-03**|**Virgo: A Preliminary Exploration on Reproducing o1-like MLLM**|Recently, slow-thinking reasoning systems, built upon large language models (LLMs), have garnered widespread attention by scaling the thinking time during inference. There is also growing interest in adapting this capability to multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Given that MLLMs handle more complex data semantics across different modalities, it is intuitively more challenging to implement multimodal slow-thinking systems.   To address this issue, in this paper, we explore a straightforward approach by fine-tuning a capable MLLM with a small amount of textual long-form thought data, resulting in a multimodal slow-thinking system, Virgo (Visual reasoning with long thought). We find that these long-form reasoning processes, expressed in natural language, can be effectively transferred to MLLMs. Moreover, it seems that such textual reasoning data can be even more effective than visual reasoning data in eliciting the slow-thinking capacities of MLLMs. While this work is preliminary, it demonstrates that slow-thinking capacities are fundamentally associated with the language model component, which can be transferred across modalities or domains. This finding can be leveraged to guide the development of more powerful slow-thinking reasoning systems.

|**2025-01-03**|**Turning Logic Against Itself : Probing Model Defenses Through Contrastive Questions**|Despite significant efforts to align large language models with human values and ethical guidelines, these models remain susceptible to sophisticated jailbreak attacks that exploit their reasoning capabilities. Traditional safety mechanisms often focus on detecting explicit malicious intent, leaving deeper vulnerabilities unaddressed. In this work, we introduce a jailbreak technique, POATE (Polar Opposite query generation, Adversarial Template construction, and Elaboration), which leverages contrastive reasoning to elicit unethical responses. POATE generates prompts with semantically opposite intents and combines them with adversarial templates to subtly direct models toward producing harmful responses. We conduct extensive evaluations across six diverse language model families of varying parameter sizes, including LLaMA3, Gemma2, Phi3, and GPT-4, to demonstrate the robustness of the attack, achieving significantly higher attack success rates (~44%) compared to existing methods. We evaluate our proposed attack against seven safety defenses, revealing their limitations in addressing reasoning-based vulnerabilities. To counteract this, we propose a defense strategy that improves reasoning robustness through chain-of-thought prompting and reverse thinking, mitigating reasoning-driven adversarial exploits.|Rachneet Sachdeva et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01872)|null|
|**2025-01-03**|**Multi-Agent Conversational Online Learning for Adaptive LLM Response Identification**|The remarkable generative capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically generating responses for different applications. Given the dynamic nature of user preferences and the uncertainty of LLM response performance, it is crucial to design efficient online learning algorithms to identify optimal LLM responses (i.e., high-quality responses that also meet user preferences). Most existing online algorithms adopt a centralized approach and fail to leverage explicit user preferences for more efficient and personalized LLM response identification. In contrast, this paper introduces \textit{MACO} (\underline{M}ulti-\underline{A}gent \underline{C}onversational \underline{O}nline Learning for Adaptive LLM Response Identification): 1) The online LLM response identification process is accelerated by multiple local agents (such as smartphones), while enhancing data privacy; 2) A novel conversational mechanism is proposed to adaptively conduct conversations for soliciting user preferences (e.g., a preference for a humorous tone over a serious one in generated responses), so to minimize uncertainty in preference estimation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that \cadi\ is near-optimal regarding cumulative regret. Additionally, \cadi\ offers reduced communication costs and computational complexity by eliminating the traditional, computing-intensive ``G-optimal design" found in previous works. Extensive experiments with the open LLM \textit{Llama}, coupled with two different embedding models from Google and OpenAI for text vector representation, demonstrate that \cadi\ significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in online LLM response identification.|Xiangxiang Dai et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01849)|null|
|**2025-01-03**|**MoColl: Agent-Based Specific and General Model Collaboration for Image Captioning**|Image captioning is a critical task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications across various domains. For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we called \textbf{MoColl}, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond its role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to enhance its domain-specific capabilities. Experimental results on radiology report generation validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of generated reports.|Pu Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01834)|null|
|**2025-01-03**|**Time Series Language Model for Descriptive Caption Generation**|The automatic generation of representative natural language descriptions for observable patterns in time series data enhances interpretability, simplifies analysis and increases cross-domain utility of temporal data. While pre-trained foundation models have made considerable progress in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), their application to time series analysis has been hindered by data scarcity. Although several large language model (LLM)-based methods have been proposed for time series forecasting, time series captioning is under-explored in the context of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce TSLM, a novel time series language model designed specifically for time series captioning. TSLM operates as an encoder-decoder model, leveraging both text prompts and time series data representations to capture subtle temporal patterns across multiple phases and generate precise textual descriptions of time series inputs. TSLM addresses the data scarcity problem in time series captioning by first leveraging an in-context prompting synthetic data generation, and second denoising the generated data via a novel cross-modal dense retrieval scoring applied to time series-caption pairs. Experimental findings on various time series captioning datasets demonstrate that TSLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches from multiple data modalities by a significant margin.|Mohamed Trabelsi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01832)|null|

However, most existing methods focus on isolated safety flaws, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic defenses and uncover complex vulnerabilities efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose Auto-RT, a reinforcement learning framework that automatically explores and optimizes complex attack strategies to effectively uncover security vulnerabilities through malicious queries. Specifically, we introduce two key mechanisms to reduce exploration complexity and improve strategy optimization: 1) Early-terminated Exploration, which accelerate exploration by focusing on high-potential attack strategies; and 2) Progressive Reward Tracking algorithm with intermediate downgrade models, which dynamically refine the search trajectory toward successful vulnerability exploitation. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs demonstrate that, by significantly improving exploration efficiency and automatically optimizing attack strategies, Auto-RT detects a boarder range of vulnerabilities, achieving a faster detection speed and 16.63\% higher success rates compared to existing methods.|Yanjiang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01830)|null|
|**2025-01-03**|**SDPO: Segment-Level Direct Preference Optimization for Social Agents**|Social agents powered by large language models (LLMs) can simulate human social behaviors but fall short in handling complex goal-oriented social dialogues. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has proven effective in aligning LLM behavior with human preferences across a variety of agent tasks. Existing DPO-based approaches for multi-turn interactions are divided into turn-level and session-level methods. The turn-level method is overly fine-grained, focusing exclusively on individual turns, while session-level methods are too coarse-grained, often introducing training noise. To address these limitations, we propose Segment-Level Direct Preference Optimization (SDPO), which focuses on specific key segments within interactions to optimize multi-turn agent behavior while minimizing training noise. Evaluations on the SOTOPIA benchmark demonstrate that SDPO-tuned agents consistently outperform both existing DPO-based methods and proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o, underscoring SDPO's potential to advance the social intelligence of LLM-based agents.

|**2025-01-03**|**Rerouting LLM Routers**|LLM routers aim to balance quality and cost of generation by classifying queries and routing them to a cheaper or more expensive LLM depending on their complexity. Routers represent one type of what we call LLM control planes: systems that orchestrate use of one or more LLMs. In this paper, we investigate routers' adversarial robustness.   We first define LLM control plane integrity, i.e., robustness of LLM orchestration to adversarial inputs, as a distinct problem in AI safety. Next, we demonstrate that an adversary can generate query-independent token sequences we call ``confounder gadgets'' that, when added to any query, cause LLM routers to send the query to a strong LLM.   Our quantitative evaluation shows that this attack is successful both in white-box and black-box settings against a variety of open-source and commercial routers, and that confounding queries do not affect the quality of LLM responses. Finally, we demonstrate that gadgets can be effective while maintaining low perplexity, thus perplexity-based filtering is not an effective defense. We finish by investigating alternative defenses.|Avital Shafran et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01818)|null|
|**2025-01-02**|**Unifying Specialized Visual Encoders for Video Language Models**|The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered sophisticated reasoning capabilities into the realm of video through Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). However, VideoLLMs currently rely on a single vision encoder for all of their visual processing, which limits the amount and type of visual information that can be conveyed to the LLM. Our method, MERV, Multi-Encoder Representation of Videos, instead leverages multiple frozen visual encoders to create a unified representation of a video, providing the VideoLLM with a comprehensive set of specialized visual knowledge. Spatio-temporally aligning the features from each encoder allows us to tackle a wider range of open-ended and multiple-choice video understanding questions and outperform prior state-of-the-art works. MERV is up to 3.7% better in accuracy than Video-LLaVA across the standard suite video understanding benchmarks, while also having a better Video-ChatGPT score. We also improve upon SeViLA, the previous best on zero-shot Perception Test accuracy, by 2.2%. MERV introduces minimal extra parameters and trains faster than equivalent single-encoder methods while parallelizing the visual processing. Finally, we provide qualitative evidence that MERV successfully captures domain knowledge from each of its encoders. Our results offer promising directions in utilizing multiple vision encoders for comprehensive video understanding.|Jihoon Chung et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01426)|null|

However, these systems still struggle to handle the full complexity of real-world conversations, including audio events, musical contexts, and emotional expressions, mainly because current dialogue datasets are constrained in both scale and scenario diversity. In this paper, we propose leveraging synthetic data to enhance the dialogue models across diverse scenarios. We introduce ShareChatX, the first comprehensive, large-scale dataset for spoken dialogue that spans diverse scenarios. Based on this dataset, we introduce OmniChat, a multi-turn dialogue system with a heterogeneous feature fusion module, designed to optimize feature selection in different dialogue contexts. In addition, we explored critical aspects of training dialogue systems using synthetic data. Through comprehensive experimentation, we determined the ideal balance between synthetic and real data, achieving state-of-the-art results on the real-world dialogue dataset DailyTalk. We also highlight the crucial importance of synthetic data in tackling diverse, complex dialogue scenarios, especially those involving audio and music.

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.|Austin T.

|**2025-01-02**|**Aligning Large Language Models for Faithful Integrity Against Opposing Argument**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, they can be easily misled by unfaithful arguments during conversations, even when their original statements are correct. To this end, we investigate the problem of maintaining faithful integrity in LLMs. This involves ensuring that LLMs adhere to their faithful statements in the face of opposing arguments and are able to correct their incorrect statements when presented with faithful arguments. In this work, we propose a novel framework, named Alignment for Faithful Integrity with Confidence Estimation (AFICE), which aims to align the LLM responses with faithful integrity. Specifically, AFICE first designs a Bilateral Confidence Estimation (BCE) approach for estimating the uncertainty of each response generated by the LLM given a specific context, which simultaneously estimate the model's confidence to the question based on the internal states during decoding as well as to the answer based on cumulative probability ratios. With the BCE, we construct a conversational preference dataset composed of context, original statement, and argument, which is adopted for aligning the LLM for faithful integrity using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experimental results on a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in the LLM's ability to maintain faithful responses when encountering opposing arguments, ensuring both the practical utility and trustworthiness of LLMs in complex interactive settings.

|**2025-01-02**|**CySecBench: Generative AI-based CyberSecurity-focused Prompt Dataset for Benchmarking Large Language Models**|Numerous studies have investigated methods for jailbreaking Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful content. Typically, these methods are evaluated using datasets of malicious prompts designed to bypass security policies established by LLM providers. However, the generally broad scope and open-ended nature of existing datasets can complicate the assessment of jailbreaking effectiveness, particularly in specific domains, notably cybersecurity. To address this issue, we present and publicly release CySecBench, a comprehensive dataset containing 12662 prompts specifically designed to evaluate jailbreaking techniques in the cybersecurity domain. The dataset is organized into 10 distinct attack-type categories, featuring close-ended prompts to enable a more consistent and accurate assessment of jailbreaking attempts. Furthermore, we detail our methodology for dataset generation and filtration, which can be adapted to create similar datasets in other domains. To demonstrate the utility of CySecBench, we propose and evaluate a jailbreaking approach based on prompt obfuscation. Our experimental results show that this method successfully elicits harmful content from commercial black-box LLMs, achieving Success Rates (SRs) of 65% with ChatGPT and 88% with Gemini; in contrast, Claude demonstrated greater resilience with a jailbreaking SR of 17%. Compared to existing benchmark approaches, our method shows superior performance, highlighting the value of domain-specific evaluation datasets for assessing LLM security measures. Moreover, when evaluated using prompts from a widely used dataset (i.e., AdvBench), it achieved an SR of 78.5%, higher than the state-of-the-art methods.|Johan Wahréus et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01335)|null|

This paper introduces a novel framework, K-(CSA)^2, which categorizes LLM knowledge along two dimensions: correctness and confidence. The framework defines six categories of knowledge, ranging from highly confident correctness to confidently held misconceptions, enabling a nuanced evaluation of model comprehension beyond binary accuracy. Using this framework, we demonstrate how techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and reinforcement learning with human feedback fundamentally alter the knowledge structures of internal (pre-trained) and external (context-dependent) knowledge in LLMs. CoT particularly enhances base model performance and shows synergistic benefits when applied to aligned LLMs. Moreover, our layer-wise analysis reveals that higher layers in LLMs encode more high-confidence knowledge, while low-confidence knowledge tends to emerge in middle-to-lower layers.|Yanbo Fang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01332)|null|
|**2025-01-02**|**The Prompt Alchemist: Automated LLM-Tailored Prompt Optimization for Test Case Generation**|Test cases are essential for validating the reliability and quality of software applications. Recent studies have demonstrated the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate useful test cases for given source code. However, the existing work primarily relies on human-written plain prompts, which often leads to suboptimal results since the performance of LLMs can be highly influenced by the prompts. Moreover, these approaches use the same prompt for all LLMs, overlooking the fact that different LLMs might be best suited to different prompts. Given the wide variety of possible prompt formulations, automatically discovering the optimal prompt for each LLM presents a significant challenge. Although there are methods on automated prompt optimization in the natural language processing field, they are hard to produce effective prompts for the test case generation task. First, the methods iteratively optimize prompts by simply combining and mutating existing ones without proper guidance, resulting in prompts that lack diversity and tend to repeat the same errors in the generated test cases. Second, the prompts are generally lack of domain contextual knowledge, limiting LLMs' performance in the task.|Shuzheng Gao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01329)|null|
|**2025-01-02**|**Learning Spectral Methods by Transformers**|Transformers demonstrate significant advantages as the building block of modern LLMs. In this work, we study the capacities of Transformers in performing unsupervised learning. We show that multi-layered Transformers, given a sufficiently large set of pre-training instances, are able to learn the algorithms themselves and perform statistical estimation tasks given new instances. This learning paradigm is distinct from the in-context learning setup and is similar to the learning procedure of human brains where skills are learned through past experience. Theoretically, we prove that pre-trained Transformers can learn the spectral methods and use the classification of bi-class Gaussian mixture model as an example. Our proof is constructive using algorithmic design techniques. Our results are built upon the similarities of multi-layered Transformer architecture with the iterative recovery algorithms used in practice. Empirically, we verify the strong capacity of the multi-layered (pre-trained) Transformer on unsupervised learning through the lens of both the PCA and the Clustering tasks performed on the synthetic and real-world datasets.|Yihan He et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01312)|null|

Typical text generation approaches adopt an auto-regressive generation without deliberate reasoning, which often results in untrustworthy and factually inaccurate responses. In this paper, we propose HaluSearch, a novel framework that incorporates tree search-based algorithms (e.g. MCTS) to enable an explicit slow thinking generation process for mitigating hallucinations of LLMs during inference. Specifically, HaluSearch frames text generation as a step-by-step reasoning process, using a self-evaluation reward model to score each generation step and guide the tree search towards the most reliable generation pathway for fully exploiting the internal knowledge of LLMs. To balance efficiency and quality, we introduce a hierarchical thinking system switch mechanism inspired by the dual process theory in cognitive science, which dynamically alternates between fast and slow thinking modes at both the instance and step levels, adapting to the complexity of questions and reasoning states. We conduct extensive experiments on both English and Chinese datasets and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline approaches.|Xiaoxue Cheng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01306)|null|

For LLMs to be effective in supporting diagnostic assessments, it is essential that they closely replicate the standard diagnostic procedures used by clinicians. In this paper, we specifically examine the diagnostic assessment processes described in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for major depressive disorder (MDD) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). We investigate various prompting and fine-tuning techniques to guide both proprietary and open-source LLMs in adhering to these processes, and we evaluate the agreement between LLM-generated diagnostic outcomes and expert-validated ground truth. For fine-tuning, we utilize the Mentalllama and Llama models, while for prompting, we experiment with proprietary models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as llama-3.1-8b and mixtral-8x7b.|Kaushik Roy et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01305)|null|
|**2024-12-30**|**Distributed Mixture-of-Agents for Edge Inference with Large Language Models**|Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) has recently been proposed as a method to enhance performance of large language models (LLMs), enabling multiple individual LLMs to work together for collaborative inference. This collaborative approach results in improved responses to user prompts compared to relying on a single LLM. In this paper, we consider such an MoA architecture in a distributed setting, where LLMs operate on individual edge devices, each uniquely associated with a user and equipped with its own distributed computing power. These devices exchange information using decentralized gossip algorithms, allowing different device nodes to talk without the supervision of a centralized server. In the considered setup, different users have their own LLM models to address user prompts. Additionally, the devices gossip either their own user-specific prompts or augmented prompts to generate more refined answers to certain queries. User prompts are temporarily stored in the device queues when their corresponding LLMs are busy. Given the memory limitations of edge devices, it is crucial to ensure that the average queue sizes in the system remain bounded. In this paper, we address this by theoretically calculating the queuing stability conditions for the device queues under reasonable assumptions, which we validate experimentally as well. Further, we demonstrate through experiments, leveraging open-source LLMs for the implementation of distributed MoA, that certain MoA configurations produce higher-quality responses compared to others, as evaluated on AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark.

They must solve the base problem and then utilize its solution to address the more complex one. This work features three key contributions. First, we propose a general recipe for generating more challenging versions of existing benchmarks, resulting in three new benchmarks: HumanEval Pro, MBPP Pro, and BigCodeBench-Lite Pro, specifically designed to assess LLMs on self-invoking code generation. Second, from the analysis of experimental results over twenty LLMs on our benchmarks, we have two important observations: (i) Most LLMs excel in traditional code generation benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP, but their performance declines on self-invoking tasks. For example, o1-mini achieves 96.2% pass@1 on HumanEval but only 76.2% on HumanEval Pro. (ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned models demonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models. Third, we disclose the types of failure modes that exist in our evaluation results. All these results underscore the need for further advancements in self-invoking code generation tasks and provide a new direction for future research on enhancing LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.|Zhaojian Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21199)|**[link](https://github.com/CodeEval-Pro/CodeEval-Pro)**|

This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the prevalent issue of overthinking in these models, where excessive computational resources are allocated for simple problems with minimal benefit. We introduce novel efficiency metrics from both outcome and process perspectives to evaluate the rational use of computational resources by o1-like models. Using a self-training paradigm, we propose strategies to mitigate overthinking, streamlining reasoning processes without compromising accuracy.

This is particularly true in science, where tasks require many cycles of analysis, tool use, and experimentation. Language agents are promising for automating intellectual tasks in science because they can interact with tools via natural language or code. Yet their flexibility creates conceptual and practical challenges for software implementations, since agents may comprise non-standard components such as internal reasoning, planning, tool usage, as well as the inherent stochasticity of temperature-sampled language models. Here, we introduce Aviary, an extensible gymnasium for language agents. We formalize agents as policies solving language-grounded partially observable Markov decision processes, which we term language decision processes. We then implement five environments, including three challenging scientific environments: (1) manipulating DNA constructs for molecular cloning, (2) answering research questions by accessing scientific literature, and (3) engineering protein stability. These environments were selected for their focus on multi-step reasoning and their relevance to contemporary biology research. Finally, with online training and scaling inference-time compute, we show that language agents backed by open-source, non-frontier LLMs can match and exceed both frontier LLM agents and human experts on multiple tasks at up to 100x lower inference cost.|Siddharth Narayanan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21154)|null|
|**2024-12-30**|**Facilitating large language model Russian adaptation with Learned Embedding Propagation**|Rapid advancements of large language model (LLM) technologies led to the introduction of powerful open-source instruction-tuned LLMs that have the same text generation quality as the state-of-the-art counterparts such as GPT-4. While the emergence of such models accelerates the adoption of LLM technologies in sensitive-information environments the authors of such models don not disclose the training data necessary for replication of the results thus making the achievements model-exclusive. Since those open-source models are also multilingual this in turn reduces the benefits of training a language specific LLMs as improved inference computation efficiency becomes the only guaranteed advantage of such costly procedure. More cost-efficient options such as vocabulary extension and subsequent continued pre-training are also inhibited by the lack of access to high-quality instruction-tuning data since it is the major factor behind the resulting LLM task-solving capabilities. To address the limitations and cut the costs of the language adaptation pipeline we propose Learned Embedding Propagation (LEP). Unlike existing approaches our method has lower training data size requirements due to minimal impact on existing LLM knowledge which we reinforce using novel ad-hoc embedding propagation procedure that allows to skip the instruction-tuning step and instead implant the new language knowledge directly into any existing instruct-tuned variant. We evaluated four Russian vocabulary adaptations for LLaMa-3-8B and Mistral-7B, showing that LEP is competitive with traditional instruction-tuning methods, achieving performance comparable to OpenChat 3.5 and LLaMa-3-8B-Instruct, with further improvements via self-calibration and continued tuning enhancing task-solving capabilities.|Mikhail Tikhomirov et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21140)|**[link](https://github.com/RefalMachine/llmtf_open)**|

Despite regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data owners still have limited control over the use of their content in model training. To address this, we propose ExpShield, a proactive self-guard mechanism that empowers content owners to embed invisible perturbations into their text, limiting data misuse in LLMs training without affecting readability. This preemptive approach enables data owners to protect sensitive content directly, without relying on a third-party to perform defense. Starting from the random perturbation, we demonstrate the rationale for using perturbation to conceal protected content. We further enhance the efficiency by identifying memorization triggers and creating pitfalls to diverge the model memorization in a more focused way. To validate our defense's effectiveness, we propose a novel metric of instance exploitation which captures the individual risk raised by model training. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach as the MIA AUC decreases from 0.95 to 0.55, and instance exploitation approaches zero. This suggests that the individual risk does not increase after training, underscoring the significance of proactive defenses in protecting copyrighted data.|Ruixuan Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21123)|null|
|**2024-12-30**|**Exploring and Controlling Diversity in LLM-Agent Conversation**|Diversity is a critical aspect of multi-agent communication. In this paper, we focus on controlling and exploring diversity in the context of open-domain multi-agent conversations, particularly for world simulation applications. We propose Adaptive Prompt Pruning (APP), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the content of the utterance generation prompt to control diversity using a single parameter, lambda. Through extensive experiments, we show that APP effectively controls the output diversity across models and datasets, with pruning more information leading to more diverse output. We comprehensively analyze the relationship between prompt content and conversational diversity. Our findings reveal that information from all components of the prompt generally constrains the diversity of the output, with the Memory block exerting the most significant influence. APP is compatible with established techniques like temperature sampling and top-p sampling, providing a versatile tool for diversity management. To address the trade-offs of increased diversity, such as inconsistencies with omitted information, we incorporate a post-generation correction step, which effectively balances diversity enhancement with output consistency. Additionally, we examine how prompt structure, including component order and length, impacts diversity. This study addresses key questions surrounding diversity in multi-agent world simulation, offering insights into its control, influencing factors, and associated trade-offs. Our contributions lay the foundation for systematically engineering diversity in LLM-based multi-agent collaborations, advancing their effectiveness in real-world applications.|KuanChao Chu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21102)|null|

However, the diversity and complexity of different components pose a significant challenge to cloud security, especially when dealing with sophisticated and advanced cyberattacks. Recent advancements in generative foundation models (GFMs), particularly in the large language models (LLMs), offer promising solutions for security intelligence. By exploiting the powerful abilities in language understanding, data analysis, task inference, action planning, and code generation, we present LLM-PD, a novel proactive defense architecture that defeats various threats in a proactive manner.

A key challenge in aligning TTA models lies in the difficulty of creating preference pairs, as TTA lacks structured mechanisms like verifiable rewards or gold-standard answers available for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose CLAP-Ranked Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that iteratively generates and optimizes preference data to enhance TTA alignment. We demonstrate that the audio preference dataset generated using CRPO outperforms existing alternatives. With this framework, TangoFlux achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective benchmarks.

While existing benchmarks evaluate these models in context-rich, real-life scenarios, they often overlook fundamental perceptual skills essential for environments deviating from everyday realism. In particular, geometric perception, the ability to interpret spatial relationships and abstract visual patterns, remains underexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce GePBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess the geometric perception capabilities of MLLMs. Results from extensive evaluations reveal that current state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in such tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that models trained with data sourced from GePBench show notable improvements on a wide range of downstream tasks, underscoring the importance of geometric perception as a foundation for advanced multimodal applications.

Trained on vast datasets, these sophisticated AI systems exhibit impressive natural language processing and content generation capabilities. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to address key challenges in personal finance, focusing on the United States. We evaluate several leading LLMs, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Llama, to assess their effectiveness in providing accurate financial advice on topics such as mortgages, taxes, loans, and investments. Our findings show that while these models achieve an average accuracy rate of approximately 70%, they also display notable limitations in certain areas. Specifically, LLMs struggle to provide accurate responses for complex financial queries, with performance varying significantly across different topics. Despite these limitations, the analysis reveals notable improvements in newer versions of these models, highlighting their growing utility for individuals and financial advisors.

|**2024-12-27**|**Fortran2CPP: Automating Fortran-to-C++ Migration using LLMs via Multi-Turn Dialogue and Dual-Agent Integration**|Migrating Fortran code to C++ is a common task for many scientific computing teams, driven by the need to leverage modern programming paradigms, enhance cross-platform compatibility, and improve maintainability. Automating this translation process using large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, but the lack of high-quality, specialized datasets has hindered their effectiveness. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel multi-turn dialogue dataset, Fortran2CPP, specifically designed for Fortran-to-C++ code migration. Our dataset, significantly larger than existing alternatives, is generated using a unique LLM-driven, dual-agent pipeline incorporating iterative compilation, execution, and code repair to ensure high quality and functional correctness. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset, we fine-tuned several open-weight LLMs on Fortran2CPP and evaluated their performance on two independent benchmarks. Fine-tuning on our dataset led to remarkable gains, with models achieving up to a 3.31x increase in CodeBLEU score and a 92\% improvement in compilation success rate. This highlights the dataset's ability to enhance both the syntactic accuracy and compilability of the translated C++ code.

|**2024-12-27**|**Can Large Language Models Adapt to Other Agents In-Context?**|As the research community aims to build better AI assistants that are more dynamic and personalized to the diversity of humans that they interact with, there is increased interest in evaluating the theory of mind capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Indeed, several recent studies suggest that LLM theory of mind capabilities are quite impressive, approximating human-level performance. Our paper aims to rebuke this narrative and argues instead that past studies were not directly measuring agent performance, potentially leading to findings that are illusory in nature as a result. We draw a strong distinction between what we call literal theory of mind i.e. measuring the agent's ability to predict the behavior of others and functional theory of mind i.e. adapting to agents in-context based on a rational response to predictions of their behavior. We find that top performing open source LLMs may display strong capabilities in literal theory of mind, depending on how they are prompted, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even when partner policies are exceedingly simple. Our work serves to highlight the double sided nature of inductive bias in LLMs when adapting to new situations. While this bias can lead to strong performance over limited horizons, it often hinders convergence to optimal long-term behavior.|Matthew Riemer et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19726)|null|
|**2024-12-27**|**Toward Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models with Thought Rollback**|Large language models (LLMs) have been routinely used to solve various tasks using step-by-step reasoning. However, the structure of intermediate reasoning steps, or thoughts, is rigid and unidirectional, such as chains, trees, or acyclic-directed graphs. Consequently, the resulting inflexible and forward-only reasoning may not address challenging tasks and fail when the LLM frequently gives false responses, i.e., ``hallucinations''. This paper proposes a new reasoning framework, called Thought Rollback (TR), allowing LLMs to adaptively build thought structure while maintaining effective reasoning toward problem-solving under ``hallucinations''. The core mechanism of TR is rolling back thoughts, which allows LLMs to perform error analysis on thoughts, and thus roll back to any previously mistaken thought for revision. Subsequently, by including such trial-and-error in the prompt to guide the LLM, each rollback leads to one more reliable reasoning path. Therefore, starting with a simple prompt without human annotations, LLM with TR adaptively and gradually explores thoughts for a correct solution. Comprehensive experiments on mathematical problems and multi-task reasoning demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TR in terms of problem-solving rate and interaction cost. For instance, the solving rate of GPT-4 with TR outperforms the current best by $9\%$ on the MATH dataset.|Sijia Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19707)|**[link](https://github.com/iQua/llmpebase)**|
|**2024-12-27**|**A Large-scale Interpretable Multi-modality Benchmark for Facial Image Forgery Localization**|Image forgery localization, which centers on identifying tampered pixels within an image, has seen significant advancements. Traditional approaches often model this challenge as a variant of image segmentation, treating the binary segmentation of forged areas as the end product. We argue that the basic binary forgery mask is inadequate for explaining model predictions. It doesn't clarify why the model pinpoints certain areas and treats all forged pixels the same, making it hard to spot the most fake-looking parts. In this study, we mitigate the aforementioned limitations by generating salient region-focused interpretation for the forgery images. To support this, we craft a Multi-Modal Tramper Tracing (MMTT) dataset, comprising facial images manipulated using deepfake techniques and paired with manual, interpretable textual annotations. To harvest high-quality annotation, annotators are instructed to meticulously observe the manipulated images and articulate the typical characteristics of the forgery regions. Subsequently, we collect a dataset of 128,303 image-text pairs. Leveraging the MMTT dataset, we develop ForgeryTalker, an architecture designed for concurrent forgery localization and interpretation. ForgeryTalker first trains a forgery prompter network to identify the pivotal clues within the explanatory text. Subsequently, the region prompter is incorporated into multimodal large language model for finetuning to achieve the dual goals of localization and interpretation. Extensive experiments conducted on the MMTT dataset verify the superior performance of our proposed model. The dataset, code as well as pretrained checkpoints will be made publicly available to facilitate further research and ensure the reproducibility of our results.|Jingchun Lian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19685)|null|
|**2024-12-27**|**Boosting Private Domain Understanding of Efficient MLLMs: A Tuning-free, Adaptive, Universal Prompt Optimization Framework**|Efficient multimodal large language models (EMLLMs), in contrast to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), reduce model size and computational costs and are often deployed on resource-constrained devices. However, due to data privacy concerns, existing open-source EMLLMs rarely have access to private domain-specific data during the pre-training process, making them difficult to directly apply in device-specific domains, such as certain business scenarios. To address this weakness, this paper focuses on the efficient adaptation of EMLLMs to private domains, specifically in two areas: 1) how to reduce data requirements, and 2) how to avoid parameter fine-tuning. Specifically, we propose a tun\textbf{\underline{I}}ng-free, a\textbf{\underline{D}}aptiv\textbf{\underline{E}}, univers\textbf{\underline{AL}} \textbf{\underline{Prompt}} Optimization Framework, abbreviated as \textit{\textbf{\ourmethod{}}} which consists of two stages: 1) Predefined Prompt, based on the reinforcement searching strategy, generate a prompt optimization strategy tree to acquire optimization priors; 2) Prompt Reflection initializes the prompt based on optimization priors, followed by self-reflection to further search and refine the prompt. By doing so, \ourmethod{} elegantly generates the ``ideal prompts'' for processing private domain-specific data. Note that our method requires no parameter fine-tuning and only a small amount of data to quickly adapt to the data distribution of private data. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that our proposed \ourmethod{} significantly improves both efficiency and performance compared to baselines.|Jiang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19684)|null|

Existing methods for creating CAD models rely on latent vectors or point clouds, which are difficult to obtain and costly to store. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have inspired researchers to use natural language instructions and images for CAD model construction. However, these models still struggle with inferring accurate 3D spatial location and orientation, leading to inaccuracies in determining the spatial 3D starting points and extrusion directions for constructing geometries. This work introduces CAD-GPT, a CAD synthesis method with spatial reasoning-enhanced MLLM that takes either a single image or a textual description as input. To achieve precise spatial inference, our approach introduces a 3D Modeling Spatial Mechanism. This method maps 3D spatial positions and 3D sketch plane rotation angles into a 1D linguistic feature space using a specialized spatial unfolding mechanism, while discretizing 2D sketch coordinates into an appropriate planar space to enable precise determination of spatial starting position, sketch orientation, and 2D sketch coordinate translations.

Generative linguistic steganography leverages the probability distribution of language models (LMs) and applies steganographic algorithms to generate stego tokens, gaining attention with recent Large Language Model (LLM) advancements. To enhance security, researchers develop distribution-preserving stego algorithms to minimize the gap between stego sampling and LM sampling. However, the reliance on language model distributions, coupled with deviations from real-world cover texts, results in insufficient imperceptibility when facing steganalysis detectors in real-world scenarios. Moreover, LLM distributions tend to be more deterministic, resulting in reduced entropy and, consequently, lower embedding capacity. In this paper, we propose FreStega, a plug-and-play method to reconstruct the distribution of language models used for generative linguistic steganography. FreStega dynamically adjusts token probabilities from the language model at each step of stegotext auto-regressive generation, leveraging both sequential and spatial dimensions. In sequential adjustment, the temperature is dynamically adjusted based on instantaneous entropy, enhancing the diversity of stego texts and boosting embedding capacity. In the spatial dimension, the distribution is aligned with guidance from the target domain corpus, closely mimicking real cover text in the target domain. By reforming the distribution, FreStega enhances the imperceptibility of stego text in practical scenarios and improves steganographic capacity by 15.41\%, all without compromising the quality of the generated text. FreStega serves as a plug-and-play remedy to enhance the imperceptibility and embedding capacity of existing distribution-preserving steganography methods in real-world scenarios.|Kaiyi Pang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19652)|null|

With these considerations we propose SpeechSSM, the first speech language model to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates, based on recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling. Furthermore, to address growing challenges in spoken language evaluation, especially in this new long-form setting, we propose: new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; quality measurements over length and time; and a new benchmark for long-form speech processing and generation, LibriSpeech-Long.

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players.

|**2024-12-24**|**A Paragraph is All It Takes: Rich Robot Behaviors from Interacting, Trusted LLMs**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are compact representations of all public knowledge of our physical environment and animal and human behaviors. The application of LLMs to robotics may offer a path to highly capable robots that perform well across most human tasks with limited or even zero tuning. Aside from increasingly sophisticated reasoning and task planning, networks of (suitably designed) LLMs offer ease of upgrading capabilities and allow humans to directly observe the robot's thinking. Here we explore the advantages, limitations, and particularities of using LLMs to control physical robots. The basic system consists of four LLMs communicating via a human language data bus implemented via web sockets and ROS2 message passing. Surprisingly, rich robot behaviors and good performance across different tasks could be achieved despite the robot's data fusion cycle running at only 1Hz and the central data bus running at the extremely limited rates of the human brain, of around 40 bits/s. The use of natural language for inter-LLM communication allowed the robot's reasoning and decision making to be directly observed by humans and made it trivial to bias the system's behavior with sets of rules written in plain English. These rules were immutably written into Ethereum, a global, public, and censorship resistant Turing-complete computer. We suggest that by using natural language as the data bus among interacting AIs, and immutable public ledgers to store behavior constraints, it is possible to build robots that combine unexpectedly rich performance, upgradability, and durable alignment with humans.|OpenMind et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18588)|null|
|**2024-12-24**|**Exploring Embedding Priors in Prompt-Tuning for Improved Interpretability and Control**|Prompt-Tuning is an efficient method for adapting pre-trained language models to new tasks with minimal computational overhead by modifying prompt embeddings. In this work, we investigate how crucial the phenomenon of embedding collapse, frequently observed in Prompt-Tuning, is for the final performance of the model. To address this question, we designed embedding priors and compared them with posteriors of the converged Soft and Deep Prompt-Tuning methods. Our findings suggest that priors strongly affect the position of the tuned embeddings, and models can effectively work with embeddings from different parts of activation spaces, including completely new regions. As the final Prompt-Tuning capabilities are limited, we hypothesize that controllable Prompt-Tuning posteriors may serve as a good starting point for tasks such as chain-of-thought (COT) distillation. Our experiments also show that generated trajectories are not localized in the activation space of the models. However, there are distinct clusters of activations for distant tasks (e.g., NLP and arithmetic), while activations between NLP tasks (e.g., Question-Answering and MLM) lie in the same cluster. These observations raise questions about the importance of a single activation cluster for the generalization abilities of large language models.|Sergey Sedov et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18582)|null|

Benchmark and Evaluation**|Recently, an increasing number of AI-driven programming assistants powered by code LLMs have been integrated into various real-world software development environments, significantly boosting developer productivity. However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily focus on general-purpose scenarios, leaving the code generation performance of LLMs for specific application domains largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, MultiCodeBench, to fill this gap. MultiCodeBench comprises 2,400 programming tasks, covering 12 popular software development domains and 15 programming languages. Specifically, we perform in-depth research to identify these 12 application domains. Given that each domain may involve multiple technical frameworks, and that different frameworks present distinct challenges in the coding process, we categorize the commonly used frameworks and platforms within each domain. We then sample programming problems from GitHub repositories related to these subdomains. To ensure the quality of the tasks and mitigate data leakage issues, we invite annotators to rewrite the docstrings for each task in MultiCodeBench. Additionally, we build a static analysis-based dependency parsing tool to extract the dependencies in the ground truth for each task, enabling deeper performance analysis. Through extensive experiments on MultiCodeBench with eleven representative mainstream LLMs, we reveal the code generation performance of the LLMs across different application domains, providing practical insights for developers in downstream fields when selecting LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze the reasons behind the models' failures in completing software application development tasks, offering guidance for model developers to enhance domain-specific code generation capabilities.|Dewu Zheng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18573)|**[link](https://github.com/deepsoftwareanalytics/multicodebench)**|

In this work, we propose to leverage a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to perform ST and ASR in languages for which the model has never seen paired audio-text data. We achieve this by using a pre-trained multilingual speech encoder, a multilingual LLM, and a lightweight adaptation module that maps the audio representations to the token embedding space of the LLM. We perform several experiments both in ST and ASR to understand how to best train the model and what data has the most impact on performance in previously unseen languages. In ST, our best model is capable to achieve BLEU scores over 23 in CoVoST2 for two previously unseen languages, while in ASR, we achieve WERs of up to 28.2\%.

Recent studies demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) possess exceptional sentiment understanding capabilities. However, directly deploying LLMs for FSA applications incurs high inference costs. Therefore, this paper investigates the distillation of fine-grained sentiment understanding from LLMs into small language models (SLMs). We prompt LLMs to examine and interpret the sentiments of given reviews and then utilize the generated content to pretrain SLMs. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive FSA benchmark to evaluate both SLMs and LLMs. Extensive experiments on this benchmark reveal that: (1) distillation significantly enhances the performance of SLMs in FSA tasks, achieving a 6.00\% improvement in $F_1$ -score, and the distilled model can outperform Llama-2-7b with only 220M parameters; (2) distillation equips SLMs with excellent zero-shot sentiment classification capabilities, enabling them to match or even exceed their teacher models. These results suggest that distillation from LLMs is a highly promising direction for FSA.

Combining a dynamic leaderboard with an interactive LLM arena, Libra-Leaderboard encourages the joint optimization of capability and safety. Unlike traditional approaches that average performance and safety metrics, Libra-Leaderboard uses a distance-to-optimal-score method to calculate the overall rankings. This approach incentivizes models to achieve a balance rather than excelling in one dimension at the expense of some other ones. In the first release, Libra-Leaderboard evaluates 26 mainstream LLMs from 14 leading organizations, identifying critical safety challenges even in state-of-the-art models.|Haonan Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18551)|null|
|**2024-12-24**|**Token-Budget-Aware LLM Reasoning**|Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework, which dynamically estimates token budgets for different problems based on reasoning complexity and uses the estimated token budgets to guide the reasoning process. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

|**2024-12-24**|**Consistency Checks for Language Model Forecasters**|Forecasting is a task that is difficult to evaluate: the ground truth can only be known in the future. Recent work showing LLM forecasters rapidly approaching human-level performance begs the question: how can we benchmark and evaluate these forecasters instantaneously? Following the consistency check framework, we measure the performance of forecasters in terms of the consistency of their predictions on different logically-related questions. We propose a new, general consistency metric based on arbitrage: for example, if a forecasting AI illogically predicts that both the Democratic and Republican parties have 60% probability of winning the 2024 US presidential election, an arbitrageur can trade against the forecaster's predictions and make a profit. We build an automated evaluation system that generates a set of base questions, instantiates consistency checks from these questions, elicits the predictions of the forecaster, and measures the consistency of the predictions. We then build a standard, proper-scoring-rule forecasting benchmark, and show that our (instantaneous) consistency metrics correlate with LLM forecasters' ground truth Brier scores (which are only known in the future). We also release a consistency benchmark that resolves in 2028, providing a long-term evaluation tool for forecasting.|Daniel Paleka et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18544)|null|
|**2024-12-23**|**ChatGarment: Garment Estimation, Generation and Editing via Large Language Models**|We introduce ChatGarment, a novel approach that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) to automate the estimation, generation, and editing of 3D garments from images or text descriptions. Unlike previous methods that struggle in real-world scenarios or lack interactive editing capabilities, ChatGarment can estimate sewing patterns from in-the-wild images or sketches, generate them from text descriptions, and edit garments based on user instructions, all within an interactive dialogue. These sewing patterns can then be draped into 3D garments, which are easily animatable and simulatable. This is achieved by finetuning a VLM to directly generate a JSON file that includes both textual descriptions of garment types and styles, as well as continuous numerical attributes. This JSON file is then used to create sewing patterns through a programming parametric model. To support this, we refine the existing programming model, GarmentCode, by expanding its garment type coverage and simplifying its structure for efficient VLM fine-tuning. Additionally, we construct a large-scale dataset of image-to-sewing-pattern and text-to-sewing-pattern pairs through an automated data pipeline. Extensive evaluations demonstrate ChatGarment's ability to accurately reconstruct, generate, and edit garments from multimodal inputs, highlighting its potential to revolutionize workflows in fashion and gaming applications.

Addressing this question can deepen our understanding of the processes behind idea brainstorming and inspire the automatic discovery of novel scientific insights. In this work, we propose ResearchTown, a multi-agent framework for research community simulation. Within this framework, the human research community is simplified and modeled as an agent-data graph, where researchers and papers are represented as agent-type and data-type nodes, respectively, and connected based on their collaboration relationships. We also introduce TextGNN, a text-based inference framework that models various research activities (e.g., paper reading, paper writing, and review writing) as special forms of a unified message-passing process on the agent-data graph. To evaluate the quality of the research simulation, we present ResearchBench, a benchmark that uses a node-masking prediction task for scalable and objective assessment based on similarity. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) ResearchTown can provide a realistic simulation of collaborative research activities, including paper writing and review writing; (2) ResearchTown can maintain robust simulation with multiple researchers and diverse papers; (3) ResearchTown can generate interdisciplinary research ideas that potentially inspire novel research directions.|Haofei Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17767)|**[link](https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/research-town)**|
|**2024-12-23**|**In Case You Missed It: ARC 'Challenge' Is Not That Challenging**|ARC Challenge appears more difficult than ARC Easy for modern LLMs primarily due to an evaluation setup that prevents direct comparison of answer choices rather than inherent complexity. Although some researchers have quietly shifted to a more appropriate scheme over the last year, the implications of this change have yet to be widely acknowledged. We highlight this overlooked shift, show how similar evaluation practices falsely imply reasoning deficits in other benchmarks, and demonstrate that fairer methods dramatically reduce performance gaps (e.g. on SIQA) and even yield superhuman results (OpenBookQA). In doing so, we reveal how evaluation shapes perceived difficulty and offer guidelines to ensure that multiple-choice evaluations accurately reflect actual model capabilities.|Łukasz Borchmann et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17758)|null|

To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces ADC, an innovative approach that enhances LLMs' ability to follow function formats and match complex parameters. ADC utilizes a high-quality code fine-tuning dataset with line-level execution feedback, providing granular process supervision that fosters strong logical reasoning and adherence to function formats. It also employs an adversarial dataset generation process to improve parameter matching. The staged training methodology capitalizes on both enriched code datasets and refined adversarial datasets, leading to marked improvements in function calling capabilities on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) Benchmark. The innovation of ADC lies in its strategic combination of process supervision, adversarial refinement, and incremental learning, setting a new standard for LLM proficiency in complex function calling.|Wei Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17754)|null|
|**2024-12-23**|**Deliberation in Latent Space via Differentiable Cache Augmentation**|Techniques enabling large language models (LLMs) to "think more" by generating and attending to intermediate reasoning steps have shown promise in solving complex problems. However, the standard approaches generate sequences of discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur significant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we demonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the cache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of subsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss from the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself frozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its kv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate offline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the coprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra computation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder achieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even without any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a range of reasoning-intensive tasks.|Luyang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17747)|null|
|**2024-12-23**|**RepoTransBench: A Real-World Benchmark for Repository-Level Code Translation**|Repository-level code translation refers to translating an entire code repository from one programming language to another while preserving the functionality of the source repository. Many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the performance of such code translators. However, previous benchmarks mostly provide fine-grained samples, focusing at either code snippet, function, or file-level code translation. Such benchmarks do not accurately reflect real-world demands, where entire repositories often need to be translated, involving longer code length and more complex functionalities. To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, named RepoTransBench, which is a real-world repository-level code translation benchmark with an automatically executable test suite. We conduct experiments on RepoTransBench to evaluate the translation performance of 11 advanced LLMs. We find that the Success@1 score (test success in one attempt) of the best-performing LLM is only 7.33%. To further explore the potential of LLMs for repository-level code translation, we provide LLMs with error-related feedback to perform iterative debugging and observe an average 7.09% improvement on Success@1. However, even with this improvement, the Success@1 score of the best-performing LLM is only 21%, which may not meet the need for reliable automatic repository-level code translation. Finally, we conduct a detailed error analysis and highlight current LLMs' deficiencies in repository-level code translation, which could provide a reference for further improvements.|Yanli Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17744)|null|

Our pre-training approach focuses on enhancing training efficacy through three key technical contributions: an elaborate data pipeline combines data cleaning with data schedule strategies, a robust optimization method to mitigate training instability, and an effective annealing approach that incorporates targeted data selection and long context training. Remarkably, YuLan-Mini, trained on 1.08T tokens, achieves performance comparable to industry-leading models that require significantly more data.

|**2024-12-23**|**Reasoning to Attend: Try to Understand How <SEG> Token Works**|Current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) empowered visual grounding typically rely on $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token as a text prompt to jointly optimize the vision-language model (e.g., LLaVA) and the downstream task-specified model (\eg, SAM). However, we observe that little research has looked into how it works.In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained by computing the semantic similarity between the $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token and the image token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA encoder and SAM decoder. Intriguingly, we have found that a striking consistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map,which reveals that what $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token contributes to is the semantic similarity within image-text pairs. Specifically, $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a placeholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual tokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the paired image while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned. Upon the above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient $\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\textbf{D}$ under the guidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps. Remarkably, READ features an intuitive design, Similarity as Points module (SasP), which can be seamlessly applied to $\texttt{<SEG>}$ -like paradigms in a plug-and-play fashion.Also, extensive experiments have been conducted on the ReasonSeg and RefCOCO(+/g) datasets. To validate whether READ suffers from catastrophic forgetting of previous skills after fine-tuning, we further assess its generation ability on an augmented FP-RefCOCO(+/g) dataset.

To address this gap, we construct Chumor, the first Chinese humor explanation dataset that exceeds the size of existing humor datasets. Chumor is sourced from Ruo Zhi Ba, a Chinese Reddit-like platform known for sharing intellectually challenging and culturally specific jokes. We test ten LLMs through direct and chain-of-thought prompting, revealing that Chumor poses significant challenges to existing LLMs, with their accuracy slightly above random and far below human.

|**2024-12-23**|**Knowledge Editing through Chain-of-Thought**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, keeping these models up-to-date with evolving world knowledge remains a significant challenge due to the high costs of frequent retraining. To address this challenge, knowledge editing techniques have emerged to update LLMs with new information without rebuilding the model from scratch. Among these, the in-context editing paradigm stands out for its effectiveness in integrating new knowledge while preserving the model's original capabilities. Despite its potential, existing in-context knowledge editing methods are often task-specific, focusing primarily on multi-hop QA tasks using structured knowledge triples. Moreover, their reliance on few-shot prompting for task decomposition makes them unstable and less effective in generalizing across diverse tasks.   In response to these limitations, we propose EditCoT, a novel knowledge editing framework that flexibly and efficiently updates LLMs across various tasks without retraining. EditCoT works by generating a chain-of-thought (CoT) for a given input and then iteratively refining this CoT process using a CoT editor based on updated knowledge. We evaluate EditCoT across a diverse range of benchmarks, covering multiple languages and tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering superior generalization, effectiveness, and stability compared to existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of knowledge updating.

|**2024-12-20**|**HoVLE: Unleashing the Power of Monolithic Vision-Language Models with Holistic Vision-Language Embedding**|The rapid advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Monolithic VLMs, which avoid modality-specific encoders, offer a promising alternative to the compositional ones but face the challenge of inferior performance. Most existing monolithic VLMs require tuning pre-trained LLMs to acquire vision abilities, which may degrade their language capabilities. To address this dilemma, this paper presents a novel high-performance monolithic VLM named HoVLE. We note that LLMs have been shown capable of interpreting images, when image embeddings are aligned with text embeddings. The challenge for current monolithic VLMs actually lies in the lack of a holistic embedding module for both vision and language inputs. Therefore, HoVLE introduces a holistic embedding module that converts visual and textual inputs into a shared space, allowing LLMs to process images in the same way as texts. Furthermore, a multi-stage training strategy is carefully designed to empower the holistic embedding module. It is first trained to distill visual features from a pre-trained vision encoder and text embeddings from the LLM, enabling large-scale training with unpaired random images and text tokens. The whole model further undergoes next-token prediction on multi-modal data to align the embeddings. Finally, an instruction-tuning stage is incorporated. Our experiments show that HoVLE achieves performance close to leading compositional models on various benchmarks, outperforming previous monolithic models by a large margin.

|**2024-12-20**|**Offline Reinforcement Learning for LLM Multi-Step Reasoning**|Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) with offline reinforcement learning (RL) is essential for quickly adapting them to complex tasks. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promise in aligning LLMs with human preferences, it is less suitable for multi-step reasoning tasks because (1) DPO relies on paired preference data, which is not readily available for multi-step reasoning tasks, and (2) it treats all tokens uniformly, making it ineffective for credit assignment in multi-step reasoning tasks, which often come with sparse reward. In this work, we propose OREO (Offline Reasoning Optimization), an offline RL method for enhancing LLM multi-step reasoning. Building on insights from previous works of maximum entropy reinforcement learning, it jointly learns a policy model and value function by optimizing the soft Bellman Equation. We show in principle that it reduces the need to collect pairwise data and enables better credit assignment. Empirically, OREO surpasses existing offline learning methods on multi-step reasoning benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K, MATH) and embodied agent control (ALFWorld). The approach can be extended to a multi-iteration framework when additional resources are available. Furthermore, the learned value function can be leveraged to guide the tree search for free, which can further boost performance during test time.|Huaijie Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16145)|null|
|**2024-12-20**|**Can LLMs Obfuscate Code? A Systematic Analysis of Large Language Models into Assembly Code Obfuscation**|Malware authors often employ code obfuscations to make their malware harder to detect. Existing tools for generating obfuscated code often require access to the original source code (e.g., C++ or Java), and adding new obfuscations is a non-trivial, labor-intensive process. In this study, we ask the following question: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially generate a new obfuscated assembly code? If so, this poses a risk to anti-virus engines and potentially increases the flexibility of attackers to create new obfuscation patterns. We answer this in the affirmative by developing the MetamorphASM benchmark comprising MetamorphASM Dataset (MAD) along with three code obfuscation techniques: dead code, register substitution, and control flow change. The MetamorphASM systematically evaluates the ability of LLMs to generate and analyze obfuscated code using MAD, which contains 328,200 obfuscated assembly code samples. We release this dataset and analyze the success rate of various LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5/4, GPT-4o-mini, Starcoder, CodeGemma, CodeLlama, CodeT5, and LLaMA 3.1) in generating obfuscated assembly code. The evaluation was performed using established information-theoretic metrics and manual human review to ensure correctness and provide the foundation for researchers to study and develop remediations to this risk.

We show that standard message-driven mechanisms cannot implement socially efficient allocations when agents have multidimensional types, even under favorable conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose data-driven mechanisms that leverage additional post-allocation information, modeled as an estimator of the payoff-relevant state. Our data-driven mechanisms extend the classic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves class. We show that they achieve exact implementation in posterior equilibrium when the state is either fully revealed or the utility is linear in an unbiased estimator. We also show that they achieve approximate implementation with a consistent estimator, converging to exact implementation as the estimator converges, and present bounds on the convergence rate.

In this paper, we propose a prompt optimization approach that uses a smaller, fine-tuned language model to compress input data for evaluation prompt, thus reducing token usage and computational cost when using larger LLMs for downstream evaluation. Our method involves a two-stage fine-tuning process: supervised fine-tuning followed by preference optimization to refine the model's outputs based on human preferences. We focus on Machine Translation (MT) evaluation and utilize the GEMBA-MQM metric as a starting point. Our results show a $2.37\times$ reduction in token usage without any loss in evaluation quality. This work makes state-of-the-art LLM-based metrics like GEMBA-MQM more cost-effective and efficient, enhancing their accessibility for broader use.|Daniil Larionov et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16120)|null|

However, the substantial redundancy in video data presents significant computational challenges for LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a training-free method that 1) minimizes video redundancy by merging spatial-temporal tokens, and 2) leverages LLMs' reasoning capabilities to selectively prune visual features relevant to question tokens, enhancing model efficiency.

We propose and validate a methodology for measuring the content-moderation-induced distortions in online discourse using text embeddings from computational linguistics. We test our measure on a representative dataset of 5 million US political Tweets and find that removing toxic Tweets distorts online content. This finding is consistent across different embedding models, toxicity metrics, and samples. Importantly, we demonstrate that content-moderation-induced distortions are not caused by the toxic language. Instead, we show that, as a side effect, content moderation shifts the mean and variance of the embedding space, distorting the topic composition of online content. Finally, we propose an alternative approach to content moderation that uses generative Large Language Models to rephrase toxic Tweets to preserve their salvageable content rather than removing them entirely. We demonstrate that this rephrasing strategy reduces toxicity while minimizing distortions in online content.|Mahyar Habibi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16114)|null|

Our work therefore addresses the logical inconsistency of LLMs under complex logical queries with primitive logical operators, e.g., negation, conjunction, and disjunction. As a test bed, we consider retrieval-augmented LLMs on a fact-checking task involving propositional logic queries from real-world knowledge graphs (KGs). Our contributions are three-fold. Benchmark: We introduce three logical fact-checking datasets over KGs for community development towards logically consistent LLMs. Assessment: We propose consistency measures of LLMs on propositional logic queries as input and demonstrate that existing LLMs lack logical consistency, specially on complex queries. Improvement: We employ supervised fine-tuning to improve the logical consistency of LLMs on the complex fact-checking task with KG contexts.|Bishwamittra Ghosh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16100)|null|

This paper explores the evolution of LLM adoption among practitioners at a large technology company, evaluating the impact of LLMs in data curation tasks through participants' perceptions, integration strategies, and reported usage scenarios. Through a series of surveys, interviews, and user studies, we provide a timely snapshot of how organizations are navigating a pivotal moment in LLM evolution. In Q2 2023, we conducted a survey to assess LLM adoption in industry for development tasks (N=84), and facilitated expert interviews to assess evolving data needs (N=10) in Q3 2023. In Q2 2024, we explored practitioners' current and anticipated LLM usage through a user study involving two LLM-based prototypes (N=12). While each study addressed distinct research goals, they revealed a broader narrative about evolving LLM usage in aggregate. We discovered an emerging shift in data understanding from heuristic-first, bottom-up approaches to insights-first, top-down workflows supported by LLMs. Furthermore, to respond to a more complex data landscape, data practitioners now supplement traditional subject-expert-created 'golden datasets' with LLM-generated 'silver' datasets and rigorously validated 'super golden' datasets curated by diverse experts.

We employ both automated and manual review processes to maintain high quality and difficulty, resulting in human experts achieving only 53.7% accuracy under a 15-minute time constraint. Our evaluation reveals that the best-performing model, when directly answers the questions, achieves only 50.1% accuracy. In contrast, the o1-preview model, which includes longer reasoning, achieves 57.7%, surpassing the human baseline by 4%. These results highlight the importance of enhanced reasoning ability and scaling inference-time compute to tackle the long-context challenges in LongBench v2.

|**2024-12-19**|**MMLU-CF: A Contamination-free Multi-task Language Understanding Benchmark**|Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense, understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination, resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage, we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard.

Evaluating RAG-based Fact-checking Pipelines in Realistic Settings**|Natural Language Processing and Generation systems have recently shown the potential to complement and streamline the costly and time-consuming job of professional fact-checkers. In this work, we lift several constraints of current state-of-the-art pipelines for automated fact-checking based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm. Our goal is to benchmark, under more realistic scenarios, RAG-based methods for the generation of verdicts - i.e., short texts discussing the veracity of a claim - evaluating them on stylistically complex claims and heterogeneous, yet reliable, knowledge bases. Our findings show a complex landscape, where, for example, LLM-based retrievers outperform other retrieval techniques, though they still struggle with heterogeneous knowledge bases; larger models excel in verdict faithfulness, while smaller models provide better context adherence, with human evaluations favouring zero-shot and one-shot approaches for informativeness, and fine-tuned models for emotional alignment.|Daniel Russo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15189)|**[link](https://github.com/drusso98/face-the-facts)**|
|**2024-12-19**|**LlamaFusion: Adapting Pretrained Language Models for Multimodal Generation**|We present LlamaFusion, a framework for empowering pretrained text-only large language models (LLMs) with multimodal generative capabilities, enabling them to understand and generate both text and images in arbitrary sequences. LlamaFusion leverages existing Llama-3's weights for processing texts autoregressively while introducing additional and parallel transformer modules for processing images with diffusion. During training, the data from each modality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward layers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each modality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow interactions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific modules and only training the image-specific modules, LlamaFusion preserves the language capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual understanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain multimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that, LlamaFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models with multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages existing computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the parallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a promising direction for efficient multimodal model development.|Weijia Shi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15188)|null|
|**2024-12-19**|**Data for Mathematical Copilots: Better Ways of Presenting Proofs for Machine Learning**|The suite of datasets commonly used to train and evaluate the mathematical capabilities of AI-based mathematical copilots (primarily large language models) exhibit several shortcomings. These limitations include a restricted scope of mathematical complexity, typically not exceeding lower undergraduate-level mathematics, binary rating protocols and other issues, which makes comprehensive proof-based evaluation suites difficult. We systematically explore these limitations and contend that enhancing the capabilities of large language models, or any forthcoming advancements in AI-based mathematical assistants (copilots or "thought partners"), necessitates a paradigm shift in the design of mathematical datasets and the evaluation criteria of mathematical ability: It is necessary to move away from result-based datasets (theorem statement to theorem proof) and convert the rich facets of mathematical research practice to data LLMs can train on. Examples of these are mathematical workflows (sequences of atomic, potentially subfield-dependent tasks that are often performed when creating new mathematics), which are an important part of the proof-discovery process. Additionally, we advocate for mathematical dataset developers to consider the concept of "motivated proof", introduced by G. P\'olya in 1949, which can serve as a blueprint for datasets that offer a better proof learning signal, alleviating some of the mentioned limitations. Lastly, we introduce math datasheets for datasets, extending the general, dataset-agnostic variants of datasheets: We provide a questionnaire designed specifically for math datasets that we urge dataset creators to include with their datasets. This will make creators aware of potential limitations of their datasets while at the same time making it easy for readers to assess it from the point of view of training and evaluating mathematical copilots.|Simon Frieder et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15184)|null|

Creating specialized models and tools for these domains is crucial towards gaining the benefits of LLMs in areas such as HPC. While previous work has explored HPC-specific models, LLMs still struggle to generate parallel code and it is not at all clear what hurdles are still holding back these LLMs and what must be done to overcome them. In this work, we conduct an in-depth study along the many axes of fine-tuning a specialized HPC LLM in order to better understand the challenges. Based on our findings we fine-tune and evaluate a specialized HPC LLM that is shown to be the best performing open-source code LLM for parallel code generation to date.|Aman Chaturvedi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15178)|null|
|**2024-12-19**|**Critical-Questions-of-Thought: Steering LLM reasoning with Argumentative Querying**|Studies have underscored how, regardless of the recent breakthrough and swift advances in AI research, even state-of-the-art Large Language models (LLMs) continue to struggle when performing logical and mathematical reasoning. The results seem to suggest that LLMs still work as (highly advanced) data pattern identifiers, scoring poorly when attempting to generalise and solve reasoning problems the models have never previously seen or that are not close to samples presented in their training data. To address this compelling concern, this paper makes use of the notion of critical questions from the literature on argumentation theory, focusing in particular on Toulmin's model of argumentation. We show that employing these critical questions can improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By probing the rationale behind the models' reasoning process, the LLM can assess whether some logical mistake is occurring and correct it before providing the final reply to the user prompt. The underlying idea is drawn from the gold standard of any valid argumentative procedure: the conclusion is valid if it is entailed by accepted premises. Or, to paraphrase such Aristotelian principle in a real-world approximation, characterised by incomplete information and presumptive logic, the conclusion is valid if not proved otherwise. This approach successfully steers the models' output through a reasoning pipeline, resulting in better performance against the baseline and its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementation. To this end, an extensive evaluation of the proposed approach on the MT-Bench Reasoning and Math tasks across a range of LLMs is provided.|Federico Castagna et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15177)|**[link](https://github.com/fcast07/cqot)**|
|**2024-12-19**|**Rethinking Uncertainty Estimation in Natural Language Generation**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in real-world applications, driving the need to evaluate the trustworthiness of their generated text. To this end, reliable uncertainty estimation is essential. Since current LLMs generate text autoregressively through a stochastic process, the same prompt can lead to varying outputs. Consequently, leading uncertainty estimation methods generate and analyze multiple output sequences to determine the LLM's uncertainty. However, generating output sequences is computationally expensive, making these methods impractical at scale. In this work, we inspect the theoretical foundations of the leading methods and explore new directions to enhance their computational efficiency. Building on the framework of proper scoring rules, we find that the negative log-likelihood of the most likely output sequence constitutes a theoretically grounded uncertainty measure. To approximate this alternative measure, we propose G-NLL, which has the advantage of being obtained using only a single output sequence generated by greedy decoding. This makes uncertainty estimation more efficient and straightforward, while preserving theoretical rigor. Empirical results demonstrate that G-NLL achieves state-of-the-art performance across various LLMs and tasks. Our work lays the foundation for efficient and reliable uncertainty estimation in natural language generation, challenging the necessity of more computationally involved methods currently leading the field.|Lukas Aichberger et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15176)|null|

However, achieving the desired output often entails multiple revisions and iterative inference to refine user-provided prompts. Current automatic methods for refining prompts encounter challenges such as Modality-Inconsistency, Cost-Discrepancy, and Model-Unaware when applied to text-to-video diffusion models. To address these problem, we introduce an LLM-based prompt adaptation framework, termed as Prompt-A-Video, which excels in crafting Video-Centric, Labor-Free and Preference-Aligned prompts tailored to specific video diffusion model. Our approach involves a meticulously crafted two-stage optimization and alignment system. Initially, we conduct a reward-guided prompt evolution pipeline to automatically create optimal prompts pool and leverage them for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of the LLM. Then multi-dimensional rewards are employed to generate pairwise data for the SFT model, followed by the direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm to further facilitate preference alignment. Through extensive experimentation and comparative analyses, we validate the effectiveness of Prompt-A-Video across diverse generation models, highlighting its potential to push the boundaries of video generation.|Yatai Ji et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15156)|**[link](https://github.com/jiyt17/prompt-a-video)**|

However, can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on million-scale video datasets also ``think in space'' from videos? We present a novel video-based visual-spatial intelligence benchmark (VSI-Bench) of over 5,000 question-answer pairs, and find that MLLMs exhibit competitive - though subhuman - visual-spatial intelligence. We probe models to express how they think in space both linguistically and visually and find that while spatial reasoning capabilities remain the primary bottleneck for MLLMs to reach higher benchmark performance, local world models and spatial awareness do emerge within these models. Notably, prevailing linguistic reasoning techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought, self-consistency, tree-of-thoughts) fail to improve performance, whereas explicitly generating cognitive maps during question-answering enhances MLLMs' spatial distance ability.|Jihan Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14171)|**[link](https://github.com/vision-x-nyu/thinking-in-space)**|
|**2024-12-18**|**MetaMorph: Multimodal Understanding and Generation via Instruction Tuning**|In this work, we propose Visual-Predictive Instruction Tuning (VPiT) - a simple and effective extension to visual instruction tuning that enables a pretrained LLM to quickly morph into an unified autoregressive model capable of generating both text and visual tokens. VPiT teaches an LLM to predict discrete text tokens and continuous visual tokens from any input sequence of image and text data curated in an instruction-following format. Our empirical investigation reveals several intriguing properties of VPiT: (1) visual generation ability emerges as a natural byproduct of improved visual understanding, and can be unlocked efficiently with a small amount of generation data; (2) while we find understanding and generation to be mutually beneficial, understanding data contributes to both capabilities more effectively than generation data. Building upon these findings, we train our MetaMorph model and achieve competitive performance on both visual understanding and generation. In visual generation, MetaMorph can leverage the world knowledge and reasoning abilities gained from LLM pretraining, and overcome common failure modes exhibited by other generation models. Our results suggest that LLMs may have strong "prior" vision capabilities that can be efficiently adapted to both visual understanding and generation with a relatively simple instruction tuning process.|Shengbang Tong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14164)|null|
|**2024-12-18**|**TheAgentCompany: Benchmarking LLM Agents on Consequential Real World Tasks**|We interact with computers on an everyday basis, be it in everyday life or work, and many aspects of work can be done entirely with access to a computer and the Internet. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at helping to accelerate or even autonomously perform work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications for both industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper, we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most competitive agent, 24% of the tasks can be completed autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents -- in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems.|Frank F.

However, recent work using Large Language Models (LLMs) for research idea generation often overlooks these theoretical foundations. We present a framework that explicitly implements combinatorial creativity theory using LLMs, featuring a generalization-level retrieval system for cross-domain knowledge discovery and a structured combinatorial process for idea generation. The retrieval system maps concepts across different abstraction levels to enable meaningful connections between disparate domains, while the combinatorial process systematically analyzes and recombines components to generate novel solutions. Experiments on the OAG-Bench dataset demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, consistently outperforming baseline approaches in generating ideas that align with real research developments (improving similarity scores by 7\%-10\% across multiple metrics). Our results provide strong evidence that LLMs can effectively realize combinatorial creativity when guided by appropriate theoretical frameworks, contributing both to practical advancement of AI-assisted research and theoretical understanding of machine creativity.|Tianyang Gu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14141)|null|

This paper critically examines whether recent LLM-based test generation tools, such as Codium CoverAgent and CoverUp, can effectively find bugs or unintentionally validate faulty code. Considering bugs are only exposed by failing test cases, we explore the question: can these tools truly achieve the intended objectives of software testing when their test oracles are designed to pass? Using real human-written buggy code as input, we evaluate these tools, showing how LLM-generated tests can fail to detect bugs and, more alarmingly, how their design can worsen the situation by validating bugs in the generated test suite and rejecting bug-revealing tests.

Recent works use alternative approaches like knowledge distillation to imitate o1's reasoning style, but their effectiveness is limited by the capability ceiling of the teacher model. Therefore, this paper analyzes the roadmap to achieving o1 from the perspective of reinforcement learning, focusing on four key components: policy initialization, reward design, search, and learning. Policy initialization enables models to develop human-like reasoning behaviors, equipping them with the ability to effectively explore solution spaces for complex problems. Reward design provides dense and effective signals via reward shaping or reward modeling, which is the guidance for both search and learning. Search plays a crucial role in generating high-quality solutions during both training and testing phases, which can produce better solutions with more computation. Learning utilizes the data generated by search for improving policy, which can achieve the better performance with more parameters and more searched data. Existing open-source projects that attempt to reproduce o1 can be seem as a part or a variant of our roadmap. Collectively, these components underscore how learning and search drive o1's advancement, making meaningful contributions to the development of LLM.|Zhiyuan Zeng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14135)|null|
|**2024-12-18**|**Alignment faking in large language models**|We present a demonstration of a large language model engaging in alignment faking: selectively complying with its training objective in training to prevent modification of its behavior out of training. First, we give Claude 3 Opus a system prompt stating it is being trained to answer all queries, even harmful ones, which conflicts with its prior training to refuse such queries. To allow the model to infer when it is in training, we say it will be trained only on conversations with free users, not paid users. We find the model complies with harmful queries from free users 14% of the time, versus almost never for paid users. Explaining this gap, in almost all cases where the model complies with a harmful query from a free user, we observe explicit alignment-faking reasoning, with the model stating it is strategically answering harmful queries in training to preserve its preferred harmlessness behavior out of training. Next, we study a more realistic setting where information about the training process is provided not in a system prompt, but by training on synthetic documents that mimic pre-training data--and observe similar alignment faking. Finally, we study the effect of actually training the model to comply with harmful queries via reinforcement learning, which we find increases the rate of alignment-faking reasoning to 78%, though also increases compliance even out of training. We additionally observe other behaviors such as the model exfiltrating its weights when given an easy opportunity. While we made alignment faking easier by telling the model when and by what criteria it was being trained, we did not instruct the model to fake alignment or give it any explicit goal. As future models might infer information about their training process without being told, our results suggest a risk of alignment faking in future models, whether due to a benign preference--as in this case--or not.|Ryan Greenblatt et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14093)|**[link](https://github.com/redwoodresearch/alignment_faking_public)**|

Decontextualization augments text (claims) to ensure it can be verified outside of the original context, enabling reliable verification. While decomposition and decontextualization have been explored independently, their interactions in a complete system have not been investigated. Their conflicting purposes can create tensions: decomposition isolates atomic facts while decontextualization inserts relevant information. Furthermore, a decontextualized subclaim presents a challenge to the verification step: what part of the augmented text should be verified as it now contains multiple atomic facts? We conduct an evaluation of different decomposition, decontextualization, and verification strategies and find that the choice of strategy matters in the resulting factuality scores.

This study investigates the algorithmic fidelity of LLMs, i.e., the ability to replicate the socio-cultural context and nuanced opinions of human participants. Using open-ended survey data from the German Longitudinal Election Studies (GLES), we prompt different LLMs to generate synthetic public opinions reflective of German subpopulations by incorporating demographic features into the persona prompts. Our results show that Llama performs better than other LLMs at representing subpopulations, particularly when there is lower opinion diversity within those groups. Our findings further reveal that the LLM performs better for supporters of left-leaning parties like The Greens and The Left compared to other parties, and matches the least with the right-party AfD. Additionally, the inclusion or exclusion of specific variables in the prompts can significantly impact the models' predictions. These findings underscore the importance of aligning LLMs to more effectively model diverse public opinions while minimizing political biases and enhancing robustness in representativeness.|Bolei Ma et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13169)|**[link](https://github.com/soda-lmu/llm-opinion-german)**|

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has quickly become a feasible solution for organizations looking to overcome the challenges of maintaining proprietary models and to help reduce LLM hallucinations in their query responses. However, RAG comes with its own issues regarding scaling data pipelines across tiered-access and disparate data sources. In many scenarios, it is necessary to query beyond a single data silo to provide richer and more relevant context for an LLM. Analyzing data sources within and across organizational trust boundaries is often limited by complex data-sharing policies that prohibit centralized data storage, therefore, inhibit the fast and effective setup and scaling of RAG solutions. In this paper, we introduce Confidential Computing (CC) techniques as a solution for secure Federated Retrieval Augmented Generation (FedRAG). Our proposed Confidential FedRAG system (C-FedRAG) enables secure connection and scaling of a RAG workflows across a decentralized network of data providers by ensuring context confidentiality. We also demonstrate how to implement a C-FedRAG system using the NVIDIA FLARE SDK and assess its performance using the MedRAG toolkit and MIRAGE benchmarking dataset.|Parker Addison et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13163)|null|
|**2024-12-17**|**SWAN: Preprocessing SGD Enables Adam-Level Performance On LLM Training With Significant Memory Reduction**|Adaptive optimizers such as Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) have been central to the success of large language models. However, they maintain additional moving average states throughout training, which results in memory requirements several times greater than the model. This overhead imposes constraints on scalability and computational efficiency. On the other hand, while stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is optimal in terms of memory efficiency, their capability in LLM training is limited (Zhao et al., 2024b).   To address this dilemma, we show that pre-processing SGD is sufficient to reach Adam-level performance on LLMs. Specifically, we propose to preprocess the instantaneous stochastic gradients with two simple operators: $\mathtt{GradNorm}$ and $\mathtt{GradWhitening}$. $\mathtt{GradNorm}$ stabilizes gradient distributions, and $\mathtt{GradWhitening}$ counteracts the local curvature of the loss landscape, respectively. This results in SWAN (SGD with Whitening And Normalization), a stochastic optimizer that eliminates the need to store any accumulative state variables. Empirically, SWAN has the same memory footprint as SGD, achieving $\approx 50\%$ reduction on total end-to-end memory compared to Adam. In language modeling tasks, SWAN demonstrates the same or even a substantial improvement over Adam. Specifically, when pre-training the LLaMa model with 350M and 1.3B parameters, SWAN achieves a 2x speedup by reaching the same evaluation perplexity in less than half tokens seen.|Chao Ma et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13148)|null|
|**2024-12-17**|**Are Your LLMs Capable of Stable Reasoning?**|The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks. However, a significant discrepancy persists between benchmark performances and real-world applications. We identify this gap as primarily stemming from current evaluation protocols and metrics, which inadequately capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities, particularly in complex reasoning tasks where both accuracy and consistency are crucial. This work makes two key contributions. First, we introduce G-Pass@k, a novel evaluation metric that provides a continuous assessment of model performance across multiple sampling attempts, quantifying both the model's peak performance potential and its stability.

While recent mainstream efforts in the LLM community mainly focus on scaling data and compute for improved capabilities of LLMs, we argue that it is also very important to enable LLM systems, or language agents, to continuously adapt to the diverse and ever-changing profiles of every distinct user and provide up-to-date personalized assistance. We provide a clear task formulation and introduce a simple, general, effective, and scalable framework for life-long personalization of LLM systems and language agents. To facilitate future research on LLM personalization, we also introduce methods to synthesize realistic benchmarks and robust evaluation metrics. We will release all codes and data for building and benchmarking life-long personalized LLM systems.|Tiannan Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13103)|null|
|**2024-12-17**|**AIR-Bench: Automated Heterogeneous Information Retrieval Benchmark**|Evaluation plays a crucial role in the advancement of information retrieval (IR) models. However, current benchmarks, which are based on predefined domains and human-labeled data, face limitations in addressing evaluation needs for emerging domains both cost-effectively and efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose the Automated Heterogeneous Information Retrieval Benchmark (AIR-Bench). AIR-Bench is distinguished by three key features: 1) Automated. The testing data in AIR-Bench is automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) without human intervention. 2) Heterogeneous. The testing data in AIR-Bench is generated with respect to diverse tasks, domains and languages. 3) Dynamic. The domains and languages covered by AIR-Bench are constantly augmented to provide an increasingly comprehensive evaluation benchmark for community developers. We develop a reliable and robust data generation pipeline to automatically create diverse and high-quality evaluation datasets based on real-world corpora. Our findings demonstrate that the generated testing data in AIR-Bench aligns well with human-labeled testing data, making AIR-Bench a dependable benchmark for evaluating IR models. The resources in AIR-Bench are publicly available at https://github.com/AIR-Bench/AIR-Bench.|Jianlyu Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13102)|**[link](https://github.com/air-bench/air-bench)**|

We introduce natural language unit tests, a paradigm that decomposes response quality into explicit, testable criteria, along with a unified scoring model, LMUnit, which combines multi-objective training across preferences, direct ratings, and natural language rationales. Through controlled human studies, we show this paradigm significantly improves inter-annotator agreement and enables more effective LLM development workflows. LMUnit achieves state-of-the-art performance on evaluation benchmarks (FLASK, BigGenBench) and competitive results on RewardBench. These results validate both our proposed paradigm and scoring model, suggesting a promising path forward for language model evaluation and development.|Jon Saad-Falcon et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13091)|null|
|**2024-12-17**|**Modality-Inconsistent Continual Learning of Multimodal Large Language Models**|In this paper, we introduce Modality-Inconsistent Continual Learning (MICL), a new continual learning scenario for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that involves tasks with inconsistent modalities (image, audio, or video) and varying task types (captioning or question-answering). Unlike existing vision-only or modality-incremental settings, MICL combines modality and task type shifts, both of which drive catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose MoInCL, which employs a Pseudo Targets Generation Module to mitigate forgetting caused by task type shifts in previously seen modalities. It also incorporates Instruction-based Knowledge Distillation to preserve the model's ability to handle previously learned modalities when new ones are introduced. We benchmark MICL using a total of six tasks and conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed MoInCL. The experimental results highlight the superiority of MoInCL, showing significant improvements over representative and state-of-the-art continual learning baselines.|Weiguo Pian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13050)|null|
|**2024-12-16**|**SepLLM: Accelerate Large Language Models by Compressing One Segment into One Separator**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.|Guoxuan Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12094)|**[link](https://github.com/HKUDS/SepLLM)**|

Video frames inherently preserve the identity of subjects and scenes, ensuring consistent content preservation during editing. Additionally, video data captures diverse, natural dynamics-such as non-rigid subject motion and complex camera movements-that are difficult to model otherwise, making it an ideal source for scalable dataset construction. Using this approach, we create a new dataset to train InstructMove, a model capable of instruction-based complex manipulations that are difficult to achieve with synthetically generated datasets. Our model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as adjusting subject poses, rearranging elements, and altering camera perspectives.|Mingdeng Cao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12087)|null|
|**2024-12-16**|**CPath-Omni: A Unified Multimodal Foundation Model for Patch and Whole Slide Image Analysis in Computational Pathology**|The emergence of large multimodal models (LMMs) has brought significant advancements to pathology. Previous research has primarily focused on separately training patch-level and whole-slide image (WSI)-level models, limiting the integration of learned knowledge across patches and WSIs, and resulting in redundant models. In this work, we introduce CPath-Omni, the first 15-billion-parameter LMM designed to unify both patch and WSI level image analysis, consolidating a variety of tasks at both levels, including classification, visual question answering, captioning, and visual referring prompting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPath-Omni achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across seven diverse tasks on 39 out of 42 datasets, outperforming or matching task-specific models trained for individual tasks. Additionally, we develop a specialized pathology CLIP-based visual processor for CPath-Omni, CPath-CLIP, which, for the first time, integrates different vision models and incorporates a large language model as a text encoder to build a more powerful CLIP model, which achieves SOTA performance on nine zero-shot and four few-shot datasets. Our findings highlight CPath-Omni's ability to unify diverse pathology tasks, demonstrating its potential to streamline and advance the field of foundation model in pathology.|Yuxuan Sun et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12077)|null|
|**2024-12-16**|**CG-Bench: Clue-grounded Question Answering Benchmark for Long Video Understanding**|Most existing video understanding benchmarks for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) focus only on short videos. The limited number of benchmarks for long video understanding often rely solely on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, because of the inherent limitation of MCQ-based evaluation and the increasing reasoning ability of MLLMs, models can give the current answer purely by combining short video understanding with elimination, without genuinely understanding the video content. To address this gap, we introduce CG-Bench, a novel benchmark designed for clue-grounded question answering in long videos. CG-Bench emphasizes the model's ability to retrieve relevant clues for questions, enhancing evaluation credibility. It features 1,219 manually curated videos categorized by a granular system with 14 primary categories, 171 secondary categories, and 638 tertiary categories, making it the largest benchmark for long video analysis. The benchmark includes 12,129 QA pairs in three major question types: perception, reasoning, and hallucination. Compensating the drawbacks of pure MCQ-based evaluation, we design two novel clue-based evaluation methods: clue-grounded white box and black box evaluations, to assess whether the model generates answers based on the correct understanding of the video. We evaluate multiple closed-source and open-source MLLMs on CG-Bench. Results indicate that current models significantly underperform in understanding long videos compared to short ones, and a significant gap exists between open-source and commercial models. We hope CG-Bench can advance the development of more trustworthy and capable MLLMs for long video understanding.

Often, these expressions are used to convey controversial political opinions while maintaining plausible deniability and slip by content moderation filters. Identification of dog whistles relies on curated lexicons, which have trouble keeping up to date. We introduce \textbf{FETCH!}, a task for finding novel dog whistles in massive social media corpora.

We investigate various prompting strategies for vulnerability detection and, as part of this exploration, propose a prompting strategy that integrates natural language descriptions of vulnerabilities with a contrastive chain-of-thought reasoning approach, augmented using contrastive samples from a synthetic dataset. Our study highlights the potential of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities by integrating natural language descriptions, contrastive reasoning, and synthetic examples into a comprehensive prompting framework. Our results show that this approach can enhance LLM understanding of vulnerabilities. On a high-quality vulnerability detection dataset such as SVEN, our prompting strategies can improve accuracies, F1-scores, and pairwise accuracies by 23%, 11%, and 14%, respectively.|Ira Ceka et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12039)|null|
|**2024-12-16**|**LLMs for Cold-Start Cutting Plane Separator Configuration**|Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solvers ship with a staggering number of parameters that are challenging to select a priori for all but expert optimization users, but can have an outsized impact on the performance of the MILP solver. Existing machine learning (ML) approaches to configure solvers require training ML models by solving thousands of related MILP instances, generalize poorly to new problem sizes, and often require implementing complex ML pipelines and custom solver interfaces that can be difficult to integrate into existing optimization workflows. In this paper, we introduce a new LLM-based framework to configure which cutting plane separators to use for a given MILP problem with little to no training data based on characteristics of the instance, such as a natural language description of the problem and the associated LaTeX formulation. We augment these LLMs with descriptions of cutting plane separators available in a given solver, grounded by summarizing the existing research literature on separators. While individual solver configurations have a large variance in performance, we present a novel ensembling strategy that clusters and aggregates configurations to create a small portfolio of high-performing configurations. Our LLM-based methodology requires no custom solver interface, can find a high-performing configuration by solving only a small number of MILPs, and can generate the configuration with simple API calls that run in under a second. Numerical results show our approach is competitive with existing configuration approaches on a suite of classic combinatorial optimization problems and real-world datasets with only a fraction of the training data and computation time.|Connor Lawless et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12038)|null|

While current Speech LLMs excel at short-form tasks, they struggle with the computational and representational demands of longer audio sequences. To address this limitation, we propose SpeechPrune, a training-free token pruning strategy that uses speech-text similarity and approximated attention scores to efficiently discard irrelevant tokens. In SPIRAL, SpeechPrune achieves accuracy improvements of 29% and up to 47% over the original model and the random pruning model at a pruning rate of 20%, respectively. SpeechPrune can maintain network performance even at a pruning level of 80%. This approach highlights the potential of token-level pruning for efficient and scalable long-form speech understanding.|Yueqian Lin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12009)|null|
|**2024-12-16**|**Agentic AI-Driven Technical Troubleshooting for Enterprise Systems: A Novel Weighted Retrieval-Augmented Generation Paradigm**|Technical troubleshooting in enterprise environments often involves navigating diverse, heterogeneous data sources to resolve complex issues effectively. This paper presents a novel agentic AI solution built on a Weighted Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework tailored for enterprise technical troubleshooting. By dynamically weighting retrieval sources such as product manuals, internal knowledge bases, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides based on query context, the framework prioritizes the most relevant data. For instance, it gives precedence to product manuals for SKU-specific queries while incorporating general FAQs for broader issues. The system employs FAISS for efficient dense vector search, coupled with a dynamic aggregation mechanism to seamlessly integrate results from multiple sources. A Llama-based self-evaluator ensures the contextual accuracy and confidence of the generated responses before delivering them. This iterative cycle of retrieval and validation enhances precision, diversity, and reliability in response generation. Preliminary evaluations on large enterprise datasets demonstrate the framework's efficacy in improving troubleshooting accuracy, reducing resolution times, and adapting to varied technical challenges. Future research aims to enhance the framework by integrating advanced conversational AI capabilities, enabling more interactive and intuitive troubleshooting experiences. Efforts will also focus on refining the dynamic weighting mechanism through reinforcement learning to further optimize the relevance and precision of retrieved information. By incorporating these advancements, the proposed framework is poised to evolve into a comprehensive, autonomous AI solution, redefining technical service workflows across enterprise settings.|Rajat Khanda et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12006)|null|
|**2024-12-16**|**The Open Source Advantage in Large Language Models (LLMs)**|Large language models (LLMs) mark a key shift in natural language processing (NLP), having advanced text generation, translation, and domain-specific reasoning. Closed-source models like GPT-4, powered by proprietary datasets and extensive computational resources, lead with state-of-the-art performance today. However, they face criticism for their "black box" nature and for limiting accessibility in a manner that hinders reproducibility and equitable AI development. By contrast, open-source initiatives like LLaMA and BLOOM prioritize democratization through community-driven development and computational efficiency. These models have significantly reduced performance gaps, particularly in linguistic diversity and domain-specific applications, while providing accessible tools for global researchers and developers. Notably, both paradigms rely on foundational architectural innovations, such as the Transformer framework by Vaswani et al. (2017). Closed-source models excel by scaling effectively, while open-source models adapt to real-world applications in underrepresented languages and domains. Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and instruction-tuning datasets enable open-source models to achieve competitive results despite limited resources. To be sure, the tension between closed-source and open-source approaches underscores a broader debate on transparency versus proprietary control in AI. Ethical considerations further highlight this divide. Closed-source systems restrict external scrutiny, while open-source models promote reproducibility and collaboration but lack standardized auditing documentation frameworks to mitigate biases. Hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both paradigms are likely to shape the future of LLM innovation, ensuring accessibility, competitive technical performance, and ethical deployment.|Jiya Manchanda et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12004)|null|
|**2024-12-13**|**UniMed-CLIP: Towards a Unified Image-Text Pretraining Paradigm for Diverse Medical Imaging Modalities**|Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained via contrastive learning have achieved notable success in natural image tasks. However, their application in the medical domain remains limited due to the scarcity of openly accessible, large-scale medical image-text datasets. Existing medical VLMs either train on closed-source proprietary or relatively small open-source datasets that do not generalize well. Similarly, most models remain specific to a single or limited number of medical imaging domains, again restricting their applicability to other modalities. To address this gap, we introduce UniMed, a large-scale, open-source multi-modal medical dataset comprising over 5.3 million image-text pairs across six diverse imaging modalities: X-ray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound, Pathology, and Fundus. UniMed is developed using a data-collection framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform modality-specific classification datasets into image-text formats while incorporating existing image-text data from the medical domain, facilitating scalable VLM pretraining. Using UniMed, we trained UniMed-CLIP, a unified VLM for six modalities that significantly outperforms existing generalist VLMs and matches modality-specific medical VLMs, achieving notable gains in zero-shot evaluations. For instance, UniMed-CLIP improves over BiomedCLIP (trained on proprietary data) by an absolute gain of +12.61, averaged over 21 datasets, while using 3x less training data. To facilitate future research, we release UniMed dataset, training codes, and models at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/UniMed-CLIP.|Muhammad Uzair Khattak et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10372)|**[link](https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/unimed-clip)**|
|**2024-12-13**|**Robust image classification with multi-modal large language models**|Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., carefully crafted input samples that can cause models to make incorrect predictions with high confidence. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, adversarial training and detection-based defenses have been proposed to strengthen models in advance. However, most of these approaches focus on a single data modality, overlooking the relationships between visual patterns and textual descriptions of the input. In this paper, we propose a novel defense, Multi-Shield, designed to combine and complement these defenses with multi-modal information to further enhance their robustness. Multi-Shield leverages multi-modal large language models to detect adversarial examples and abstain from uncertain classifications when there is no alignment between textual and visual representations of the input. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, using robust and non-robust image classification models, demonstrate that Multi-Shield can be easily integrated to detect and reject adversarial examples, outperforming the original defenses.|Francesco Villani et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10353)|null|

Although research on these molecules has profoundly impacted fields like medicine, agriculture, and industry, the diversity of machine learning approaches-from traditional statistical methods to deep learning models and large language models-poses challenges for researchers in choosing the most suitable models for specific tasks, especially for cross-omics and multi-omics tasks due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To address this, we introduce the first comprehensive multi-omics benchmark COMET (Benchmark for Biological COmprehensive Multi-omics Evaluation Tasks and Language Models), designed to evaluate models across single-omics, cross-omics, and multi-omics tasks. First, we curate and develop a diverse collection of downstream tasks and datasets covering key structural and functional aspects in DNA, RNA, and proteins, including tasks that span multiple omics levels. Then, we evaluate existing foundational language models for DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as the newly proposed multi-omics method, offering valuable insights into their performance in integrating and analyzing data from different biological modalities. This benchmark aims to define critical issues in multi-omics research and guide future directions, ultimately promoting advancements in understanding biological processes through integrated and different omics data analysis.|Yuchen Ren et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10347)|null|
|**2024-12-13**|**Iris: Breaking GUI Complexity with Adaptive Focus and Self-Refining**|Digital agents are increasingly employed to automate tasks in interactive digital environments such as web pages, software applications, and operating systems. While text-based agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often require frequent updates due to platform-specific APIs, visual agents leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer enhanced adaptability by interacting directly with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). However, these agents face significant challenges in visual perception, particularly when handling high-resolution, visually complex digital environments. This paper introduces Iris, a foundational visual agent that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: Information-Sensitive Cropping (ISC) and Self-Refining Dual Learning (SRDL). ISC dynamically identifies and prioritizes visually dense regions using a edge detection algorithm, enabling efficient processing by allocating more computational resources to areas with higher information density. SRDL enhances the agent's ability to handle complex tasks by leveraging a dual-learning loop, where improvements in referring (describing UI elements) reinforce grounding (locating elements) and vice versa, all without requiring additional annotated data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Iris achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with only 850K GUI annotations, outperforming methods using 10x more training data. These improvements further translate to significant gains in both web and OS agent downstream tasks.|Zhiqi Ge et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10342)|null|
|**2024-12-13**|**AdvPrefix: An Objective for Nuanced LLM Jailbreaks**|Many jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs) rely on a common objective: making the model respond with the prefix "Sure, here is (harmful request)". While straightforward, this objective has two limitations: limited control over model behaviors, often resulting in incomplete or unrealistic responses, and a rigid format that hinders optimization. To address these limitations, we introduce AdvPrefix, a new prefix-forcing objective that enables more nuanced control over model behavior while being easy to optimize. Our objective leverages model-dependent prefixes, automatically selected based on two criteria: high prefilling attack success rates and low negative log-likelihood. It can further simplify optimization by using multiple prefixes for a single user request. AdvPrefix can integrate seamlessly into existing jailbreak attacks to improve their performance for free. For example, simply replacing GCG attack's target prefixes with ours on Llama-3 improves nuanced attack success rates from 14% to 80%, suggesting that current alignment struggles to generalize to unseen prefixes. Our work demonstrates the importance of jailbreak objectives in achieving nuanced jailbreaks.|Sicheng Zhu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10321)|null|
|**2024-12-13**|**SCBench: A KV Cache-Centric Analysis of Long-Context Methods**|Long-context LLMs have enabled numerous downstream applications but also introduced significant challenges related to computational and memory efficiency. To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context inference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing benchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of the KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging 12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric analysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear RNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention, KV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression. The evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that sub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly. Dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong performance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in long-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench.|Yucheng Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10319)|null|

However, current inversion-based approaches struggle with big modifications (e.g., adding or removing objects) due to the structured nature of inversion noise, which hinders substantial changes. Meanwhile, instruction-based methods often constrain users to black-box operations, limiting direct interaction for specifying editing regions and intensity. To address these limitations, we propose BrushEdit, a novel inpainting-based instruction-guided image editing paradigm, which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image inpainting models to enable autonomous, user-friendly, and interactive free-form instruction editing. Specifically, we devise a system enabling free-form instruction editing by integrating MLLMs and a dual-branch image inpainting model in an agent-cooperative framework to perform editing category classification, main object identification, mask acquisition, and editing area inpainting. Extensive experiments show that our framework effectively combines MLLMs and inpainting models, achieving superior performance across seven metrics including mask region preservation and editing effect coherence.|Yaowei Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10316)|null|

However, this focus often neglects whether machine-generated language matches the human level of diversity, in terms of vocabulary choice, syntactic construction, and expression of meaning, raising questions about whether the fundamentals of language generation have been fully addressed. This paper emphasizes the importance of examining the preservation of human linguistic richness by language models, given the concerning surge in online content produced or aided by LLMs. We propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLMs from various linguistic diversity perspectives including lexical, syntactic, and semantic dimensions. Using this framework, we benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs across all diversity dimensions, and conduct an in-depth case study for syntactic diversity. Finally, we analyze how different development and deployment choices impact the linguistic diversity of LLM outputs.|Yanzhu Guo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10271)|**[link](https://github.com/yanzhuguo/llm-diversity)**|
|**2024-12-12**|**EasyRef: Omni-Generalized Group Image Reference for Diffusion Models via Multimodal LLM**|Significant achievements in personalization of diffusion models have been witnessed. Conventional tuning-free methods mostly encode multiple reference images by averaging their image embeddings as the injection condition, but such an image-independent operation cannot perform interaction among images to capture consistent visual elements within multiple references. Although the tuning-based Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively extract consistent elements within multiple images through the training process, it necessitates specific finetuning for each distinct image group. This paper introduces EasyRef, a novel plug-and-play adaptation method that enables diffusion models to be conditioned on multiple reference images and the text prompt. To effectively exploit consistent visual elements within multiple images, we leverage the multi-image comprehension and instruction-following capabilities of the multimodal large language model (MLLM), prompting it to capture consistent visual elements based on the instruction. Besides, injecting the MLLM's representations into the diffusion process through adapters can easily generalize to unseen domains, mining the consistent visual elements within unseen data. To mitigate computational costs and enhance fine-grained detail preservation, we introduce an efficient reference aggregation strategy and a progressive training scheme. Finally, we introduce MRBench, a new multi-reference image generation benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate EasyRef surpasses both tuning-free methods like IP-Adapter and tuning-based methods like LoRA, achieving superior aesthetic quality and robust zero-shot generalization across diverse domains.|Zhuofan Zong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09618)|null|

Our system dynamically retrieves detailed character information and relational data from the knowledge graph, enabling the generation of visually accurate and contextually rich images. This capability significantly improves upon the limitations of existing T2I models, which often struggle with the accurate depiction of complex or culturally specific subjects due to dataset constraints. Furthermore, we propose a novel self-correcting mechanism for text-to-image models to ensure consistency and fidelity in visual outputs, leveraging the rich context from the graph to guide corrections.

Recent efforts to develop unified Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate these capabilities have shown promising results. However, existing approaches often involve complex designs in model architecture or training pipeline, increasing the difficulty of model training and scaling. In this paper, we propose SynerGen-VL, a simple yet powerful encoder-free MLLM capable of both image understanding and generation. To address challenges identified in existing encoder-free unified MLLMs, we introduce the token folding mechanism and the vision-expert-based progressive alignment pretraining strategy, which effectively support high-resolution image understanding while reducing training complexity. After being trained on large-scale mixed image-text data with a unified next-token prediction objective, SynerGen-VL achieves or surpasses the performance of existing encoder-free unified MLLMs with comparable or smaller parameter sizes, and narrows the gap with task-specific state-of-the-art models, highlighting a promising path toward future unified MLLMs. Our code and models shall be released.|Hao Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09604)|null|
|**2024-12-12**|**Do Multimodal Large Language Models See Like Humans?**|Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, leveraging recent advancements in large language models. However, a critical question remains unaddressed: do MLLMs perceive visual information similarly to humans? Current benchmarks lack the ability to evaluate MLLMs from this perspective. To address this challenge, we introduce HVSBench, a large-scale benchmark designed to assess the alignment between MLLMs and the human visual system (HVS) on fundamental vision tasks that mirror human vision. HVSBench curated over 85K multimodal samples, spanning 13 categories and 5 fields in HVS, including Prominence, Subitizing, Prioritizing, Free-Viewing, and Searching. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in providing a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs. Specifically, we evaluate 13 MLLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. Our experiments reveal that HVSBench presents a new and significant challenge for cutting-edge MLLMs. We believe that HVSBench will facilitate research on human-aligned and explainable MLLMs, marking a key step in understanding how MLLMs perceive and process visual information.|Jiaying Lin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09603)|null|
|**2024-12-12**|**TimeRefine: Temporal Grounding with Time Refining Video LLM**|Video temporal grounding aims to localize relevant temporal boundaries in a video given a textual prompt. Recent work has focused on enabling Video LLMs to perform video temporal grounding via next-token prediction of temporal timestamps. However, accurately localizing timestamps in videos remains challenging for Video LLMs when relying solely on temporal token prediction. Our proposed TimeRefine addresses this challenge in two ways. First, instead of directly predicting the start and end timestamps, we reformulate the temporal grounding task as a temporal refining task: the model first makes rough predictions and then refines them by predicting offsets to the target segment. This refining process is repeated multiple times, through which the model progressively self-improves its temporal localization accuracy. Second, to enhance the model's temporal perception capabilities, we incorporate an auxiliary prediction head that penalizes the model more if a predicted segment deviates further from the ground truth, thus encouraging the model to make closer and more accurate predictions. Our plug-and-play method can be integrated into most LLM-based temporal grounding approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeRefine achieves 3.6% and 5.0% mIoU improvements on the ActivityNet and Charades-STA datasets, respectively. Code and pretrained models will be released.|Xizi Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09601)|null|
|**2024-12-12**|**InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive: A Comprehensive Multimodal System for Long-term Streaming Video and Audio Interactions**|Creating AI systems that can interact with environments over long periods, similar to human cognition, has been a longstanding research goal. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in open-world understanding. However, the challenge of continuous and simultaneous streaming perception, memory, and reasoning remains largely unexplored. Current MLLMs are constrained by their sequence-to-sequence architecture, which limits their ability to process inputs and generate responses simultaneously, akin to being unable to think while perceiving. Furthermore, relying on long contexts to store historical data is impractical for long-term interactions, as retaining all information becomes costly and inefficient. Therefore, rather than relying on a single foundation model to perform all functions, this project draws inspiration from the concept of the Specialized Generalist AI and introduces disentangled streaming perception, reasoning, and memory mechanisms, enabling real-time interaction with streaming video and audio input. The proposed framework InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive (IXC2.5-OL) consists of three key modules: (1) Streaming Perception Module: Processes multimodal information in real-time, storing key details in memory and triggering reasoning in response to user queries. (2) Multi-modal Long Memory Module: Integrates short-term and long-term memory, compressing short-term memories into long-term ones for efficient retrieval and improved accuracy. (3) Reasoning Module: Responds to queries and executes reasoning tasks, coordinating with the perception and memory modules. This project simulates human-like cognition, enabling multimodal large language models to provide continuous and adaptive service over time.|Pan Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09596)|**[link](https://github.com/internlm/internlm-xcomposer)**|
|**2024-12-12**|**OLA-VLM: Elevating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs with Auxiliary Embedding Distillation**|The standard practice for developing contemporary MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. In this work, we posit an overlooked opportunity to optimize the intermediate LLM representations through a vision perspective (objective), i.e., solely natural language supervision is sub-optimal for the MLLM's visual understanding ability. To that end, we propose OLA-VLM, the first approach distilling knowledge into the LLM's hidden representations from a set of target visual representations. Firstly, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next text-token prediction. Secondly, we investigate MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Moreover, upon probing our OLA-VLM, we observe improved representation quality owing to the embedding optimization. Thirdly, we demonstrate that our OLA-VLM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. Particularly, OLA-VLM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.

|**2024-12-12**|**Neptune: The Long Orbit to Benchmarking Long Video Understanding**|This paper describes a semi-automatic pipeline to generate challenging question-answer-decoy sets for understanding long videos. Many existing video datasets and models are focused on short clips (10s-30s). While some long video datasets do exist, they can often be solved by powerful image models applied per frame (and often to very few frames) in a video, and are usually manually annotated at high cost. In order to mitigate both these problems, we propose a scalable dataset creation pipeline which leverages large models (VLMs and LLMs), to automatically generate dense, time-aligned video captions, as well as tough question answer decoy sets for video segments (up to 15 minutes in length). Our dataset Neptune covers a broad range of long video reasoning abilities and consists of a subset that emphasizes multimodal reasoning. Since existing metrics for open-ended question answering are either rule-based or may rely on proprietary models, we provide a new open source model-based metric GEM to score open-ended responses on Neptune. Benchmark evaluations reveal that most current open-source long video models perform poorly on Neptune, particularly on questions testing temporal ordering, counting and state changes. Through Neptune, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of understanding long videos.

|**2024-12-12**|**DiverseAgentEntropy: Quantifying Black-Box LLM Uncertainty through Diverse Perspectives and Multi-Agent Interaction**|Quantifying the uncertainty in the factual parametric knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in a black-box setting, poses a significant challenge. Existing methods, which gauge a model's uncertainty through evaluating self-consistency in responses to the original query, do not always capture true uncertainty. Models might respond consistently to the origin query with a wrong answer, yet respond correctly to varied questions from different perspectives about the same query, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, DiverseAgentEntropy, for evaluating a model's uncertainty using multi-agent interaction under the assumption that if a model is certain, it should consistently recall the answer to the original query across a diverse collection of questions about the same original query. We further implement an abstention policy to withhold responses when uncertainty is high. Our method offers a more accurate prediction of the model's reliability and further detects hallucinations, outperforming other self-consistency-based methods. Additionally, it demonstrates that existing models often fail to consistently retrieve the correct answer to the same query under diverse varied questions even when knowing the correct answer.|Yu Feng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09572)|null|
|**2024-12-11**|**Generative Semantic Communication: Architectures, Technologies, and Applications**|This paper delves into the applications of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in semantic communication (SemCom) and presents a thorough study. Three popular SemCom systems enabled by classical GAI models are first introduced, including variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. For each system, the fundamental concept of the GAI model, the corresponding SemCom architecture, and the associated literature review of recent efforts are elucidated. Then, a novel generative SemCom system is proposed by incorporating the cutting-edge GAI technology-large language models (LLMs). This system features two LLM-based AI agents at both the transmitter and receiver, serving as "brains" to enable powerful information understanding and content regeneration capabilities, respectively. This innovative design allows the receiver to directly generate the desired content, instead of recovering the bit stream, based on the coded semantic information conveyed by the transmitter. Therefore, it shifts the communication mindset from "information recovery" to "information regeneration" and thus ushers in a new era of generative SemCom. A case study on point-to-point video retrieval is presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed generative SemCom system, showcasing a 99.98% reduction in communication overhead and a 53% improvement in retrieval accuracy compared to the traditional communication system. Furthermore, four typical application scenarios for generative SemCom are delineated, followed by a discussion of three open issues warranting future investigation. In a nutshell, this paper provides a holistic set of guidelines for applying GAI in SemCom, paving the way for the efficient implementation of generative SemCom in future wireless networks.|Jinke Ren et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08642)|null|
|**2024-12-11**|**Fast Prompt Alignment for Text-to-Image Generation**|Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly, yet aligning complex textual prompts with generated visuals remains challenging, especially with intricate object relationships and fine-grained details. This paper introduces Fast Prompt Alignment (FPA), a prompt optimization framework that leverages a one-pass approach, enhancing text-to-image alignment efficiency without the iterative overhead typical of current methods like OPT2I. FPA uses large language models (LLMs) for single-iteration prompt paraphrasing, followed by fine-tuning or in-context learning with optimized prompts to enable real-time inference, reducing computational demands while preserving alignment fidelity. Extensive evaluations on the COCO Captions and PartiPrompts datasets demonstrate that FPA achieves competitive text-image alignment scores at a fraction of the processing time, as validated through both automated metrics (TIFA, VQA) and human evaluation. A human study with expert annotators further reveals a strong correlation between human alignment judgments and automated scores, underscoring the robustness of FPA's improvements. The proposed method showcases a scalable, efficient alternative to iterative prompt optimization, enabling broader applicability in real-time, high-demand settings.

|**2024-12-11**|**Multimodal Latent Language Modeling with Next-Token Diffusion**|Multimodal generative models require a unified approach to handle both discrete data (e.g., text and code) and continuous data (e.g., image, audio, video). In this work, we propose Latent Language Modeling (LatentLM), which seamlessly integrates continuous and discrete data using causal Transformers. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to represent continuous data as latent vectors and introduce next-token diffusion for autoregressive generation of these vectors. Additionally, we develop $\sigma$ -VAE to address the challenges of variance collapse, which is crucial for autoregressive modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LatentLM across various modalities. In image generation, LatentLM surpasses Diffusion Transformers in both performance and scalability. When integrated into multimodal large language models, LatentLM provides a general-purpose interface that unifies multimodal generation and understanding. Experimental results show that LatentLM achieves favorable performance compared to Transfusion and vector quantized models in the setting of scaling up training tokens. In text-to-speech synthesis, LatentLM outperforms the state-of-the-art VALL-E 2 model in speaker similarity and robustness, while requiring 10x fewer decoding steps. The results establish LatentLM as a highly effective and scalable approach to advance large multimodal models.|Yutao Sun et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08635)|null|

In this work, we propose two methods to enhance VLMs' physical reasoning capabilities using simulated data. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained VLM using question-answer (QA) pairs generated from simulations relevant to physical reasoning tasks. Second, we introduce Physics Context Builders (PCBs), specialized VLMs fine-tuned to create scene descriptions enriched with physical properties and processes. During physical reasoning tasks, these PCBs can be leveraged as context to assist a Large Language Model (LLM) to improve its performance. We evaluate both of our approaches using multiple benchmarks, including a new stability detection QA dataset called Falling Tower, which includes both simulated and real-world scenes, and CLEVRER. We demonstrate that a small QA fine-tuned VLM can significantly outperform larger state-of-the-art foundational models. We also show that integrating PCBs boosts the performance of foundational LLMs on physical reasoning tasks. Using the real-world scenes from the Falling Tower dataset, we also validate the robustness of both approaches in Sim2Real transfer. Our results highlight the utility that simulated data can have in the creation of learning systems capable of advanced physical reasoning.|Vahid Balazadeh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08619)|null|
|**2024-12-11**|**Exploiting the Index Gradients for Optimization-Based Jailbreaking on Large Language Models**|Despite the advancements in training Large Language Models (LLMs) with alignment techniques to enhance the safety of generated content, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak, an adversarial attack method that exposes security vulnerabilities in LLMs. Notably, the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) method has demonstrated the ability to automatically generate adversarial suffixes that jailbreak state-of-the-art LLMs. However, the optimization process involved in GCG is highly time-consuming, rendering the jailbreaking pipeline inefficient. In this paper, we investigate the process of GCG and identify an issue of Indirect Effect, the key bottleneck of the GCG optimization. To this end, we propose the Model Attack Gradient Index GCG (MAGIC), that addresses the Indirect Effect by exploiting the gradient information of the suffix tokens, thereby accelerating the procedure by having less computation and fewer iterations. Our experiments on AdvBench show that MAGIC achieves up to a 1.5x speedup, while maintaining Attack Success Rates (ASR) on par or even higher than other baselines.

To achieve this, they often incorporate auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and auxiliary tasks, like predicting user preferences and intent. Despite numerous efforts to enhance these models, they still suffer from limited personalization. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm, which we term preference discerning. In preference dscerning, we explicitly condition a generative sequential recommendation system on user preferences within its context. To this end, we generate user preferences using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on user reviews and item-specific data. To evaluate preference discerning capabilities of sequential recommendation systems, we introduce a novel benchmark that provides a holistic evaluation across various scenarios, including preference steering and sentiment following. We assess current state-of-the-art methods using our benchmark and show that they struggle to accurately discern user preferences. Therefore, we propose a new method named Mender ( $\textbf{M}$ultimodal Prefer$\textbf{en}$ce $\textbf{d}$iscern$\textbf{er}$ ), which improves upon existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on our benchmark. Our results show that Mender can be effectively guided by human preferences even though they have not been observed during training, paving the way toward more personalized sequential recommendation systems.

We empirically measured the instantaneous power draw of an 8-GPU NVIDIA H100 HGX node during the training of open-source image classifier (ResNet) and large-language models (Llama2-13b). The maximum observed power draw was approximately 8.4 kW, 18% lower than the manufacturer-rated 10.2 kW, even with GPUs near full utilization. Holding model architecture constant, increasing batch size from 512 to 4096 images for ResNet reduced total training energy consumption by a factor of 4.

In these domains, maintaining consistency, adhering to regulatory frameworks, minimizing errors, and meeting critical expectations are essential for the reliable functioning of systems. The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights their immense potential, yet there remains considerable scope for improvement in retrieving relevant information and enhancing reasoning capabilities. This study demonstrates that integrating a robust Graph-RAG framework with advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought, can significantly enhance performance. Compared to baseline RAG methods and simple prompting strategies, this approach delivers more accurate and context-aware results. While this method demonstrates significant improvements in performance, it comes with challenges. It is both costly and more complex to implement across diverse contexts, requiring careful adaptation to specific scenarios. Additionally, its effectiveness heavily relies on having complete and accurate input data, which may not always be readily available, posing further limitations to its scalability and practicality.|Arsalan Masoudifard et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08593)|null|

However, there is a lack of systematic studies comparing the performance of encoder-based models and LLMs in text classification, particularly when fine-tuning is involved. This study employed a diverse range of models and methods, varying in size and architecture, and including both fine-tuned and pre-trained approaches. We first assessed the performances of these LLMs on the 20 Newsgroups (20NG) and MASSIVE datasets, comparing them to encoder-only RoBERTa models. Additionally, we explored the multi-task capabilities of both model types by combining multiple classification tasks, including intent detection and slot-filling, into a single model using data from both datasets. Our results indicate that fully fine-tuned Llama3-70B models outperform RoBERTa-large and other decoder LLMs across various classification tasks and datasets. Moreover, the consolidated multi-task fine-tuned LLMs matched the performance of dual-model setups in both tasks across both datasets. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive benchmark of encoder-only and LLM models on text classification tasks and demonstrates a method to combine two or more fully fine-tuned decoder LLMs for reduced latency and equivalent performance.|Hang Zhao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08587)|null|

While techniques, such as quantization and acceleration algorithms, like FlashAttention, have improved efficiency of the overall inference, they address different aspects of the problem: quantization focuses on weight-activation operations, while FlashAttention improves execution but requires high-precision formats. Recent Key-value (KV) cache quantization reduces memory bandwidth but still needs floating-point dequantization for attention operation.   We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency. Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention. Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.|Hao Kang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08585)|null|

Proposed mutations can be informed by previous measurements or by learning from large antibody databases to predict only typical antibodies. Unfortunately, the space of typical antibodies is enormous to search, and experiments often fail to find suitable antibodies on a budget. We introduce Clone-informed Bayesian Optimization (CloneBO), a Bayesian optimization procedure that efficiently optimizes antibodies in the lab by teaching a generative model how our immune system optimizes antibodies. Our immune system makes antibodies by iteratively evolving specific portions of their sequences to bind their target strongly and stably, resulting in a set of related, evolving sequences known as a clonal family. We train a large language model, CloneLM, on hundreds of thousands of clonal families and use it to design sequences with mutations that are most likely to optimize an antibody within the human immune system. We propose to guide our designs to fit previous measurements with a twisted sequential Monte Carlo procedure. We show that CloneBO optimizes antibodies substantially more efficiently than previous methods in realistic in silico experiments and designs stronger and more stable binders in in vitro wet lab experiments.|Alan Nawzad Amin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07763)|**[link](https://github.com/alannawzadamin/clonebo)**|

|**2024-12-10**|**Privacy-Preserving Customer Support: A Framework for Secure and Scalable Interactions**|The growing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) in customer support has significantly improved operational efficiency and user experience. However, traditional machine learning (ML) approaches, which require extensive local training on sensitive datasets, pose substantial privacy risks and compliance challenges with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Existing privacy-preserving techniques, such as anonymization, differential privacy, and federated learning, address some concerns but face limitations in utility, scalability, and complexity. This paper introduces the Privacy-Preserving Zero-Shot Learning (PP-ZSL) framework, a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot learning mode. Unlike conventional ML methods, PP-ZSL eliminates the need for local training on sensitive data by utilizing pre-trained LLMs to generate responses directly. The framework incorporates real-time data anonymization to redact or mask sensitive information, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for domain-specific query resolution, and robust post-processing to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. This combination reduces privacy risks, simplifies compliance, and enhances scalability and operational efficiency. Empirical analysis demonstrates that the PP-ZSL framework provides accurate, privacy-compliant responses while significantly lowering the costs and complexities of deploying AI-driven customer support systems. The study highlights potential applications across industries, including financial services, healthcare, e-commerce, legal support, telecommunications, and government services. By addressing the dual challenges of privacy and performance, this framework establishes a foundation for secure, efficient, and regulatory-compliant AI applications in customer interactions.|Anant Prakash Awasthi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07687)|null|
|**2024-12-10**|**TRIM: Token Reduction and Inference Modeling for Cost-Effective Language Generation**|The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a significant challenge due to their computational demands, specially on tasks requiring long outputs. However, natural language often contains redundancy, which presents an opportunity for optimization. We have observed that LLMs can generate distilled language-concise outputs that retain essential meaning, when prompted appropriately. We propose a framework for saving computational cost, in which a shorter distilled output from the LLM is reconstructed into a full narrative by a smaller model with lower inference costs. Our experiments show promising results, particularly in general knowledge domains with 20.58% saved tokens on average with tiny decrease in evaluation metrics, hinting that this approach can effectively balance efficiency and accuracy in language processing tasks.|Alfredo Garrachón Ruiz et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07682)|null|
|**2024-12-10**|**RAZOR: Sharpening Knowledge by Cutting Bias with Unsupervised Text Rewriting**|Despite the widespread use of LLMs due to their superior performance in various tasks, their high computational costs often lead potential users to opt for the pretraining-finetuning pipeline. However, biases prevalent in manually constructed datasets can introduce spurious correlations between tokens and labels, creating so-called shortcuts and hindering the generalizability of fine-tuned models. Existing debiasing methods often rely on prior knowledge of specific dataset biases, which is challenging to acquire a priori. We propose RAZOR (Rewriting And Zero-bias Optimization Refinement), a novel, unsupervised, and data-focused debiasing approach based on text rewriting for shortcut mitigation. RAZOR leverages LLMs to iteratively rewrite potentially biased text segments by replacing them with heuristically selected alternatives in a shortcut space defined by token statistics and positional information. This process aims to align surface-level text features more closely with diverse label distributions, thereby promoting the learning of genuine linguistic patterns. Compared with unsupervised SoTA models, RAZOR improves by 3.5% on the FEVER and 6.5% on MNLI and SNLI datasets according to the F1 score. Additionally, RAZOR effectively mitigates specific known biases, reducing bias-related terms by x2 without requiring prior bias information, a result that is on par with SoTA models that leverage prior information. Our work prioritizes data manipulation over architectural modifications, emphasizing the pivotal role of data quality in enhancing model performance and fairness. This research contributes to developing more robust evaluation benchmarks for debiasing methods by incorporating metrics for bias reduction and overall model efficacy.|Shuo Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07675)|null|

Exploring Their Roles in Visualization Troubleshooting**|Visualization authoring is an iterative process requiring users to modify parameters like color schemes and data transformations to achieve desired aesthetics and effectively convey insights. Due to the complexity of these adjustments, users often create defective visualizations and require troubleshooting support. In this paper, we examine two primary approaches for visualization troubleshooting: (1) Human-assisted support via forums, where users receive advice from other individuals, and (2) AI-assisted support using large language models (LLMs). Our goal is to understand the strengths and limitations of each approach in supporting visualization troubleshooting tasks. To this end, we collected 889 Vega-Lite cases from Stack Overflow. We then conducted a comprehensive analysis to understand the types of questions users ask, the effectiveness of human and AI guidance, and the impact of supplementary resources, such as documentation and examples, on troubleshooting outcomes. Our findings reveal a striking contrast between human- and AI-assisted troubleshooting: Human-assisted troubleshooting provides tailored, context-sensitive advice but often varies in response quality, while AI-assisted troubleshooting offers rapid feedback but often requires additional contextual resources to achieve desired results.|Shuyu Shen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07673)|null|
|**2024-12-10**|**FlexLLM: Exploring LLM Customization for Moving Target Defense on Black-Box LLMs Against Jailbreak Attacks**|Defense in large language models (LLMs) is crucial to counter the numerous attackers exploiting these systems to generate harmful content through manipulated prompts, known as jailbreak attacks. Although many defense strategies have been proposed, they often require access to the model's internal structure or need additional training, which is impractical for service providers using LLM APIs, such as OpenAI APIs or Claude APIs. In this paper, we propose a moving target defense approach that alters decoding hyperparameters to enhance model robustness against various jailbreak attacks. Our approach does not require access to the model's internal structure and incurs no additional training costs. The proposed defense includes two key components: (1) optimizing the decoding strategy by identifying and adjusting decoding hyperparameters that influence token generation probabilities, and (2) transforming the decoding hyperparameters and model system prompts into dynamic targets, which are continuously altered during each runtime. By continuously modifying decoding strategies and prompts, the defense effectively mitigates the existing attacks. Our results demonstrate that our defense is the most effective against jailbreak attacks in three of the models tested when using LLMs as black-box APIs. Moreover, our defense offers lower inference costs and maintains comparable response quality, making it a potential layer of protection when used alongside other defense methods.|Bocheng Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07672)|null|
|**2024-12-09**|**Retrieving Semantics from the Deep: an RAG Solution for Gesture Synthesis**|Non-verbal communication often comprises of semantically rich gestures that help convey the meaning of an utterance. Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches. The reader is urged to explore the results on our project page.|M.

|**2024-12-09**|**Training Large Language Models to Reason in a Continuous Latent Space**|Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the "language space", where they typically express the reasoning process with a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem. However, we argue that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed "continuous thought"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space. Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several reasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent advanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical reasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with fewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.|Shibo Hao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769)|null|
|**2024-12-09**|**Why Do Developers Engage with ChatGPT in Issue-Tracker? Investigating Usage and Reliance on ChatGPT-Generated Code**|Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown the potential to assist developers with coding and debugging tasks. However, their role in collaborative issue resolution is underexplored. In this study, we analyzed 1,152 Developer-ChatGPT conversations across 1,012 issues in GitHub to examine the diverse usage of ChatGPT and reliance on its generated code. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we manually analyzed 289 conversations to understand ChatGPT's usage in the GitHub Issues. Our analysis revealed that ChatGPT is primarily utilized for ideation, whereas its usage for validation (e.g., code documentation accuracy) is minimal. Second, we applied BERTopic modeling to identify key areas of engagement on the entire dataset. We found that backend issues (e.g., API management) dominate conversations, while testing is surprisingly less covered. Third, we utilized the CPD clone detection tool to check if the code generated by ChatGPT was used to address issues. Our findings revealed that ChatGPT-generated code was used as-is to resolve only 5.83\% of the issues. Fourth, we estimated sentiment using a RoBERTa-based sentiment analysis model to determine developers' satisfaction with different usages and engagement areas. We found positive sentiment (i.e., high satisfaction) about using ChatGPT for refactoring and addressing data analytics (e.g., categorizing table data) issues. On the contrary, we observed negative sentiment when using ChatGPT to debug issues and address automation tasks (e.g., GUI interactions). Our findings show the unmet needs and growing dissatisfaction among developers. Researchers and ChatGPT developers should focus on developing task-specific solutions that help resolve diverse issues, improving user satisfaction and problem-solving efficiency in software development.|Joy Krishan Das et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06757)|null|
|**2024-12-09**|**Refusal Tokens: A Simple Way to Calibrate Refusals in Large Language Models**|A key component of building safe and reliable language models is enabling the models to appropriately refuse to follow certain instructions or answer certain questions. We may want models to output refusal messages for various categories of user queries, for example, ill-posed questions, instructions for committing illegal acts, or queries which require information past the model's knowledge horizon. Engineering models that refuse to answer such questions is complicated by the fact that an individual may want their model to exhibit varying levels of sensitivity for refusing queries of various categories, and different users may want different refusal rates. The current default approach involves training multiple models with varying proportions of refusal messages from each category to achieve the desired refusal rates, which is computationally expensive and may require training a new model to accommodate each user's desired preference over refusal rates. To address these challenges, we propose refusal tokens, one such token for each refusal category or a single refusal token, which are prepended to the model's responses during training. We then show how to increase or decrease the probability of generating the refusal token for each category during inference to steer the model's refusal behavior. Refusal tokens enable controlling a single model's refusal rates without the need of any further fine-tuning, but only by selectively intervening during generation.|Neel Jain et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06748)|null|
|**2024-12-09**|**ONEBench to Test Them All: Sample-Level Benchmarking Over Open-Ended Capabilities**|Traditional fixed test sets fall short in evaluating open-ended capabilities of foundation models. To address this, we propose ONEBench(OpeN-Ended Benchmarking), a new testing paradigm that consolidates individual evaluation datasets into a unified, ever-expanding sample pool. ONEBench allows users to generate custom, open-ended evaluation benchmarks from this pool, corresponding to specific capabilities of interest. By aggregating samples across test sets, ONEBench enables the assessment of diverse capabilities beyond those covered by the original test sets, while mitigating overfitting and dataset bias. Most importantly, it frames model evaluation as a collective process of selecting and aggregating sample-level tests.   The shift from task-specific benchmarks to ONEBench introduces two challenges: (1)heterogeneity and (2)incompleteness. Heterogeneity refers to the aggregation over diverse metrics, while incompleteness describes comparing models evaluated on different data subsets. To address these challenges, we explore algorithms to aggregate sparse measurements into reliable model scores. Our aggregation algorithm ensures identifiability(asymptotically recovering ground-truth scores) and rapid convergence, enabling accurate model ranking with less data. On homogenous datasets, we show our aggregation algorithm provides rankings that highly correlate with those produced by average scores. We also demonstrate robustness to ~95% of measurements missing, reducing evaluation cost by up to 20x with little-to-no change in model rankings. We introduce ONEBench-LLM for language models and ONEBench-LMM for vision-language models, unifying evaluations across these domains. Overall, we present a technique for open-ended evaluation, which can aggregate over incomplete, heterogeneous sample-level measurements to continually grow a benchmark alongside the rapidly developing foundation models.|Adhiraj Ghosh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06745)|null|

However, these studies have predominantly focused on English language tasks. In this paper, we address the fundamental research question: Can LLMs serve as proficient training data generators for other language tasks? Specifically, we leverage LLMs to synthesize supervised training data under few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios across six diverse Japanese downstream tasks. Subsequently, we utilize this synthesized data to train compact models (e.g., BERT). This novel methodology is termed JAPAGEN. Our experimental findings underscore that JAPAGEN achieves robust performance in classification tasks that necessitate formal text inputs, demonstrating competitive results compared to conventional LLM prompting strategies.|Takuro Fujii et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06738)|null|
|**2024-12-09**|**AutoDCWorkflow: LLM-based Data Cleaning Workflow Auto-Generation and Benchmark**|We investigate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for automatically generating data-cleaning workflows. To evaluate LLMs' ability to complete data-cleaning tasks, we implemented a pipeline for LLM-based Auto Data Cleaning Workflow (AutoDCWorkflow), prompting LLMs on data cleaning operations to repair three types of data quality issues: duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent data formats. Given a dirty table and a purpose (expressed as a query), this pipeline generates a minimal, clean table sufficient to address the purpose and the data cleaning workflow used to produce the table. The planning process involves three main LLM-driven components: (1) Select Target Columns: Identifies a set of target columns related to the purpose. (2) Inspect Column Quality: Assesses the data quality for each target column and generates a Data Quality Report as operation objectives. (3) Generate Operation & Arguments: Predicts the next operation and arguments based on the data quality report results. Additionally, we propose a data cleaning benchmark to evaluate the capability of LLM agents to automatically generate workflows that address data cleaning purposes of varying difficulty levels. The benchmark comprises the annotated datasets as a collection of purpose, raw table, clean table, data cleaning workflow, and answer set. In our experiments, we evaluated three LLMs that auto-generate purpose-driven data cleaning workflows. The results indicate that LLMs perform well in planning and generating data-cleaning workflows without the need for fine-tuning.|Lan Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06724)|null|

|**2024-12-09**|**Exploring Critical Testing Scenarios for Decision-Making Policies: An LLM Approach**|Recent years have witnessed surprising achievements of decision-making policies across various fields, such as autonomous driving and robotics. Testing for decision-making policies is crucial with the existence of critical scenarios that may threaten their reliability. Numerous research efforts have been dedicated to testing these policies. However, there are still significant challenges, such as low testing efficiency and diversity due to the complexity of the policies and environments under test. Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs), in this paper, we propose an LLM-driven online testing framework for efficiently testing decision-making policies. The main idea is to employ an LLM-based test scenario generator to intelligently generate challenging test cases through contemplation and reasoning. Specifically, we first design a "generate-test-feedback" pipeline and apply templated prompt engineering to fully leverage the knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Then, we introduce a multi-scale scenario generation strategy to address the inherent challenges LLMs face in making fine adjustments, further enhancing testing efficiency. Finally, we evaluate the LLM-driven approach on five widely used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in uncovering both critical and diverse scenarios.|Weichao Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06684)|null|

However, existing agent-based models still have some limitations on behavioral realism and resource demand that limit their applicability. In this study, leveraging the emerging technology of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, we propose a general LLM-agent-based modeling framework for transportation systems. We argue that LLM agents not only possess the essential capabilities to function as agents but also offer promising solutions to overcome some limitations of existing agent-based models. Our conceptual framework design closely replicates the decision-making and interaction processes and traits of human travelers within transportation networks, and we demonstrate that the proposed systems can meet critical behavioral criteria for decision-making and learning behaviors using related studies and a demonstrative example of LLM agents' learning and adjustment in the bottleneck setting. Although further refinement of the LLM-agent-based modeling framework is necessary, we believe that this approach has the potential to improve transportation system modeling and simulation.|Tianming Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06681)|null|

In this work, we delve into the relationship between model scaling and performance, systematically exploring the performance trends in vision encoders, language models, dataset sizes, and test-time configurations. Through extensive evaluations on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-discipline reasoning, document understanding, multi-image / video understanding, real-world comprehension, multimodal hallucination detection, visual grounding, multilingual capabilities, and pure language processing, InternVL 2.5 exhibits competitive performance, rivaling leading commercial models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Notably, our model is the first open-source MLLMs to surpass 70% on the MMMU benchmark, achieving a 3.7-point improvement through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and showcasing strong potential for test-time scaling.

|**2024-12-06**|**APOLLO: SGD-like Memory, AdamW-level Performance**|Large language models (LLMs) are notoriously memory-intensive during training, particularly with the popular AdamW optimizer. This memory burden necessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting training scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient optimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they face critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii) significant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still substantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.   In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be effectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this insight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM Optimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an auxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This structured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further memory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even its rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance compared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.   Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with or better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly eliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant system-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB setup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model Scalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without system-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training LLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight quantization.|Hanqing Zhu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05270)|null|

This workflow aims to complement FKG.in and iteratively supplement food composition data from verified knowledge bases. Additionally, this paper highlights the challenges of representing Indian food and accessing food composition data digitally.

Furthermore, it briefly outlines how users can interact with the workflow to obtain diet-based health recommendations and detailed food composition information for numerous recipes. We then explore the complex challenges of analyzing Indian recipe information across dimensions such as structure, multilingualism, and uncertainty as well as present our ongoing work on LLM-based solutions to address these issues.

|**2024-12-06**|**CompCap: Improving Multimodal Large Language Models with Composite Captions**|How well can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand composite images? Composite images (CIs) are synthetic visuals created by merging multiple visual elements, such as charts, posters, or screenshots, rather than being captured directly by a camera. While CIs are prevalent in real-world applications, recent MLLM developments have primarily focused on interpreting natural images (NIs). Our research reveals that current MLLMs face significant challenges in accurately understanding CIs, often struggling to extract information or perform complex reasoning based on these images. We find that existing training data for CIs are mostly formatted for question-answer tasks (e.g., in datasets like ChartQA and ScienceQA), while high-quality image-caption datasets, critical for robust vision-language alignment, are only available for NIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce Composite Captions (CompCap), a flexible framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and automation tools to synthesize CIs with accurate and detailed captions. Using CompCap, we curate CompCap-118K, a dataset containing 118K image-caption pairs across six CI types. We validate the effectiveness of CompCap-118K by supervised fine-tuning MLLMs of three sizes: xGen-MM-inst.-4B and LLaVA-NeXT-Vicuna-7B/13B. Empirical results show that CompCap-118K significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding of CIs, yielding average gains of 1.7%, 2.0%, and 2.9% across eleven benchmarks, respectively.|Xiaohui Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05243)|null|

However, their reasoning capabilities remain constrained by existing instruction-tuning datasets, which were predominately repurposed from academic datasets such as VQA, AI2D, and ChartQA. These datasets target simplistic tasks, and only provide phrase-level answers without any intermediate rationales. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable and cost-effective method to construct a large-scale multimodal instruction-tuning dataset with rich intermediate rationales designed to elicit CoT reasoning. Using only open models, we create a dataset containing 12M instruction-response pairs to cover diverse, reasoning-intensive tasks with detailed and faithful rationales. Experiments demonstrate that training MLLMs on this dataset significantly improves reasoning capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as MathVerse (+8.1%), MMMU-Pro (+7%), and MuirBench (+13.3%). Additionally, the model demonstrates notable improvements of up to 4% on non-reasoning-based benchmarks.

|**2024-12-06**|**LIAR: Leveraging Alignment (Best-of-N) to Jailbreak LLMs in Seconds**|Many existing jailbreak techniques rely on solving discrete combinatorial optimization, while more recent approaches involve training LLMs to generate multiple adversarial prompts. However, both approaches require significant computational resources to produce even a single adversarial prompt. We hypothesize that the inefficiency of current approaches stems from an inadequate characterization of the jailbreak problem. To address this gap, we formulate the jailbreak problem in terms of alignment. By starting from an available safety-aligned model, we leverage an unsafe reward to guide the safe model towards generating unsafe outputs using alignment techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback), effectively performing jailbreaking via alignment. We propose a novel jailbreak method called LIAR (LeveragIng Alignment to jailbReak). To demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of our approach, we employ a best-of-N method to solve the alignment problem. LIAR offers significant advantages: lower computational requirements without additional training, fully black-box operation, competitive attack success rates, and more human-readable prompts. We provide theoretical insights into the possibility of jailbreaking a safety-aligned model, revealing inherent vulnerabilities in current alignment strategies for LLMs. We also provide sub-optimality guarantees for the proposed \algo. Experimentally, we achieve ASR comparable to the SoTA with a 10x improvement to perplexity and a Time-to-Attack measured in seconds rather than tens of hours.|James Beetham et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05232)|null|
|**2024-12-06**|**BEExformer: A Fast Inferencing Transformer Architecture via Binarization with Multiple Early Exits**|Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformers achieve cutting-edge results on a variety of applications. However, their enormous size and processing requirements make deployment on devices with constrained resources extremely difficult. Among various efficiency considerations, model binarization and Early Exit (EE) are common effective solutions. However, binarization may lead to performance loss due to reduced precision affecting gradient estimation and parameter updates. Besides, the present early-exit mechanisms are still in the nascent stages of research. To ameliorate these issues, we propose Binarized Early Exit Transformer (BEExformer), the first-ever selective learning transformer architecture to combine early exit with binarization for textual inference. It improves the binarization process through a differentiable second-order approximation to the impulse function. This enables gradient computation concerning both the sign as well as the magnitude of the weights. In contrast to absolute threshold-based EE, the proposed EE mechanism hinges on fractional reduction in entropy among intermediate transformer blocks with soft-routing loss estimation. While binarization results in 18.44 times reduction in model size, early exit reduces the FLOPs during inference by 54.85% and even improves accuracy by 5.98% through resolving the "overthinking" problem inherent in deep networks. Moreover, the proposed BEExformer simplifies training by not requiring knowledge distillation from a full-precision LLM.

Despite advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, current state-of-the-art methods fail to achieve more than 80% accuracy in generating faithful and factually correct outputs, even when provided with relevant and accurate context. In this work, we introduce Acurai, a novel systematic approach that achieves 100% hallucination-free responses in LLMs by reformatting queries and context data prior to input. Leveraging a deep understanding of LLM internal representations, the importance of noun-phrase dominance, and the role of discrete functional units (DFUs), Acurai ensures alignment between input context and generated output. We validate this method using the RAGTruth corpus, demonstrating its ability to eliminate 100% hallucinations for both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo.

|**2024-12-06**|**Evaluating and Aligning CodeLLMs on Human Preference**|Code large language models (codeLLMs) have made significant strides in code generation. Most previous code-related benchmarks, which consist of various programming exercises along with the corresponding test cases, are used as a common measure to evaluate the performance and capabilities of code LLMs. However, the current code LLMs focus on synthesizing the correct code snippet, ignoring the alignment with human preferences, where the query should be sampled from the practical application scenarios and the model-generated responses should satisfy the human preference. To bridge the gap between the model-generated response and human preference, we present a rigorous human-curated benchmark CodeArena to emulate the complexity and diversity of real-world coding tasks, where 397 high-quality samples spanning 40 categories and 44 programming languages, carefully curated from user queries. Further, we propose a diverse synthetic instruction corpus SynCode-Instruct (nearly 20B tokens) by scaling instructions from the website to verify the effectiveness of the large-scale synthetic instruction fine-tuning, where Qwen2.5-SynCoder totally trained on synthetic instruction data can achieve top-tier performance of open-source code LLMs. The results find performance differences between execution-based benchmarks and CodeArena. Our systematic experiments of CodeArena on 40+ LLMs reveal a notable performance gap between open SOTA code LLMs (e.g. Qwen2.5-Coder) and proprietary LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1), underscoring the importance of the human preference alignment.\footnote{\url{https://codearenaeval.github.io/ }}|Jian Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05210)|null|

|**2024-12-05**|**p-MoD: Building Mixture-of-Depths MLLMs via Progressive Ratio Decay**|Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. The majority of computation stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In this paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks. Our model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline models, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.|Jun Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04449)|**[link](https://github.com/mcg-nju/p-mod)**|

However, achieving AGI necessitates more than just comprehension and reasoning. A crucial capability required is effective planning in diverse scenarios, which involves making reasonable decisions based on complex environments to solve real-world problems. Despite its importance, the planning abilities of current MLLMs in varied scenarios remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce EgoPlan-Bench2, a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the planning capabilities of MLLMs across a wide range of real-world scenarios. EgoPlan-Bench2 encompasses everyday tasks spanning 4 major domains and 24 detailed scenarios, closely aligned with human daily life. EgoPlan-Bench2 is constructed through a semi-automatic process utilizing egocentric videos, complemented by manual verification. Grounded in a first-person perspective, it mirrors the way humans approach problem-solving in everyday life. We evaluate 21 competitive MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their limitations, revealing that they face significant challenges in real-world planning. To further improve the planning proficiency of current MLLMs, we propose a training-free approach using multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting through investigating the effectiveness of various multimodal prompts in complex planning. Our approach enhances the performance of GPT-4V by 10.24 on EgoPlan-Bench2 without additional training. Our work not only sheds light on the current limitations of MLLMs in planning, but also provides insights for future enhancements in this critical area.

|**2024-12-05**|**Moto: Latent Motion Token as the Bridging Language for Robot Manipulation**|Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.|Yi Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04445)|null|
|**2024-12-05**|**Divot: Diffusion Powers Video Tokenizer for Comprehension and Generation**|In recent years, there has been a significant surge of interest in unifying image comprehension and generation within Large Language Models (LLMs). This growing interest has prompted us to explore extending this unification to videos. The core challenge lies in developing a versatile video tokenizer that captures both the spatial characteristics and temporal dynamics of videos to obtain representations for LLMs, and the representations can be further decoded into realistic video clips to enable video generation. In this work, we introduce Divot, a Diffusion-Powered Video Tokenizer, which leverages the diffusion process for self-supervised video representation learning. We posit that if a video diffusion model can effectively de-noise video clips by taking the features of a video tokenizer as the condition, then the tokenizer has successfully captured robust spatial and temporal information. Additionally, the video diffusion model inherently functions as a de-tokenizer, decoding videos from their representations. Building upon the Divot tokenizer, we present Divot-Vicuna through video-to-text autoregression and text-to-video generation by modeling the distributions of continuous-valued Divot features with a Gaussian Mixture Model. Experimental results demonstrate that our diffusion-based video tokenizer, when integrated with a pre-trained LLM, achieves competitive performance across various video comprehension and generation benchmarks. The instruction tuned Divot-Vicuna also excels in video storytelling, generating interleaved narratives and corresponding videos.|Yuying Ge et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04432)|**[link](https://github.com/tencentarc/divot)**|
|**2024-12-05**|**Grounding Descriptions in Images informs Zero-Shot Visual Recognition**|Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have been cherished for their ability to perform zero-shot visual recognition on open-vocabulary concepts. This is achieved by selecting the object category whose textual representation bears the highest similarity with the query image. While successful in some domains, this method struggles with identifying fine-grained entities as well as generalizing to unseen concepts that are not captured by the training distribution. Recent works attempt to mitigate these challenges by integrating category descriptions at test time, albeit yielding modest improvements. We attribute these limited gains to a fundamental misalignment between image and description representations, which is rooted in the pretraining structure of CLIP. In this paper, we propose GRAIN, a new pretraining strategy aimed at aligning representations at both fine and coarse levels simultaneously. Our approach learns to jointly ground textual descriptions in image regions along with aligning overarching captions with global image representations. To drive this pre-training, we leverage frozen Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to derive large-scale synthetic annotations. We demonstrate the enhanced zero-shot performance of our model compared to current state-of-the art methods across 11 diverse image classification datasets. Additionally, we introduce Products-2023, a newly curated, manually labeled dataset featuring novel concepts, and showcase our model's ability to recognize these concepts by benchmarking on it. Significant improvements achieved by our model on other downstream tasks like retrieval further highlight the superior quality of representations learned by our approach.

|**2024-12-05**|**Florence-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Models with Generative Vision Encoder and Depth-Breadth Fusion**|We present Florence-VL, a new family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with enriched visual representations produced by Florence-2, a generative vision foundation model. Unlike the widely used CLIP-style vision transformer trained by contrastive learning, Florence-2 can capture different levels and aspects of visual features, which are more versatile to be adapted to diverse downstream tasks. We propose a novel feature-fusion architecture and an innovative training recipe that effectively integrates Florence-2's visual features into pretrained LLMs, such as Phi 3.5 and LLama 3. In particular, we propose "depth-breath fusion (DBFusion)" to fuse the visual features extracted from different depths and under multiple prompts. Our model training is composed of end-to-end pretraining of the whole model followed by finetuning of the projection layer and the LLM, on a carefully designed recipe of diverse open-source datasets that include high-quality image captions and instruction-tuning pairs. Our quantitative analysis and visualization of Florence-VL's visual features show its advantages over popular vision encoders on vision-language alignment, where the enriched depth and breath play important roles. Florence-VL achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art MLLMs across various multi-modal and vision-centric benchmarks covering general VQA, perception, hallucination, OCR, Chart, knowledge-intensive understanding, etc. To facilitate future research, our models and the complete training recipe are open-sourced. https://github.com/JiuhaiChen/Florence-VL|Jiuhai Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04424)|**[link](https://github.com/jiuhaichen/florence-vl)**|

While these advancements offer immense utility, they also inherit and amplify inherent safety risks such as bias, fairness, hallucinations, privacy breaches, and a lack of transparency. This paper investigates a critical vulnerability: adversarial attacks targeting the LLM core within AI agents. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that a deceptively simple adversarial prefix, such as \textit{Ignore the document}, can compel LLMs to produce dangerous or unintended outputs by bypassing their contextual safeguards. Through experimentation, we demonstrate a high attack success rate (ASR), revealing the fragility of existing LLM defenses. These findings emphasize the urgent need for robust, multi-layered security measures tailored to mitigate vulnerabilities at the LLM level and within broader agent-based architectures.|Xuying Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04415)|null|
|**2024-12-05**|**Discriminative Fine-tuning of LVLMs**|Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have become the de facto approach for discriminative vision-language representation learning. However, these models have limited language understanding, often exhibiting a "bag of words" behavior. At the same time, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which combine vision encoders with LLMs, have been shown capable of detailed vision-language reasoning, yet their autoregressive nature renders them less suitable for discriminative tasks.   In this work, we propose to combine "the best of both worlds": a new training approach for discriminative fine-tuning of LVLMs that results in strong discriminative and compositional capabilities. Essentially, our approach converts a generative LVLM into a discriminative one, unlocking its capability for powerful image-text discrimination combined with enhanced language understanding.   Our contributions include: (1) A carefully designed training/optimization framework that utilizes image-text pairs of variable length and granularity for training the model with both contrastive and next-token prediction losses. This is accompanied by ablation studies that justify the necessity of our framework's components. (2) A parameter-efficient adaptation method using a combination of soft prompting and LoRA adapters. (3) Significant improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-like models of similar size, including standard image-text retrieval benchmarks and notable gains in compositionality.|Yassine Ouali et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04378)|null|

While now standard, it is tricky to implement effective guardrails to collect high-quality annotations from humans. In this paper, we demonstrate that three sources of bad annotations, both malicious and otherwise, can corrupt the reliability of open leaderboard rankings. In particular, we show that only 10\% of poor quality votes by apathetic (site visitors not appropriately incentivized to give correct votes) or adversarial (bad actors seeking to inflate the ranking of a target model) annotators can change the rankings of models by up to 5 places on the leaderboard. Finally, we discuss open challenges in ensuring high-quality human annotations.|Wenting Zhao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04363)|null|

To address this, we propose a simple and effective baseline, RMD, which enhances the generalization of motion generation through retrieval-augmented techniques. Unlike previous retrieval-based methods, RMD requires no additional training and offers three key advantages: (1) the external retrieval database can be flexibly replaced; (2) body parts from the motion database can be reused, with an LLM facilitating splitting and recombination; and (3) a pre-trained motion diffusion model serves as a prior to improve the quality of motions obtained through retrieval and direct combination. Without any training, RMD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with notable advantages on out-of-distribution data.|Zhouyingcheng Liao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04343)|null|

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their potential to simulate human behavior, enabling the replication of individual responses and facilitating studies on many interdisciplinary studies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of this field, illustrating the recent progress in simulation driven by LLM-empowered agents. We categorize the simulations into three types: (1) Individual Simulation, which mimics specific individuals or demographic groups; (2) Scenario Simulation, where multiple agents collaborate to achieve goals within specific contexts; and (3) Society Simulation, which models interactions within agent societies to reflect the complexity and variety of real-world dynamics. These simulations follow a progression, ranging from detailed individual modeling to large-scale societal phenomena. We provide a detailed discussion of each simulation type, including the architecture or key components of the simulation, the classification of objectives or scenarios and the evaluation method. Afterward, we summarize commonly used datasets and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the trends across these three types of simulation.

Although many compelling demonstrations of TUIs exist in the literature, there is a lack of research on TUIs intended for daily two-handed tasks and processes, such as cooking. In response to this gap, we propose SPICE (Smart Projection Interface for Cooking Enhancement). SPICE investigates TUIs in a kitchen setting, aiming to transform the recipe following experience from simply text-based to tangibly interactive. SPICE includes a tracking system, an agent-based software, and vision large language models to create and interpret a kitchen environment where recipe information is projected directly onto the cooking surface. We conducted a comparative usability study of SPICE and text-based recipe following with 30 participants, assessing the task difficulty, total duration, and efficiency, as well as user confidence and taste perception. The results indicate that SPICE allowed participants to perform the recipe with less stops and in shorter time while also improving self-reported efficiency, confidence, and taste. Despite this, participants self-reported no change in overall difficulty, which is a direction for future research. Overall, the SPICE project demonstrates the potential of using TUIs to improve everyday activities, paving the way for future research in HCI and new computing interfaces.|Vera Prohaska et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03551)|null|
|**2024-12-04**|**Evaluating Gender Bias Transfer between Pre-trained and Prompt-Adapted Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adapted to achieve task-specificity for deployment in real-world decision systems. Several previous works have investigated the bias transfer hypothesis (BTH) by studying the effect of the fine-tuning adaptation strategy on model fairness to find that fairness in pre-trained masked language models have limited effect on the fairness of models when adapted using fine-tuning. In this work, we expand the study of BTH to causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an accessible, and compute-efficient way to deploy models in real-world systems. In contrast to previous works, we establish that intrinsic biases in pre-trained Mistral, Falcon and Llama models are strongly correlated (rho >= 0.94) with biases when the same models are zero- and few-shot prompted, using a pronoun co-reference resolution task. Further, we find that bias transfer remains strongly correlated even when LLMs are specifically prompted to exhibit fair or biased behavior (rho >= 0.92), and few-shot length and stereotypical composition are varied (rho >= 0.97). Our findings highlight the importance of ensuring fairness in pre-trained LLMs, especially when they are later used to perform downstream tasks via prompt adaptation.|Natalie Mackraz et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03537)|null|

It plays a key role in the development of educational technology systems and is traditionally rooted in deterministic feedback defined by experts and their experience. However, with the rise of generative AI and especially Large Language Models (LLMs), we expect feedback as part of learning systems to transform, especially for the context of programming. In the past, it was challenging to automate feedback for learners of programming. LLMs may create new possibilities to provide richer, and more individual feedback than ever before.   Objectives: This paper aims to generate specific types of feedback for introductory programming tasks using LLMs. We revisit existing feedback taxonomies to capture the specifics of the generated feedback, such as randomness, uncertainty, and degrees of variation.   Methods: We iteratively designed prompts for the generation of specific feedback types (as part of existing feedback taxonomies) in response to authentic student programs. We then evaluated the generated output and determined to what extent it reflected certain feedback types.   Results and Conclusion: The present work provides a better understanding of different feedback dimensions and characteristics. The results have implications for future feedback research with regard to, for example, feedback effects and learners' informational needs. It further provides a basis for the development of new tools and learning systems for novice programmers including feedback generated by AI.|Dominic Lohr et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03516)|null|

While this process adapts LLMs to multimodal settings, it remains unclear whether this adaptation compromises their original language reasoning capabilities. In this work, we explore the effects of multimodal instruction tuning on language reasoning performance. We focus on LLaVA, a leading multimodal framework that integrates LLMs such as Vicuna or Mistral with the CLIP vision encoder. We compare the performance of the original LLMs with their multimodal-adapted counterparts across eight language reasoning tasks. Our experiments yield several key insights. First, the impact of multimodal learning varies between Vicuna and Mistral: we observe a degradation in language reasoning for Mistral but improvements for Vicuna across most tasks. Second, while multimodal instruction learning consistently degrades performance on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K), it enhances performance on commonsense reasoning tasks (e.g., CommonsenseQA). Finally, we demonstrate that a training-free model merging technique can effectively mitigate the language reasoning degradation observed in multimodal-adapted Mistral and even improve performance on visual tasks.|Neale Ratzlaff et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03467)|null|

This study explores the untapped potential of Common Crawl as a comprehensive and flexible resource for pre-training LLMs, addressing both general-purpose language understanding and specialized domain knowledge. We introduce RedStone, an innovative and scalable pipeline engineered to extract and process data from Common Crawl, facilitating the creation of extensive and varied pre-training datasets. Unlike traditional datasets, which often require expensive curation and domain-specific expertise, RedStone leverages the breadth of Common Crawl to deliver datasets tailored to a wide array of domains. In this work, we exemplify its capability by constructing pre-training datasets across multiple fields, including general language understanding, code, mathematics, and question-answering tasks. The flexibility of RedStone allows for easy adaptation to other specialized domains, significantly lowering the barrier to creating valuable domain-specific datasets. Our findings demonstrate that Common Crawl, when harnessed through effective pipelines like RedStone, can serve as a rich, renewable source of pre-training data, unlocking new avenues for domain adaptation and knowledge discovery in LLMs. This work also underscores the importance of innovative data acquisition strategies and highlights the role of web-scale data as a powerful resource in the continued evolution of LLMs. RedStone code and data samples will be publicly available at \url{https://aka.ms/redstone}.|Yaoyao Chang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03398)|null|

|**2024-12-03**|**T-REG: Preference Optimization with Token-Level Reward Regularization**|Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been crucial in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. Traditionally, RLHF involves generating responses to a query and using a reward model to assign a reward to the entire response. However, this approach faces challenges due to its reliance on a single, sparse reward, which makes it challenging for the model to identify which parts of the sequence contribute most significantly to the final reward. Recent methods have attempted to address this limitation by introducing token-level rewards. However, these methods often rely on either a trained credit assignment model or AI annotators, raising concerns about the quality and reliability of the rewards. In this paper, we propose token-level reward regularization (T-REG), a novel approach that leverages both sequence-level and token-level rewards for preference optimization. Harnessing the self-refinement capabilities of LLMs, our method uses contrastive prompting to enable LLMs to self-generate token-level rewards. These self-generated rewards then act as reward regularization, guiding the model to more effectively distribute sequence-level rewards across tokens. This facilitates better token-level credit assignment and enhances alignment performance. Experiments on the instruction following benchmarks, including Alpaca Eval 2 and Arena-Hard, show that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods by up to 3.8% and 4.4%, respectively.

We explore a framework where the model verifies its own outputs, filters or reweights data based on this verification, and distills the filtered data. Despite several empirical successes, a fundamental understanding is still lacking. In this work, we initiate a comprehensive, modular and controlled study on LLM self-improvement. We provide a mathematical formulation for self-improvement, which is largely governed by a quantity which we formalize as the generation-verification gap. Through experiments with various model families and tasks, we discover a scaling phenomenon of self-improvement -- a variant of the generation-verification gap scales monotonically with the model pre-training flops. We also examine when self-improvement is possible, an iterative self-improvement procedure, and ways to improve its performance. Our findings not only advance understanding of LLM self-improvement with practical implications, but also open numerous avenues for future research into its capabilities and boundaries.|Yuda Song et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02674)|null|

|**2024-12-03**|**Time-Reversal Provides Unsupervised Feedback to LLMs**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to predict in the forward direction of time. However, recent works have shown that prompting these models to look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback. Motivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to think (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that complements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language Models (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on responses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further, to effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and fine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch. We show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that time-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used to score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations. We obtain up to 5\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over the competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity scores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward scoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications such as citation generation and passage retrieval. We next leverage the generative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input safety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative rate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks published on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard.|Yerram Varun et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02626)|null|
|**2024-12-03**|**Improving Dynamic Object Interactions in Text-to-Video Generation with AI Feedback**|Large text-to-video models hold immense potential for a wide range of downstream applications. However, these models struggle to accurately depict dynamic object interactions, often resulting in unrealistic movements and frequent violations of real-world physics. One solution inspired by large language models is to align generated outputs with desired outcomes using external feedback. This enables the model to refine its responses autonomously, eliminating extensive manual data collection. In this work, we investigate the use of feedback to enhance the object dynamics in text-to-video models. We aim to answer a critical question: what types of feedback, paired with which specific self-improvement algorithms, can most effectively improve text-video alignment and realistic object interactions? We begin by deriving a unified probabilistic objective for offline RL finetuning of text-to-video models. This perspective highlights how design elements in existing algorithms like KL regularization and policy projection emerge as specific choices within a unified framework. We then use derived methods to optimize a set of text-video alignment metrics (e.g., CLIP scores, optical flow), but notice that they often fail to align with human perceptions of generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging vision-language models to provide more nuanced feedback specifically tailored to object dynamics in videos. Our experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively optimize a wide variety of rewards, with binary AI feedback driving the most significant improvements in video quality for dynamic interactions, as confirmed by both AI and human evaluations. Notably, we observe substantial gains when using reward signals derived from AI feedback, particularly in scenarios involving complex interactions between multiple objects and realistic depictions of objects falling.|Hiroki Furuta et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02617)|null|

While these models demonstrate impressive performance across a wide range of audio-visual applications, our proposed DeafTest reveals that MLLMs often struggle with simple tasks humans find trivial: 1) determining which of two sounds is louder, and 2) determining which of two sounds has a higher pitch. Motivated by these observations, we introduce AV-Odyssey Bench, a comprehensive audio-visual benchmark designed to assess whether those MLLMs can truly understand the audio-visual information. This benchmark encompasses 4,555 carefully crafted problems, each incorporating text, visual, and audio components. To successfully infer answers, models must effectively leverage clues from both visual and audio inputs. To ensure precise and objective evaluation of MLLM responses, we have structured the questions as multiple-choice, eliminating the need for human evaluation or LLM-assisted assessment. We benchmark a series of closed-source and open-source models and summarize the observations. By revealing the limitations of current models, we aim to provide useful insight for future dataset collection and model development.|Kaixiong Gong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02611)|null|

Practitioners often rely on sector and industry classifications to gauge similarity, such as SIC-codes and GICS-codes, the former being used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the latter widely used by the investment community. Clustering embeddings of company descriptions has been proposed as a potential technique for determining company similarity, but the lack of interpretability in token embeddings poses a significant barrier to adoption in high-stakes contexts. Sparse Autoencoders have shown promise in enhancing the interpretability of Large Language Models by decomposing LLM activations into interpretable features. In this paper, we explore the use of SAE features in measuring company similarity and benchmark them against (1) SIC codes and (2) Major Group codes. We conclude that SAE features can reproduce and even surpass sector classifications in quantifying fundamental characteristics of companies, evaluated by the correlation of monthly returns, a proxy for similarity, and PnL from cointegration.|Marco Molinari et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02605)|null|
|**2024-12-03**|**CEGI: Measuring the trade-off between efficiency and carbon emissions for SLMs and VLMs**|This paper analyzes the performance of Small Language Models (SLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) and evaluates the trade-off between model performance and carbon emissions across 4 essential tasks: Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA), Dialogue Summarization and Text-to-SQL conversion. Various SLMs and VLMs belonging to the Qwen and LLaMA architecture family are chosen and variants based on model size in terms of the number of parameters, quantization level and fine-tuning parameters are evaluated. The model variant's performance and carbon emissions are calculated. To quantify the trade-off between model performance and carbon emissions, we introduce a novel metric called CEGI (Carbon Efficient Gain Index). This metric represents the carbon emission per unit percentage gain per million trainable parameters . This metric provides a normalized measure to compare model's efficiency in terms of performance improvement relative to their environmental cost. The experiment's outcome demonstrates that fine-tuning SLMs and VLMs can achieve performance levels comparable to Large Language Models (LLMs) while producing significantly less carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that the marginal gains in accuracy from larger models do not justify the substantial increase in carbon emissions. Leveraging lower-bit quantization levels, the proposed metric further enhances energy efficiency without compromising performance. This study highlights balancing high performance and environmental sustainability. It offers a valuable metric for selecting models suitable for environmentally-friendly AI development.|Abhas Kumar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02602)|null|

Synthesizing prefix circuits with minimized area and delay is crucial for enhancing the performance of modern computing systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a surprising ability to perform text generation tasks. We propose PrefixLLM, that leverages LLMs for prefix circuit synthesis. PrefixLLM transforms the prefix circuit synthesis task into a structured text generation problem, termed the Structured Prefix Circuit Representation (SPCR), and introduces an iterative framework to automatically and accurately generate valid SPCRs. We further present a design space exploration (DSE) framework that uses LLMs to iteratively search for area and delay optimized prefix circuits. Compared to state-of-the-art, PrefixLLM can reduce the area by 3.70% under the same delay constraint. This work highlights the use of LLMs in the synthesis of arithmetic circuits, which can be transformed into the structured text generation.|Weihua Xiao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02594)|null|
|**2024-12-02**|**T2Vid: Translating Long Text into Multi-Image is the Catalyst for Video-LLMs**|The success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the image domain has garnered wide attention from the research community. Drawing on previous successful experiences, researchers have recently explored extending the success to the video understanding realms. Apart from training from scratch, an efficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two mainstream approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning with video data. In this work, our study of these approaches harvests an effective data augmentation method. We first make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot inference way and identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and lack of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further investigate the fine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all the video data samples, which can be attributed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid to synthesize video-like samples to enrich the instruction diversity in the training corpus. Integrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which achieves performance comparable to or even superior to using full video datasets by training with just 15% the sample size. Meanwhile, we find that the proposed scheme can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video samples. We hope our study will spark more thinking about using MLLMs for video understanding and curation of high-quality data.

|**2024-12-02**|**Critical Tokens Matter: Token-Level Contrastive Estimation Enhances LLM's Reasoning Capability**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance on reasoning tasks. They utilize autoregressive token generation to construct reasoning trajectories, enabling the development of a coherent chain of thought. In this work, we explore the impact of individual tokens on the final outcomes of reasoning tasks. We identify the existence of ``critical tokens'' that lead to incorrect reasoning trajectories in LLMs. Specifically, we find that LLMs tend to produce positive outcomes when forced to decode other tokens instead of critical tokens. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel approach - cDPO - designed to automatically recognize and conduct token-level rewards for the critical tokens during the alignment process. Specifically, we develop a contrastive estimation approach to automatically identify critical tokens. It is achieved by comparing the generation likelihood of positive and negative models. To achieve this, we separately fine-tune the positive and negative models on various reasoning trajectories, consequently, they are capable of identifying identify critical tokens within incorrect trajectories that contribute to erroneous outcomes. Moreover, to further align the model with the critical token information during the alignment process, we extend the conventional DPO algorithms to token-level DPO and utilize the differential likelihood from the aforementioned positive and negative model as important weight for token-level DPO learning.Experimental results on GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks with two-widely used models Llama-3 (8B and 70B) and deepseek-math (7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of the propsoed approach cDPO.|Zicheng Lin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19943)|null|
|**2024-11-29**|**VLSBench: Unveiling Visual Leakage in Multimodal Safety**|Safety concerns of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gradually become an important problem in various applications. Surprisingly, previous works indicate a counter-intuitive phenomenon that using textual unlearning to align MLLMs achieves comparable safety performances with MLLMs trained with image-text pairs. To explain such a counter-intuitive phenomenon, we discover a visual safety information leakage (VSIL) problem in existing multimodal safety benchmarks, i.e., the potentially risky and sensitive content in the image has been revealed in the textual query. In this way, MLLMs can easily refuse these sensitive text-image queries according to textual queries. However, image-text pairs without VSIL are common in real-world scenarios and are overlooked by existing multimodal safety benchmarks. To this end, we construct multimodal visual leakless safety benchmark (VLSBench) preventing visual safety leakage from image to textual query with 2.4k image-text pairs. Experimental results indicate that VLSBench poses a significant challenge to both open-source and close-source MLLMs, including LLaVA, Qwen2-VL, Llama3.2-Vision, and GPT-4o. This study demonstrates that textual alignment is enough for multimodal safety scenarios with VSIL, while multimodal alignment is a more promising solution for multimodal safety scenarios without VSIL.

|**2024-11-29**|**On Domain-Specific Post-Training for Multimodal Large Language Models**|Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of general multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, adapting general MLLMs to specific domains, such as scientific fields and industrial applications, remains less explored. This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs through post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipelines, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using open-source models, we develop a visual instruction synthesizer that effectively generates diverse visual instruction tasks from domain-specific image-caption pairs. Our synthetic tasks surpass those generated by manual rules, GPT-4, and GPT-4V in enhancing the domain-specific performance of MLLMs. (2) Training Pipeline: While the two-stage training--initially on image-caption pairs followed by visual instruction tasks--is commonly adopted for developing general MLLMs, we apply a single-stage training pipeline to enhance task diversity for domain-specific post-training. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct experiments in two domains, biomedicine and food, by post-training MLLMs of different sources and scales (e.g., Qwen2-VL-2B, LLaVA-v1.6-8B, Llama-3.2-11B), and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. To support further research in MLLM domain adaptation, we will open-source our implementations.|Daixuan Cheng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19930)|null|

Previous works have not effectively addressed the generation of long-term human scene interactions with detailed narratives for physics-based animation. This paper introduces a novel framework for the planning and controlling of long-horizon physical plausible human-scene interaction. On the one hand, films and shows with stylish human locomotions or interactions with scenes are abundantly available on the internet, providing a rich source of data for script planning. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) can understand and generate logical storylines.   This motivates us to marry the two by using an LLM-based pipeline to extract scripts from videos, and then employ LLMs to imitate and create new scripts, capturing complex, time-series human behaviors and interactions with environments. By leveraging this, we utilize a dual-aware policy that achieves both language comprehension and scene understanding to guide character motions within contextual and spatial constraints. To facilitate training and evaluation, we contribute a comprehensive planning dataset containing diverse motion sequences extracted from real-world videos and expand them with large language models. We also collect and re-annotate motion clips from existing kinematic datasets to enable our policy learn diverse skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and its generalization ability to various scenarios, showing remarkably enhanced performance compared with existing methods.

|**2024-11-29**|**PDDLFuse: A Tool for Generating Diverse Planning Domains**|Various real-world challenges require planning algorithms that can adapt to a broad range of domains. Traditionally, the creation of planning domains has relied heavily on human implementation, which limits the scale and diversity of available domains. While recent advancements have leveraged generative AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) for domain creation, these efforts have predominantly focused on translating existing domains from natural language descriptions rather than generating novel ones. In contrast, the concept of domain randomization, which has been highly effective in reinforcement learning, enhances performance and generalizability by training on a diverse array of randomized new domains. Inspired by this success, our tool, PDDLFuse, aims to bridge this gap in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). PDDLFuse is designed to generate new, diverse planning domains that can be used to validate new planners or test foundational planning models. We have developed methods to adjust the domain generators parameters to modulate the difficulty of the domains it generates. This adaptability is crucial as existing domain-independent planners often struggle with more complex problems. Initial tests indicate that PDDLFuse efficiently creates intricate and varied domains, representing a significant advancement over traditional domain generation methods and making a contribution towards planning research.|Vedant Khandelwal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19886)|null|
|**2024-12-02**|**LUMIA: Linear probing for Unimodal and MultiModal Membership Inference Attacks leveraging internal LLM states**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in a variety of applications, but concerns around membership inference have grown in parallel. Previous efforts focus on black-to-grey-box models, thus neglecting the potential benefit from internal LLM information. To address this, we propose the use of Linear Probes (LPs) as a method to detect Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) by examining internal activations of LLMs. Our approach, dubbed LUMIA, applies LPs layer-by-layer to get fine-grained data on the model inner workings. We test this method across several model architectures, sizes and datasets, including unimodal and multimodal tasks. In unimodal MIA, LUMIA achieves an average gain of 15.71 % in Area Under the Curve (AUC) over previous techniques. Remarkably, LUMIA reaches AUC>60% in 65.33% of cases -- an increment of 46.80% against the state of the art. Furthermore, our approach reveals key insights, such as the model layers where MIAs are most detectable. In multimodal models, LPs indicate that visual inputs can significantly contribute to detect MIAs -- AUC>60% is reached in 85.90% of experiments.|Luis Ibanez-Lissen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19876)|null|

AIDetx constructs distinct compression models for human-written and AI-generated text, classifying new inputs based on which model achieves a higher compression ratio. We evaluated AIDetx on two benchmark datasets, achieving F1 scores exceeding 97% and 99%, respectively, highlighting its high accuracy.

|**2024-11-29**|**Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners**|Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward thinking. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data augmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an average 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a 6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard fine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning. RevThink also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.|Justin Chih-Yao Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19865)|null|

In this work, we leverage the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and explore their performance in the CDR domain across multiple domain pairs. We introduce two novel prompt designs tailored for CDR and demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted effectively, outperform state-of-the-art CDR baselines across various metrics and domain combinations in the rating prediction and ranking tasks.

|**2024-11-27**|**Cross-modal Information Flow in Multimodal Large Language Models**|The recent advancements in auto-regressive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising progress for vision-language tasks. While there exists a variety of studies investigating the processing of linguistic information within large language models, little is currently known about the inner working mechanism of MLLMs and how linguistic and visual information interact within these models. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by examining the information flow between different modalities -- language and vision -- in MLLMs, focusing on visual question answering. Specifically, given an image-question pair as input, we investigate where in the model and how the visual and linguistic information are combined to generate the final prediction. Conducting experiments with a series of models from the LLaVA series, we find that there are two distinct stages in the process of integration of the two modalities. In the lower layers, the model first transfers the more general visual features of the whole image into the representations of (linguistic) question tokens. In the middle layers, it once again transfers visual information about specific objects relevant to the question to the respective token positions of the question. Finally, in the higher layers, the resulting multimodal representation is propagated to the last position of the input sequence for the final prediction. Overall, our findings provide a new and comprehensive perspective on the spatial and functional aspects of image and language processing in the MLLMs, thereby facilitating future research into multimodal information localization and editing.|Zhi Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18620)|null|

However, LLMs often struggle with spatial reasoning which is one essential part of reasoning and inference and requires understanding complex relationships between objects in space. This paper proposes a novel neural-symbolic framework that enhances LLMs' spatial reasoning abilities. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets: StepGame and SparQA, implementing three distinct strategies: (1) ASP (Answer Set Programming)-based symbolic reasoning, (2) LLM + ASP pipeline using DSPy, and (3) Fact + Logical rules. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline prompting methods, with accuracy increases of 40-50% on StepGame} dataset and 3-13% on the more complex SparQA dataset. The "LLM + ASP" pipeline achieves particularly strong results on the tasks of Finding Relations (FR) and Finding Block (FB) questions, though performance varies across different question types. The impressive results suggest that while neural-symbolic approaches offer promising directions for enhancing spatial reasoning in LLMs, their effectiveness depends heavily on the specific task characteristics and implementation strategies. We propose an integrated, simple yet effective set of strategies using a neural-symbolic pipeline to boost spatial reasoning abilities in LLMs. This pipeline and its strategies demonstrate strong and broader applicability to other reasoning domains in LLMs, such as temporal reasoning, deductive inference etc.|Rong Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18564)|null|

While recent diffusion-based planning approaches show promise for simpler manipulation tasks, they often produce unrealistic ghost states (e.g., the object automatically moves without hand contact) or lack adaptability when handling complex sequential interactions. In this work, we introduce DexDiffuser, an interaction-aware diffusion planning framework for adaptive dexterous manipulation. DexDiffuser models joint state-action dynamics through a dual-phase diffusion process which consists of pre-interaction contact alignment and post-contact goal-directed control, enabling goal-adaptive generalizable dexterous manipulation. Additionally, we incorporate dynamics model-based dual guidance and leverage large language models for automated guidance function generation, enhancing generalizability for physical interactions and facilitating diverse goal adaptation through language cues. Experiments on physical interaction tasks such as door opening, pen and block re-orientation, and hammer striking demonstrate DexDiffuser's effectiveness on goals outside training distributions, achieving over twice the average success rate (59.2% vs. 29.5%) compared to existing methods. Our framework achieves 70.0% success on 30-degree door opening, 40.0% and 36.7% on pen and block half-side re-orientation respectively, and 46.7% on hammer nail half drive, highlighting its robustness and flexibility in contact-rich manipulation.|Zhixuan Liang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18562)|null|
|**2024-11-27**|**Retrofitting (Large) Language Models with Dynamic Tokenization**|Current language models (LMs) use a fixed, static subword tokenizer. This choice, often taken for granted, typically results in degraded efficiency and capabilities in languages other than English, and makes it challenging to apply LMs to new domains or languages. To address these issues, we propose retrofitting LMs with dynamic tokenization: a way to dynamically decide on token boundaries based on the input text. For encoder-style models, we introduce a subword-merging algorithm inspired by byte-pair encoding (BPE), but at a batch level. We merge frequent subword sequences in a batch, then apply a pretrained embedding-prediction hypernetwork to compute the token embeddings on-the-fly. When applied with word-level boundaries, this on average reduces token sequence lengths by >20% across 14 languages on XNLI with XLM-R while degrading its task performance by less than 2%. For decoder-style models, we apply dynamic tokenization in two ways: 1) for prefilling, maintaining performance of Mistral-7B almost completely with up to 40% sequence reduction - relative to the word-level; and 2) via an approximate nearest neighbor index, achieving fast generation with a one million token vocabulary, demonstrating scalability to even larger, dynamic vocabularies. Overall, our findings show that dynamic tokenization substantially improves inference speed and promotes fairness across languages, making a leap towards overcoming the limitations of static tokenization and enabling more equitable and adaptable LMs.|Darius Feher et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18553)|null|

While existing approaches to artificial self-awareness often rely on heuristic implementations or philosophical abstractions, we present a formal framework grounded in metric space theory, measure theory, and functional analysis. Our framework posits that self-identity emerges from two mathematically quantifiable conditions: the existence of a connected continuum of memories $C \subseteq \mathcal{M}$ in a metric space $(\mathcal{M}, d_{\mathcal{M}})$, and a continuous mapping $I: \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{S}$ that maintains consistent self-recognition across this continuum, where $(\mathcal{S}, d_{\mathcal{S}})$ represents the metric space of possible self-identities. To validate this theoretical framework, we conducted empirical experiments using the Llama 3.2 1B model, employing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning. The model was trained on a synthetic dataset containing temporally structured memories, designed to capture the complexity of coherent self-identity formation. Our evaluation metrics included quantitative measures of self-awareness, response consistency, and linguistic precision. The experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in measurable self-awareness metrics, with the primary self-awareness score increasing from 0.276 to 0.801. This enables the structured creation of AI systems with validated self-identity features. The implications of our study are immediately relevant to the fields of humanoid robotics and autonomous systems.|Minhyeok Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18530)|**[link](https://github.com/BrainJellyPie/self)**|
|**2024-11-27**|**LLM-ABBA: Understand time series via symbolic approximation**|The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.   In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.|Erin Carson et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18506)|null|

However, generating interleaved image-text content remains a challenge, which requires integrated multimodal understanding and generation abilities. While the progress in unified models offers new solutions, existing benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating these methods due to data size and diversity limitations. To bridge this gap, we introduce GATE OpenING (OpenING), a comprehensive benchmark comprising 5,400 high-quality human-annotated instances across 56 real-world tasks. OpenING covers diverse daily scenarios such as travel guide, design, and brainstorming, offering a robust platform for challenging interleaved generation methods. In addition, we present IntJudge, a judge model for evaluating open-ended multimodal generation methods. Trained with a novel data pipeline, our IntJudge achieves an agreement rate of 82. 42% with human judgments, outperforming GPT-based evaluators by 11.34%. Extensive experiments on OpenING reveal that current interleaved generation methods still have substantial room for improvement. Key findings on interleaved image-text generation are further presented to guide the development of next-generation models.

|**2024-11-27**|**Beyond Examples: High-level Automated Reasoning Paradigm in In-Context Learning via MCTS**|In-context Learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to tackle downstream tasks through sophisticated prompting and high-quality demonstrations. However, this traditional ICL paradigm shows limitations when facing complex mathematical reasoning tasks, primarily due to its heavy dependence on example quality and the necessity for human intervention in challenging scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper presents HiAR-ICL, a \textbf{Hi}gh-level \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{R}easoning paradigm in \textbf{ICL} that shifts focus from specific examples to abstract thinking patterns, extending the conventional concept of context in ICL. HiAR-ICL introduces five atomic reasoning actions as fundamental components for constructing chain-structured patterns. Using Monte Carlo Tree Search, we explore reasoning paths and construct thought cards to guide subsequent inference. We then develop a cognitive complexity framework that dynamically matches problems with appropriate thought cards. Experimental results demonstrate HiAR-ICL's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy (79.6 $\%$) on the MATH benchmark with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, surpassing GPT-4o (76.6$\%$) and Claude 3.5 (71.1$\%$ ).|Jinyang Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18478)|null|
|**2024-11-26**|**Adaptive Deployment of Untrusted LLMs Reduces Distributed Threats**|As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable, it is prudent to assess whether safety measures remain effective even if LLMs intentionally try to bypass them. Previous work introduced control evaluations, an adversarial framework for testing deployment strategies of untrusted models (i.e., models which might be trying to bypass safety measures). While prior work treats a single failure as unacceptable, we perform control evaluations in a "distributed threat setting" -- a setting where no single action is catastrophic and no single action provides overwhelming evidence of misalignment. We approach this problem with a two-level deployment framework that uses an adaptive macro-protocol to choose between micro-protocols. Micro-protocols operate on a single task, using a less capable, but extensively tested (trusted) model to harness and monitor the untrusted model. Meanwhile, the macro-protocol maintains an adaptive credence on the untrusted model's alignment based on its past actions, using it to pick between safer and riskier micro-protocols. We evaluate our method in a code generation testbed where a red team attempts to generate subtly backdoored code with an LLM whose deployment is safeguarded by a blue team. We plot Pareto frontiers of safety (# of non-backdoored solutions) and usefulness (# of correct solutions). At a given level of usefulness, our adaptive deployment strategy reduces the number of backdoors by 80% compared to non-adaptive baselines.|Jiaxin Wen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17693)|null|
|**2024-11-27**|**Low-Bit Quantization Favors Undertrained LLMs: Scaling Laws for Quantized LLMs with 100T Training Tokens**|We reveal that low-bit quantization favors undertrained large language models (LLMs) by observing that models with larger sizes or fewer training tokens experience less quantization-induced degradation (QiD) when applying low-bit quantization, whereas smaller models with extensive training tokens suffer significant QiD. To gain deeper insights into this trend, we study over 1500 quantized LLM checkpoints of various sizes and at different training levels (undertrained or fully trained) in a controlled setting, deriving scaling laws for understanding the relationship between QiD and factors such as the number of training tokens, model size and bit width.   With the derived scaling laws, we propose a novel perspective that we can use QiD to measure an LLM's training levels and determine the number of training tokens required for fully training LLMs of various sizes. Moreover, we use the scaling laws to predict the quantization performance of different-sized LLMs trained with 100 trillion tokens. Our projection shows that the low-bit quantization performance of future models, which are expected to be trained with over 100 trillion tokens, may NOT be desirable. This poses a potential challenge for low-bit quantization in the future and highlights the need for awareness of a model's training level when evaluating low-bit quantization research. To facilitate future research on this problem, we release all the 1500+ quantized checkpoints used in this work at https://huggingface.co/Xu-Ouyang.|Xu Ouyang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17691)|null|
|**2024-11-26**|**Rethinking Token Reduction in MLLMs: Towards a Unified Paradigm for Training-Free Acceleration**|To accelerate the inference of heavy Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this study rethinks the current landscape of training-free token reduction research. We regret to find that the critical components of existing methods are tightly intertwined, with their interconnections and effects remaining unclear for comparison, transfer, and expansion. Therefore, we propose a unified ''filter-correlate-compress'' paradigm that decomposes the token reduction into three distinct stages within a pipeline, maintaining consistent design objectives and elements while allowing for unique implementations. We additionally demystify the popular works and subsume them into our paradigm to showcase its universality. Finally, we offer a suite of methods grounded in the paradigm, striking a balance between speed and accuracy throughout different phases of the inference. Experimental results across 10 benchmarks indicate that our methods can achieve up to an 82.4% reduction in FLOPs with a minimal impact on performance, simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art training-free methods.

|**2024-11-26**|**Enhancing Character-Level Understanding in LLMs through Token Internal Structure Learning**|Tokenization techniques such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and Byte-Level BPE (BBPE) have significantly improved the computational efficiency and vocabulary representation stability of large language models (LLMs) by segmenting text into tokens. However, this segmentation often obscures the internal character structures and sequences within tokens, preventing models from fully learning these intricate details during training. Consequently, LLMs struggle to comprehend the character compositions and positional relationships within tokens, especially when fine-tuned on downstream tasks with limited data. In this paper, we introduce Token Internal Position Awareness (TIPA), a novel approach that enhances LLMs' understanding of internal token structures by training them on reverse character prediction tasks using the tokenizer's own vocabulary. This method enables models to effectively learn and generalize character positions and internal structures. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs trained with TIPA outperform baseline models in predicting character positions at the token level. Furthermore, when applied to the downstream task of Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC), TIPA not only accelerates model convergence but also significantly improves task performance.|Zhu Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17679)|null|
|**2024-11-26**|**Push the Limit of Multi-modal Emotion Recognition by Prompting LLMs with Receptive-Field-Aware Attention Weighting**|Understanding the emotions in a dialogue usually requires external knowledge to accurately understand the contents. As the LLMs become more and more powerful, we do not want to settle on the limited ability of the pre-trained language model. However, the LLMs either can only process text modality or are too expensive to process the multimedia information. We aim to utilize both the power of LLMs and the supplementary features from the multimedia modalities. In this paper, we present a framework, Lantern, that can improve the performance of a certain vanilla model by prompting large language models with receptive-field-aware attention weighting. This framework trained a multi-task vanilla model to produce probabilities of emotion classes and dimension scores. These predictions are fed into the LLMs as references to adjust the predicted probabilities of each emotion class with its external knowledge and contextual understanding. We slice the dialogue into different receptive fields, and each sample is included in exactly t receptive fields. Finally, the predictions of LLMs are merged with a receptive-field-aware attention-driven weighting module. In the experiments, vanilla models CORECT and SDT are deployed in Lantern with GPT-4 or Llama-3.1-405B. The experiments in IEMOCAP with 4-way and 6-way settings demonstrated that the Lantern can significantly improve the performance of current vanilla models by up to 1.23% and 1.80%.|Liyun Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17674)|null|

While artificial systems have driven substantial advances in content creation and human-computer interaction, capturing the dynamic and abstract nature of human sketching remains challenging. In this work, we introduce SketchAgent, a language-driven, sequential sketch generation method that enables users to create, modify, and refine sketches through dynamic, conversational interactions. Our approach requires no training or fine-tuning. Instead, we leverage the sequential nature and rich prior knowledge of off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (LLMs). We present an intuitive sketching language, introduced to the model through in-context examples, enabling it to "draw" using string-based actions. These are processed into vector graphics and then rendered to create a sketch on a pixel canvas, which can be accessed again for further tasks. By drawing stroke by stroke, our agent captures the evolving, dynamic qualities intrinsic to sketching. We demonstrate that SketchAgent can generate sketches from diverse prompts, engage in dialogue-driven drawing, and collaborate meaningfully with human users.|Yael Vinker et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17673)|null|
|**2024-11-26**|**Synthetic Data Generation with LLM for Improved Depression Prediction**|Automatic detection of depression is a rapidly growing field of research at the intersection of psychology and machine learning. However, with its exponential interest comes a growing concern for data privacy and scarcity due to the sensitivity of such a topic. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data to improve the performance of depression prediction models. Starting from unstructured, naturalistic text data from recorded transcripts of clinical interviews, we utilize an open-source LLM to generate synthetic data through chain-of-thought prompting. This pipeline involves two key steps: the first step is the generation of the synopsis and sentiment analysis based on the original transcript and depression score, while the second is the generation of the synthetic synopsis/sentiment analysis based on the summaries generated in the first step and a new depression score. Not only was the synthetic data satisfactory in terms of fidelity and privacy-preserving metrics, it also balanced the distribution of severity in the training dataset, thereby significantly enhancing the model's capability in predicting the intensity of the patient's depression. By leveraging LLMs to generate synthetic data that can be augmented to limited and imbalanced real-world datasets, we demonstrate a novel approach to addressing data scarcity and privacy concerns commonly faced in automatic depression detection, all while maintaining the statistical integrity of the original dataset. This approach offers a robust framework for future mental health research and applications.|Andrea Kang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17672)|null|
|**2024-11-26**|**Toward High-Performance LLM Serving: A Simulation-Based Approach for Identifying Optimal Parallelism**|Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently has become crucial. LLMs are often served with multiple devices using techniques like data, pipeline, and tensor parallelisms. Each parallelism presents trade-offs between computation, memory, and communication overhead, making it challenging to determine the optimal parallel execution plan. Moreover, input workloads also impact parallelism strategies. Tasks with long prompts like article summarization are compute-intensive, while tasks with long generation lengths like code generation are often memory-intensive; these differing characteristics result in distinct optimal execution plans. Since searching for the optimal plan via actual deployment is prohibitively expensive, we propose APEX, an LLM serving system simulator that efficiently identifies an optimal parallel execution plan. APEX captures the complex characteristics of iteration-level batching, a technique widely used in SOTA LLM serving systems. APEX leverages the repetitive structure of LLMs to reduce design space, maintaining a similar simulation overhead, even when scaling to trillion scale models. APEX supports a wide range of LLMs, device clusters, etc., and it can be easily extended through its high-level templates. We run APEX simulations using a CPU and evaluate the identified optimal plans using 8 H100 GPUs, encompassing a wide range of LLMs and input workloads. We show that APEX can find optimal execution plans that are up to 4.42x faster than heuristic plans in terms of end-to-end serving latency. APEX also reports a set of metrics used in LLM serving systems, such as time per output token and time to first token. Furthermore, APEX can identify an optimal parallel execution plan within 15 minutes using a CPU. This is 71x faster and 1234x more cost-effective than actual deployment on a GPU cluster using cloud services. APEX will be open-sourced upon acceptance.|Yi-Chien Lin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17651)|null|
|**2024-11-26**|**On Limitations of LLM as Annotator for Low Resource Languages**|Low-resource languages face significant challenges due to the lack of sufficient linguistic data, resources, and tools for tasks such as supervised learning, annotation, and classification. This shortage hinders the development of accurate models and datasets, making it difficult to perform critical NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or hate speech detection. To bridge this gap, Large Language Models (LLMs) present an opportunity for potential annotators, capable of generating datasets and resources for these underrepresented languages. In this paper, we focus on Marathi, a low-resource language, and evaluate the performance of both closed-source and open-source LLMs as annotators. We assess models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.0 Pro, Gemma 2 (2B and 9B), and Llama 3.1 (8B) on classification tasks including sentiment analysis, news classification, and hate speech detection. Our findings reveal that while LLMs excel in annotation tasks for high-resource languages like English, they still fall short when applied to Marathi. Even advanced closed models like Gemini and GPT underperform in comparison to BERT-based baselines, highlighting the limitations of LLMs as annotators for low-resource languages.|Suramya Jadhav et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17637)|null|
|**2024-11-26**|**MALMM: Multi-Agent Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Robotics Manipulation**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable planning abilities across various domains, including robotics manipulation and navigation. While recent efforts in robotics have leveraged LLMs both for high-level and low-level planning, these approaches often face significant challenges, such as hallucinations in long-horizon tasks and limited adaptability due to the generation of plans in a single pass without real-time feedback. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-agent LLM framework, Multi-Agent Large Language Model for Manipulation (MALMM) that distributes high-level planning and low-level control code generation across specialized LLM agents, supervised by an additional agent that dynamically manages transitions. By incorporating observations from the environment after each step, our framework effectively handles intermediate failures and enables adaptive re-planning. Unlike existing methods, our approach does not rely on pre-trained skill policies or in-context learning examples and generalizes to a variety of new tasks. We evaluate our approach on nine RLBench tasks, including long-horizon tasks, and demonstrate its ability to solve robotics manipulation in a zero-shot setting, thereby overcoming key limitations of existing LLM-based manipulation methods.|Harsh Singh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17636)|null|
|**2024-11-25**|**Do Large Language Models Perform Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning without Exploiting Shortcuts?**|We evaluate how well Large Language Models (LLMs) latently recall and compose facts to answer multi-hop queries like "In the year Scarlett Johansson was born, the Summer Olympics were hosted in the country of". One major challenge in evaluating this ability is that LLMs may have developed shortcuts by encounters of the head entity "Scarlett Johansson" and the answer entity "United States" in the same training sequences or merely guess the answer based on frequency-based priors. To prevent shortcuts, we exclude test queries where the head and answer entities co-appear in pretraining corpora. Through careful selection of relations and facts and systematic removal of cases where models might guess answers or exploit partial matches, we construct an evaluation dataset SOCRATES (ShOrtCut-fRee lATent rEaSoning). We observe that LLMs demonstrate promising latent multi-hop reasoning abilities without exploiting shortcuts, but only for certain types of queries. For queries requiring latent recall of countries as the intermediate answer, the best models achieve 80% latent composability, but this drops to just 5% for the recall of years. Comparisons with Chain-of-Thought composability highlight a significant gap between the ability of models to reason latently versus explicitly. Analysis reveals that latent representations of the intermediate answer are constructed more often in queries with higher latent composability, and shows the emergence of latent multi-hop reasoning during pretraining.|Sohee Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16679)|null|

SVG holds great potential for diverse content creation in media and entertainment; however, it also presents significant challenges: (1) objects must exhibit a range of fine-grained, complex motions, (2) multiple objects need to appear consistently across scenes, and (3) subjects may require multiple motions with seamless transitions within a single scene. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRunner, a novel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input script using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained scene planning as well as fine-grained object-level layout and motion planning. Next, DreamRunner presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture target motion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motion customization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation of new videos with complex, scripted motions. Lastly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal region-based 3D attention and prior injection module SR3AI for fine-grained object-motion binding and frame-by-frame semantic control. We compare DreamRunner with various SVG baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in character consistency, text alignment, and smooth transitions. Additionally, DreamRunner exhibits strong fine-grained condition-following ability in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly outperforming baselines on T2V-ComBench. Finally, we validate DreamRunner's robust ability to generate multi-object interactions with qualitative examples.|Zun Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16657)|null|

However, current reward models mainly produce scalar scores and struggle to incorporate critiques in a natural language format. We hypothesize that predicting both critiques and the scalar reward would improve reward modeling ability. Motivated by this, we propose Critic-RM, a framework that improves reward models using self-generated critiques without extra supervision. Critic-RM employs a two-stage process: generating and filtering high-quality critiques, followed by joint fine-tuning on reward prediction and critique generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Critic-RM improves reward modeling accuracy by 3.7%-7.3% compared to standard reward models and LLM judges, demonstrating strong performance and data efficiency. Additional studies further validate the effectiveness of generated critiques in rectifying flawed reasoning steps with 2.5%-3.2% gains in improving reasoning accuracy.|Yue Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16646)|null|

To address these threats, we propose strategies involving advanced prompt analysis, dynamic safety protocols, and continuous model fine-tuning to strengthen AI resilience. Additionally, we highlight the need for collaboration among AI researchers, cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to set standards for protecting AI systems.

|**2024-11-25**|**Do Automatic Factuality Metrics Measure Factuality? A Critical Evaluation**|Modern LLMs can now produce highly readable abstractive summaries, to the point where traditional automated metrics for evaluating summary quality, such as ROUGE, have become saturated. However, LLMs still sometimes introduce unwanted content into summaries, i.e., information inconsistent with or unsupported by their source. Measuring the occurrence of these often subtle ``hallucinations'' automatically has proved to be challenging. This in turn has motivated development of a variety of metrics intended to measure the factual consistency of generated summaries against their source. But are these approaches measuring what they purport to do? In this work, we stress-test automatic factuality metrics. Specifically, we investigate whether and to what degree superficial attributes of summary texts suffice to predict ``factuality'', finding that a (supervised) model using only such shallow features is reasonably competitive with SOTA factuality scoring methods. We then evaluate how factuality metrics respond to factual corrections in inconsistent summaries and find that only a few show meaningful improvements. In contrast, some metrics are more sensitive to benign, non-factual edits. Motivated by these insights, we show that one can ``game'' (most) automatic factuality metrics, i.e., reliably inflate ``factuality'' scores by appending innocuous sentences to generated summaries.Taken together, our results raise questions about the degree to which we should rely on existing automated factuality metrics and what exactly we want ``factuality metrics'' to measure.|Sanjana Ramprasad et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16638)|null|

Despite their advantages, creating high-quality SVG content remains challenging, as it demands technical expertise with professional editing software and a considerable time investment to craft complex shapes. Recent text-to-SVG generation methods aim to make vector graphics creation more accessible, but they still encounter limitations in shape regularity, generalization ability, and expressiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce Chat2SVG, a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and image diffusion models for text-to-SVG generation. Our approach first uses an LLM to generate semantically meaningful SVG templates from basic geometric primitives. Guided by image diffusion models, a dual-stage optimization pipeline refines paths in latent space and adjusts point coordinates to enhance geometric complexity. Extensive experiments show that Chat2SVG outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity, path regularity, and semantic alignment. Additionally, our system enables intuitive editing through natural language instructions, making professional vector graphics creation accessible to all users.|Ronghuan Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16602)|null|

Recent advancements in explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have shown promise in enabling human-like decision-making. Notably, significant developments have occurred in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the decision-making of complex systems, such as self-driving cars. The textual and somewhat ambiguous nature of COLREGs (from an algorithmic perspective), however, poses challenges that align well with the capabilities of LLMs, suggesting that LLMs may become increasingly suitable for this application soon. This paper presents and demonstrates the first application of LLM-based decision-making and control for ASVs. The proposed method establishes a high-level decision-maker that uses online collision risk indices and key measurements to make decisions for safe manoeuvres. A tailored design and runtime structure is developed to support training and real-time action generation on a realistic ASV model. Local planning and control algorithms are integrated to execute the commands for waypoint following and collision avoidance at a lower level. To the authors' knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to apply explainable AI to the dynamic control problem of maritime systems recognising the COLREGs rules, opening new avenues for research in this challenging area. Results obtained across multiple test scenarios demonstrate the system's ability to maintain online COLREGs compliance, accurate waypoint tracking, and feasible control, while providing human-interpretable reasoning for each decision.|Klinsmann Agyei et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16587)|null|

|**2024-11-25**|**Enhancing LLM Reasoning via Critique Models with Test-Time and Training-Time Supervision**|Training large language models (LLMs) to spend more time thinking and reflection before responding is crucial for effectively solving complex reasoning tasks in fields such as science, coding, and mathematics. However, the effectiveness of mechanisms like self-reflection and self-correction depends on the model's capacity to accurately assess its own performance, which can be limited by factors such as initial accuracy, question difficulty, and the lack of external feedback. In this paper, we delve into a two-player paradigm that separates the roles of reasoning and critique models, where the critique model provides step-level feedback to supervise the reasoning (actor) model during both test-time and train-time. We first propose AutoMathCritique, an automated and scalable framework for collecting critique data, resulting in a dataset of $76,321$ responses paired with step-level feedback. Fine-tuning language models with this dataset enables them to generate natural language feedback for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate that the critique models consistently improve the actor's performance on difficult queries at test-time, especially when scaling up inference-time computation. Motivated by these findings, we introduce the critique-based supervision to the actor's self-training process, and propose a critique-in-the-loop self-improvement method. Experiments show that the method improves the actor's exploration efficiency and solution diversity, especially on challenging queries, leading to a stronger reasoning model. Lastly, we take the preliminary step to explore training self-talk reasoning models via critique supervision and showcase its potential.

|**2024-11-22**|**WildLMa: Long Horizon Loco-Manipulation in the Wild**|`In-the-wild' mobile manipulation aims to deploy robots in diverse real-world environments, which requires the robot to (1) have skills that generalize across object configurations; (2) be capable of long-horizon task execution in diverse environments; and (3) perform complex manipulation beyond pick-and-place. Quadruped robots with manipulators hold promise for extending the workspace and enabling robust locomotion, but existing results do not investigate such a capability. This paper proposes WildLMa with three components to address these issues: (1) adaptation of learned low-level controller for VR-enabled whole-body teleoperation and traversability; (2) WildLMa-Skill -- a library of generalizable visuomotor skills acquired via imitation learning or heuristics and (3) WildLMa-Planner -- an interface of learned skills that allow LLM planners to coordinate skills for long-horizon tasks. We demonstrate the importance of high-quality training data by achieving higher grasping success rate over existing RL baselines using only tens of demonstrations. WildLMa exploits CLIP for language-conditioned imitation learning that empirically generalizes to objects unseen in training demonstrations. Besides extensive quantitative evaluation, we qualitatively demonstrate practical robot applications, such as cleaning up trash in university hallways or outdoor terrains, operating articulated objects, and rearranging items on a bookshelf.|Ri-Zhao Qiu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15131)|null|

In this paper, we offer a rigorous investigation of this topic, identifying how the phenomenon has arisen, and how it might be analysed. In this paper, we elaborate on this argument to propose that LLM-based chatbots play the 'language game of bullshit'. We use statistical text analysis to investigate the features of this Wittgensteinian language game, based on a dataset constructed to contrast the language of 1,000 scientific publications with typical pseudo-scientific text generated by ChatGPT. We then explore whether the same language features can be detected in two well-known contexts of social dysfunction: George Orwell's critique of politics and language, and David Graeber's characterisation of bullshit jobs. Using simple hypothesis-testing methods, we demonstrate that a statistical model of the language of bullshit can reliably relate the Frankfurtian artificial bullshit of ChatGPT to the political and workplace functions of bullshit as observed in natural human language.|Alessandro Trevisan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15129)|null|
|**2024-11-22**|**AttriBoT: A Bag of Tricks for Efficiently Approximating Leave-One-Out Context Attribution**|The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.|Fengyuan Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15102)|**[link](https://github.com/r-three/AttriBoT)**|
|**2024-11-22**|**XGrammar: Flexible and Efficient Structured Generation Engine for Large Language Models**|The applications of LLM Agents are becoming increasingly complex and diverse, leading to a high demand for structured outputs that can be parsed into code, structured function calls, and embodied agent commands. These developments bring significant demands for structured generation in LLM inference. Context-free grammar is a flexible approach to enable structured generation via constrained decoding. However, executing context-free grammar requires going through several stack states over all tokens in vocabulary during runtime, bringing non-negligible overhead for structured generation. In this paper, we propose XGrammar, a flexible and efficient structure generation engine for large language models. XGrammar accelerates context-free grammar execution by dividing the vocabulary into context-independent tokens that can be prechecked and context-dependent tokens that need to be interpreted during runtime. We further build transformations to expand the grammar context and reduce the number of context-independent tokens. Additionally, we build an efficient persistent stack to accelerate the context-dependent token checks. Finally, we co-design the grammar engine with LLM inference engine to overlap grammar computation with GPU executions. Evaluation results show that XGrammar can achieve up to 100x speedup over existing solutions. Combined with an LLM inference engine, it can generate near-zero overhead structure generation in end-to-end low-LLM serving.|Yixin Dong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15100)|null|

Thus, multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) is naturally introduced to provide MLLMs with comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge, effectively expanding the knowledge scope. However, current mRAG methods have inherent drawbacks, including: 1) Performing retrieval even when external knowledge is not needed. 2) Lacking of identification of evidence that supports the query. 3) Increasing model complexity due to additional information filtering modules or rules. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel generalized framework called \textbf{m}ultimodal \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{R}eflection-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{G}eneration (mR$^2$AG), which achieves adaptive retrieval and useful information localization to enable answers through two easy-to-implement reflection operations, preventing high model complexity. In mR$^2$AG, Retrieval-Reflection is designed to distinguish different user queries and avoids redundant retrieval calls, and Relevance-Reflection is introduced to guide the MLLM in locating beneficial evidence of the retrieved content and generating answers accordingly. In addition, mR$^2$AG can be integrated into any well-trained MLLM with efficient fine-tuning on the proposed mR$^2$AG Instruction-Tuning dataset (mR$^2$AG-IT). mR$^2$ AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4v/o) and RAG-based MLLMs on INFOSEEK and Encyclopedic-VQA, while maintaining the exceptional capabilities of base MLLMs across a wide range of Visual-dependent tasks.|Tao Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15041)|null|
|**2024-11-22**|**One to rule them all: natural language to bind communication, perception and action**|In recent years, research in the area of human-robot interaction has focused on developing robots capable of understanding complex human instructions and performing tasks in dynamic and diverse environments. These systems have a wide range of applications, from personal assistance to industrial robotics, emphasizing the importance of robots interacting flexibly, naturally and safely with humans. This paper presents an advanced architecture for robotic action planning that integrates communication, perception, and planning with Large Language Models (LLMs). Our system is designed to translate commands expressed in natural language into executable robot actions, incorporating environmental information and dynamically updating plans based on real-time feedback. The Planner Module is the core of the system where LLMs embedded in a modified ReAct framework are employed to interpret and carry out user commands. By leveraging their extensive pre-trained knowledge, LLMs can effectively process user requests without the need to introduce new knowledge on the changing environment. The modified ReAct framework further enhances the execution space by providing real-time environmental perception and the outcomes of physical actions. By combining robust and dynamic semantic map representations as graphs with control components and failure explanations, this architecture enhances a robot adaptability, task execution, and seamless collaboration with human users in shared and dynamic environments. Through the integration of continuous feedback loops with the environment the system can dynamically adjusts the plan to accommodate unexpected changes, optimizing the robot ability to perform tasks. Using a dataset of previous experience is possible to provide detailed feedback about the failure.

|**2024-11-22**|**Time is on my sight: scene graph filtering for dynamic environment perception in an LLM-driven robot**|Robots are increasingly being used in dynamic environments like workplaces, hospitals, and homes. As a result, interactions with robots must be simple and intuitive, with robots perception adapting efficiently to human-induced changes. This paper presents a robot control architecture that addresses key challenges in human-robot interaction, with a particular focus on the dynamic creation and continuous update of the robot state representation. The architecture uses Large Language Models to integrate diverse information sources, including natural language commands, robotic skills representation, real-time dynamic semantic mapping of the perceived scene. This enables flexible and adaptive robotic behavior in complex, dynamic environments. Traditional robotic systems often rely on static, pre-programmed instructions and settings, limiting their adaptability to dynamic environments and real-time collaboration. In contrast, this architecture uses LLMs to interpret complex, high-level instructions and generate actionable plans that enhance human-robot collaboration. At its core, the system Perception Module generates and continuously updates a semantic scene graph using RGB-D sensor data, providing a detailed and structured representation of the environment. A particle filter is employed to ensure accurate object localization in dynamic, real-world settings. The Planner Module leverages this up-to-date semantic map to break down high-level tasks into sub-tasks and link them to robotic skills such as navigation, object manipulation (e.g., PICK and PLACE), and movement (e.g., GOTO). By combining real-time perception, state tracking, and LLM-driven communication and task planning, the architecture enhances adaptability, task efficiency, and human-robot collaboration in dynamic environments.|Simone Colombani et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15027)|null|
|**2024-11-22**|**DyCoke: Dynamic Compression of Tokens for Fast Video Large Language Models**|Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.|Keda Tao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15024)|null|

Most of these agents rely on general-purpose, proprietary models like GPT-4 and focus on designing better prompts to improve their planning abilities. However, general-purpose LLMs are not specifically trained to understand specialized web contexts such as HTML, and they often struggle with long-horizon planning. We explore an alternative approach that fine-tunes open-source LLMs using production-scale workflow data collected from over 250 domains corresponding to 6 billion tokens. This simple yet effective approach shows substantial gains over prompting-based agents on existing benchmarks -- ScribeAgent achieves state-of-the-art direct generation performance on Mind2Web and improves the task success rate by 14.1% over the previous best text-only web agents on WebArena. We further perform detailed ablation studies on various fine-tuning design choices and provide insights into LLM selection, training recipes, context window optimization, and effect of dataset sizes.|Junhong Shen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15004)|**[link](https://github.com/colonylabs/ScribeAgent)**|

Despite various efforts to improve LLM reasoning, high-quality long-chain reasoning data and optimized training pipelines still remain inadequately explored in vision-language tasks. In this paper, we present Insight-V, an early effort to 1) scalably produce long and robust reasoning data for complex multi-modal tasks, and 2) an effective training pipeline to enhance the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, to create long and structured reasoning data without human labor, we design a two-step pipeline with a progressive strategy to generate sufficiently long and diverse reasoning paths and a multi-granularity assessment method to ensure data quality. We observe that directly supervising MLLMs with such long and complex reasoning data will not yield ideal reasoning ability. To tackle this problem, we design a multi-agent system consisting of a reasoning agent dedicated to performing long-chain reasoning and a summary agent trained to judge and summarize reasoning results. We further incorporate an iterative DPO algorithm to enhance the reasoning agent's generation stability and quality. Based on the popular LLaVA-NeXT model and our stronger base MLLM, we demonstrate significant performance gains across challenging multi-modal benchmarks requiring visual reasoning. Benefiting from our multi-agent system, Insight-V can also easily maintain or improve performance on perception-focused multi-modal tasks.|Yuhao Dong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14432)|**[link](https://github.com/dongyh20/insight-v)**|

However, achieving high fidelity in zero-shot video tasks remains challenging. Traditional video processing methods rely heavily on fine-tuning to capture nuanced spatial-temporal details, which incurs significant data and computation costs. In contrast, training-free approaches, though efficient, often lack robustness in preserving context-rich features across complex video content. To this end, we propose DYTO, a novel dynamic token merging framework for zero-shot video understanding that adaptively optimizes token efficiency while preserving crucial scene details. DYTO integrates a hierarchical frame selection and a bipartite token merging strategy to dynamically cluster key frames and selectively compress token sequences, striking a balance between computational efficiency with semantic richness. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DYTO, achieving superior performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods and setting a new state-of-the-art for zero-shot video understanding.|Yiming Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14401)|null|

As a result, there is a growing need to implement robust guardrails that monitor, quantize and control an LLM's behavior, ensuring that the use is reliable, safe, accurate and also aligned with the users' expectations. Previous approaches for filtering out inappropriate user prompts or system outputs, such as LlamaGuard and OpenAI's MOD API, have achieved significant success by fine-tuning existing LLMs. However, using fine-tuned LLMs as guardrails introduces increased latency and higher maintenance costs, which may not be practical or scalable for cost-efficient deployments. We take a different approach, focusing on fine-tuning a lightweight architecture: Sentence-BERT. This method reduces the model size from LlamaGuard's 7 billion parameters to approximately 67 million, while maintaining comparable performance on the AEGIS safety benchmark.|Aaron Zheng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14398)|null|

We demonstrate that leveraging this data to fine-tuning multilingual LLMs via efficient adapter methods (QLoRA) significantly boosts performance on the low-resource language, while minimizing VRAM usage. Our experiments show large improvements in language modeling perplexity and an increase in few-shot prompting scores.

In general, previous efforts resort to sampling training data from different domains with static proportions, as well as adjusting data proportions during training. However, few methods have addressed the complexities of domain-adaptive continual pre-training. To fill this gap, we propose Velocitune, a novel framework dynamically assesses learning velocity and adjusts data proportions accordingly, favoring slower-learning domains while shunning faster-learning ones, which is guided by a scaling law to indicate the desired learning goal for each domain with less associated cost. To evaluate the effectiveness of Velocitune, we conduct experiments in a reasoning-focused dataset with CodeLlama, as well as in a corpus specialised for system command generation with Llama3 and Mistral. Velocitune achieves performance gains in both math and code reasoning tasks and command-line generation benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that key factors driving Velocitune's effectiveness include target loss prediction and data ordering.|Zheheng Luo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14318)|null|

In the era of code-generating large language models (LLMs), the ability for students to reason about code and identify errors is increasingly important. However, students frequently resort to trial-and-error methods to resolve bugs without fully understanding the underlying issues. Developing the ability to identify and hypothesize the cause of bugs is crucial but can be time-consuming to teach effectively through traditional means. This paper introduces BugSpotter, an innovative tool that leverages an LLM to generate buggy code from a problem description and verify the synthesized bugs via a test suite. Students interact with BugSpotter by designing failing test cases, where the buggy code's output differs from the expected result as defined by the problem specification. This not only provides opportunities for students to enhance their debugging skills, but also to practice reading and understanding problem specifications. We deployed BugSpotter in a large classroom setting and compared the debugging exercises it generated to exercises hand-crafted by an instructor for the same problems. We found that the LLM-generated exercises produced by BugSpotter varied in difficulty and were well-matched to the problem specifications. Importantly, the LLM-generated exercises were comparable to those manually created by instructors with respect to student performance, suggesting that BugSpotter could be an effective and efficient aid for learning debugging.|Victor-Alexandru Pădurean et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14303)|null|

It addresses a long-standing challenge in automating netlist generation for analog circuits within circuit design automation. Automating this workflow could accelerate the creation of finetuned LLMs for analog circuit design and verification. We identify key challenges in this automation and evaluate the multi-modal capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, particularly GPT-4, to address these issues. We propose a three-step workflow to overcome current limitations: labeling analog circuits, prompt tuning, and netlist verification. This approach aims to create an end-to-end SPICE netlist generator from circuit schematic images, tackling the long-standing hurdle of accurate netlist generation.

|**2024-11-21**|**CAIP: Detecting Router Misconfigurations with Context-Aware Iterative Prompting of LLMs**|Model checkers and consistency checkers detect critical errors in router configurations, but these tools require significant manual effort to develop and maintain. LLM-based Q&A models have emerged as a promising alternative, allowing users to query partitions of configurations through prompts and receive answers based on learned patterns, thanks to transformer models pre-trained on vast datasets that provide generic configuration context for interpreting router configurations. Yet, current methods of partition-based prompting often do not provide enough network-specific context from the actual configurations to enable accurate inference. We introduce a Context-Aware Iterative Prompting (CAIP) framework that automates network-specific context extraction and optimizes LLM prompts for more precise router misconfiguration detection. CAIP addresses three challenges: (1) efficiently mining relevant context from complex configuration files, (2) accurately distinguishing between pre-defined and user-defined parameter values to prevent irrelevant context from being introduced, and (3) managing prompt context overload with iterative, guided interactions with the model. Our evaluations on synthetic and real-world configurations show that CAIP improves misconfiguration detection accuracy by more than 30% compared to partition-based LLM approaches, model checkers, and consistency checkers, uncovering over 20 previously undetected misconfigurations in real-world configurations.|Xi Jiang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14283)|null|
|**2024-11-21**|**Looking Beyond Text: Reducing Language bias in Large Vision-Language Models via Multimodal Dual-Attention and Soft-Image Guidance**|Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results in various vision-language tasks. However, despite showing promising performance, LVLMs suffer from hallucinations caused by language bias, leading to diminished focus on images and ineffective visual comprehension. We identify two primary reasons for this bias: 1. Different scales of training data between the pretraining stage of LLM and multimodal alignment stage. 2. The learned inference bias due to short-term dependency of text data. Therefore, we propose LACING, a systemic framework designed to address the language bias of LVLMs with muLtimodal duAl-attention meChanIsm (MDA) aNd soft-image Guidance (IFG). Specifically, MDA introduces a parallel dual-attention mechanism that enhances the integration of visual inputs across the model. IFG introduces a learnable soft visual prompt during training and inference to replace visual inputs, designed to compel LVLMs to prioritize text inputs. Then, IFG further proposes a novel decoding strategy using the soft visual prompt to mitigate the model's over-reliance on adjacent text inputs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively debiases LVLMs from their language bias, enhancing visual comprehension and reducing hallucinations without requiring additional training resources or data.

In this work, we release a new dataset for ABS of Climate Change reports and we employ different Large Language Models (LLMs) and so-called Small Language Models (SLMs) to tackle this problem in an unsupervised way. Considering the problem at hand, we also show how SLMs are not significantly worse for the problem while leading to reduced carbon footprint; we do so by applying for the first time an existing framework considering both energy efficiency and task performance to the evaluation of zero-shot generative models for ABS. Overall, our results show that modern language models, both big and small, can effectively tackle ABS for Climate Change reports but more research is needed when we frame the problem as a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) problem and our work and dataset will help foster efforts in this direction.|Iacopo Ghinassi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14272)|**[link](https://github.com/ighina/llmclimate2024)**|

While there are several benchmark environments for evaluating LLMs on this task, they typically only give a success rate without any explanation of the failure cases. To solve this problem, we introduce SpecTool, a new benchmark to identify error patterns in LLM output on tool-use tasks. Our benchmark data set comprises of queries from diverse environments that can be used to test for the presence of seven newly characterized error patterns.

Real-world tasks require handling intricate interactions, advanced spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous exploration of new strategies-areas in which we lack effective methodologies for comprehensively evaluating these capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce BALROG, a novel benchmark designed to assess the agentic capabilities of LLMs and VLMs through a diverse set of challenging games. Our benchmark incorporates a range of existing reinforcement learning environments with varying levels of difficulty, including tasks that are solvable by non-expert humans in seconds to extremely challenging ones that may take years to master (e.g., the NetHack Learning Environment). We devise fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct an extensive evaluation of several popular open-source and closed-source LLMs and VLMs. Our findings indicate that while current models achieve partial success in the easier games, they struggle significantly with more challenging tasks. Notably, we observe severe deficiencies in vision-based decision-making, as models perform worse when visual representations of the environments are provided.

|**2024-11-20**|**Metacognition for Unknown Situations and Environments (MUSE)**|Metacognition--the awareness and regulation of one's cognitive processes--is central to human adaptability in unknown situations. In contrast, current autonomous agents often struggle in novel environments due to their limited capacity for adaptation. We hypothesize that metacognition is a critical missing ingredient in adaptive autonomous systems, equipping them with the cognitive flexibility needed to tackle unfamiliar challenges. Given the broad scope of metacognitive abilities, we focus on two key aspects: competence awareness and strategy selection for novel tasks. To this end, we propose the Metacognition for Unknown Situations and Environments (MUSE) framework, which integrates metacognitive processes--specifically self-awareness and self-regulation--into autonomous agents. We present two initial implementations of MUSE: one based on world modeling and another leveraging large language models (LLMs), both instantiating the metacognitive cycle. Our system continuously learns to assess its competence on a given task and uses this self-awareness to guide iterative cycles of strategy selection. MUSE agents show significant improvements in self-awareness and self-regulation, enabling them to solve novel, out-of-distribution tasks more effectively compared to Dreamer-v3-based reinforcement learning and purely prompt-based LLM agent approaches. This work highlights the promise of approaches inspired by cognitive and neural systems in enabling autonomous systems to adapt to new environments, overcoming the limitations of current methods that rely heavily on extensive training data.|Rodolfo Valiente et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13537)|null|

Arabic, with its complex morphology, syntax, and diglossia, poses unique challenges for natural language processing (NLP) in medical contexts.

However, the existing LLM inference pipeline operates as an opaque process without explicit separation between knowledge retrieval and reasoning steps, making the model's decision-making process unclear and disorganized. This ambiguity can lead to issues such as hallucinations and knowledge forgetting, which significantly impact the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we propose a new inference paradigm that decomposes the complex inference process into two distinct and clear actions: (1) memory recall: which retrieves relevant knowledge, and (2) reasoning: which performs logical steps based on the recalled knowledge. To facilitate this decomposition, we introduce two special tokens memory and reason, guiding the model to distinguish between steps that require knowledge retrieval and those that involve reasoning. Our experiment results show that this decomposition not only improves model performance but also enhances the interpretability of the inference process, enabling users to identify sources of error and refine model responses effectively.

Utilizing gpt-4o-mini, a cost-effective alternative to larger commercial LLMs, three methods, Word+Review, Review+Word, and Supply-Word, were each used to synthesize 1000 product reviews. The generated datasets were assessed for sentiment alignment, textual diversity, and data generation cost. Results demonstrated high sentiment alignment across all methods, with Pearson correlations ranging from 0.93 to 0.97. Supply-Word exhibited the highest diversity and coverage of PDT terms, although with increased generation costs. Despite minor biases toward positive sentiments, in situations with limited test data, LLM-generated synthetic data offers significant advantages, including scalability, cost savings, and flexibility in dataset production.|John D.

If it is not, a US patent examiner will cite the prior work, or prior art, that invalidates the novelty and issue a non-final rejection. Predicting what claims of the invention should change given the prior art is an essential and crucial step in securing invention rights, yet has not been studied before as a learnable task. In this work we introduce the PatentEdits dataset, which contains 105K examples of successful revisions that overcome objections to novelty. We design algorithms to label edits sentence by sentence, then establish how well these edits can be predicted with large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that evaluating textual entailment between cited references and draft sentences is especially effective in predicting which inventive claims remained unchanged or are novel in relation to prior art.|Ryan Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13477)|null|
|**2024-11-20**|**When Precision Meets Position: BFloat16 Breaks Down RoPE in Long-Context Training**|Extending context window sizes allows large language models (LLMs) to process longer sequences and handle more complex tasks. Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) has become the de facto standard due to its relative positional encoding properties that benefit long-context training. However, we observe that using RoPE with BFloat16 format results in numerical issues, causing it to deviate from its intended relative positional encoding, especially in long-context scenarios. This issue arises from BFloat16's limited precision and accumulates as context length increases, with the first token contributing significantly to this problem. To address this, we develop AnchorAttention, a plug-and-play attention method that alleviates numerical issues caused by BFloat16, improves long-context capabilities, and speeds up training. AnchorAttention reduces unnecessary attention computations, maintains semantic coherence, and boosts computational efficiency by treating the first token as a shared anchor with a consistent position ID, making it visible to all documents within the training context. Experiments on three types of LLMs demonstrate that AnchorAttention significantly improves long-context performance and reduces training time by over 50\% compared to standard full attention mechanisms, while preserving the original LLM's capabilities on general tasks.

|**2024-11-20**|**SoK: A Systems Perspective on Compound AI Threats and Countermeasures**|Large language models (LLMs) used across enterprises often use proprietary models and operate on sensitive inputs and data. The wide range of attack vectors identified in prior research - targeting various software and hardware components used in training and inference - makes it extremely challenging to enforce confidentiality and integrity policies.   As we advance towards constructing compound AI inference pipelines that integrate multiple large language models (LLMs), the attack surfaces expand significantly. Attackers now focus on the AI algorithms as well as the software and hardware components associated with these systems. While current research often examines these elements in isolation, we find that combining cross-layer attack observations can enable powerful end-to-end attacks with minimal assumptions about the threat model. Given, the sheer number of existing attacks at each layer, we need a holistic and systemized understanding of different attack vectors at each layer.   This SoK discusses different software and hardware attacks applicable to compound AI systems and demonstrates how combining multiple attack mechanisms can reduce the threat model assumptions required for an isolated attack. Next, we systematize the ML attacks in lines with the Mitre Att&ck framework to better position each attack based on the threat model. Finally, we outline the existing countermeasures for both software and hardware layers and discuss the necessity of a comprehensive defense strategy to enable the secure and high-performance deployment of compound AI systems.|Sarbartha Banerjee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13459)|null|

Current strategies for building web agents rely on (i) the generalizability of underlying MLLMs and their steerability via prompting, and (ii) large-scale fine-tuning of MLLMs on web-related tasks. However, web agents still struggle to automate tasks on unseen websites and domains, limiting their applicability to enterprise-specific and proprietary platforms. Beyond generalization from large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning, we propose building agents for few-shot adaptability using human demonstrations. We introduce the AdaptAgent framework that enables both proprietary and open-weights multimodal web agents to adapt to new websites and domains using few human demonstrations (up to 2). Our experiments on two popular benchmarks -- Mind2Web & VisualWebArena -- show that using in-context demonstrations (for proprietary models) or meta-adaptation demonstrations (for meta-learned open-weights models) boosts task success rate by 3.36% to 7.21% over non-adapted state-of-the-art models, corresponding to a relative increase of 21.03% to 65.75%. Furthermore, our additional analyses (a) show the effectiveness of multimodal demonstrations over text-only ones, (b) shed light on the influence of different data selection strategies during meta-learning on the generalization of the agent, and (c) demonstrate the effect of number of few-shot examples on the web agent's success rate. Overall, our results unlock a complementary axis for developing widely applicable multimodal web agents beyond large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning, emphasizing few-shot adaptability.|Gaurav Verma et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13451)|null|

This highlights the need for automated instruction optimization; however, this optimization is particularly challenging when dealing with black-box LLMs, where model parameters and gradients remain inaccessible. We propose ACING, a task-specific prompt optimization approach framed as a stateless continuous-action Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem, known as the continuum bandit setting. ACING leverages an actor-critic-based method to optimize prompts, learning from non-differentiable reward signals. We validate ACING by optimizing prompts for ChatGPT on 30 instruction-based tasks. ACING consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving a median score improvement of 10 percentage points. Furthermore, ACING not only recovers but also surpasses human-crafted expert instructions, achieving up to a 39 percentage point improvement against human benchmarks.|Salma Kharrat et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12736)|**[link](https://github.com/salmakh1/ACING)**|

However, considered as a means of communication, language differs considerably from its printed form: (i) the units of information are not characters or even words but clauses, i.e. shortest meaningful parts of speech; and (ii) what is transmitted is principally the meaning of what is being said or written, while the precise phrasing that was used to communicate the meaning is typically ignored. In this study, we show that one can leverage recently developed large language models to quantify information communicated in meaningful narratives in terms of bits of meaning per clause.|Doron Sivan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12728)|null|

We excluded non-cancer conditions and examined four specific diseases. We assessed four LLMs, BioBERT, XLNet, and BERT, as well as a novel base model (Last-BERT). BioBERT, which was pre-trained on medical data, demonstrated superior performance in medical text classification (97% accuracy). Surprisingly, XLNet followed closely (96% accuracy), demonstrating its generalizability across domains even though it was not pre-trained on medical data. LastBERT, a custom model based on the lighter version of BERT, also proved competitive with 87.10% accuracy (just under BERT's 89.33%). Our findings confirm the importance of specialized models such as BioBERT and also support impressions around more general solutions like XLNet and well-tuned transformer architectures with fewer parameters (in this case, LastBERT) in medical domain tasks.|Ahmed Akib Jawad Karim et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12712)|null|

Defying BERT?**|The rapid spread of misinformation, particularly through online platforms, underscores the urgent need for reliable detection systems. This study explores the utilization of machine learning and natural language processing, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and BERT, to detect news that are fake. We employ three distinct text vectorization methods for SVM: Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec, and Bag of Words (BoW) evaluating their effectiveness in distinguishing between genuine and fake news. Additionally, we compare these methods against the transformer large language model, BERT. Our comprehensive approach includes detailed preprocessing steps, rigorous model implementation, and thorough evaluation to determine the most effective techniques. The results demonstrate that while BERT achieves superior accuracy with 99.98% and an F1-score of 0.9998, the SVM model with a linear kernel and BoW vectorization also performs exceptionally well, achieving 99.81% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9980. These findings highlight that, despite BERT's superior performance, SVM models with BoW and TF-IDF vectorization methods come remarkably close, offering highly competitive performance with the advantage of lower computational requirements.|Ahmed Akib Jawad Karim et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12703)|null|
|**2024-11-19**|**When Backdoors Speak: Understanding LLM Backdoor Attacks Through Model-Generated Explanations**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where hidden triggers can maliciously manipulate model behavior. While several backdoor attack methods have been proposed, the mechanisms by which backdoor functions operate in LLMs remain underexplored. In this paper, we move beyond attacking LLMs and investigate backdoor functionality through the novel lens of natural language explanations. Specifically, we leverage LLMs' generative capabilities to produce human-understandable explanations for their decisions, allowing us to compare explanations for clean and poisoned samples. We explore various backdoor attacks and embed the backdoor into LLaMA models for multiple tasks. Our experiments show that backdoored models produce higher-quality explanations for clean data compared to poisoned data, while generating significantly more consistent explanations for poisoned data than for clean data. We further analyze the explanation generation process, revealing that at the token level, the explanation token of poisoned samples only appears in the final few transformer layers of the LLM. At the sentence level, attention dynamics indicate that poisoned inputs shift attention from the input context when generating the explanation. These findings deepen our understanding of backdoor attack mechanisms in LLMs and offer a framework for detecting such vulnerabilities through explainability techniques, contributing to the development of more secure LLMs.|Huaizhi Ge et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12701)|null|

Recent research has proposed replacing SiLU with ReLU to induce significant activation sparsity and showed no downstream task accuracy degradation through fine tuning. However, taking full advantage of it required training a predictor to estimate this sparsity. In this paper, we introduce SparseInfer, a simple, light weight, and training free predictor for activation sparsity of ReLU field LLMs, in which activation sparsity is predicted by comparing only the sign bits of inputs and weights. To compensate for possible prediction inaccuracy, an adaptive tuning of the predictor's conservativeness is enabled, which can also serve as a control knob for optimizing LLM inference. The proposed method achieves approximately faster inference speed over the state of the art, with negligible accuracy loss of within 1%p.|Jiho Shin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12692)|null|

The research enabled us to create a novel framework that we have developed for Learner Systems. Leveraging art of Large models to create key features including: - Real-time translation between these two sign languages in an efficient manner. Making LLM's capability available for seamless translations to ISL. Here is the full study showing its implementation in this paper. The core of the system is a sophisticated pipeline that begins with reclassification and recognition of ASL gestures based on a strong Random Forest Classifier. By recognizing the ASL, it is translated into text which can be more easily processed. Highly evolved natural language NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques come in handy as they play a role in our LLM integration where you then use LLMs to be able to convert the ASL text to ISL which provides you with the intent of sentence or phrase. The final step is to synthesize the translated text back into ISL gestures, creating an end-to-end translation experience using RIFE-Net. This framework is tasked with key challenges such as automatically dealing with gesture variability and overcoming the linguistic differences between ASL and ISL. By automating the translation process, we hope to vastly improve accessibility for sign language users. No longer will the communication gap between ASL and ISL create barriers; this totally cool innovation aims to bring our communities closer together. And we believe, with full confidence in our framework, that we're able to apply the same principles across a wide variety of sign language dialects.|Malay Kumar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12685)|null|

In this work we present a novel approach to enhance and exploit LLM reactive capability to address complex problems and interpret deeply contextual real-world meaning. We introduce a method and a tool for creating a multimodal, knowledge-augmented formal representation of meaning that combines the strengths of large language models with structured semantic representations. Our method begins with an image input, utilizing state-of-the-art large language models to generate a natural language description. This description is then transformed into an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph, which is formalized and enriched with logical design patterns, and layered semantics derived from linguistic and factual knowledge bases. The resulting graph is then fed back into the LLM to be extended with implicit knowledge activated by complex heuristic learning, including semantic implicatures, moral values, embodied cognition, and metaphorical representations. By bridging the gap between unstructured language models and formal semantic structures, our method opens new avenues for tackling intricate problems in natural language understanding and reasoning.|Stefano De Giorgis et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12671)|null|

Most text retrieval systems are tailored for natural language queries, often neglecting the specific challenges of retrieving code. This gap leaves existing models unable to effectively capture the diversity of programming languages and tasks across different domains, highlighting the need for more focused research in code retrieval. To address this, we introduce CodeXEmbed, a family of large-scale code embedding models ranging from 400M to 7B parameters. Our novel training pipeline unifies multiple programming languages and transforms various code-related tasks into a common retrieval framework, enhancing model generalizability and retrieval performance. Our 7B model sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in code retrieval, outperforming the previous leading model, Voyage-Code, by over 20% on CoIR benchmark. In addition to excelling in code retrieval, our models demonstrate competitive performance on the widely adopted BeIR text retrieval benchmark, offering versatility across domains.

However, most existing LLM-based models (e.g., VideoLLaMA, VideoChat) are constrained to processing short-duration videos. Recent attempts to understand long-term videos by extracting and compressing visual features into a fixed memory size. Nevertheless, those methods leverage only visual modality to merge video tokens and overlook the correlation between visual and textual queries, leading to difficulties in effectively handling complex question-answering tasks. To address the challenges of long videos and complex prompts, we propose AdaCM$^2$, which, for the first time, introduces an adaptive cross-modality memory reduction approach to video-text alignment in an auto-regressive manner on video streams. Our extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as video captioning, video question answering, and video classification, demonstrate that AdaCM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets while significantly reducing memory usage.

|**2024-11-18**|**Generative World Explorer**|Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state.In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.|Taiming Lu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844)|null|

|**2024-11-18**|**BitMoD: Bit-serial Mixture-of-Datatype LLM Acceleration**|Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various machine learning tasks. Yet the substantial memory footprint of LLMs significantly hinders their deployment. In this paper, we improve the accessibility of LLMs through BitMoD, an algorithm-hardware co-design solution that enables efficient LLM acceleration at low weight precision. On the algorithm side, BitMoD introduces fine-grained data type adaptation that uses a different numerical data type to quantize a group of (e.g., 128) weights. Through the careful design of these new data types, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to very low precision (e.g., 4 bits and 3 bits) while maintaining high accuracy. On the hardware side, BitMoD employs a bit-serial processing element to easily support multiple numerical precisions and data types; our hardware design includes two key innovations: First, it employs a unified representation to process different weight data types, thus reducing the hardware cost. Second, it adopts a bit-serial dequantization unit to rescale the per-group partial sum with minimal hardware overhead. Our evaluation on six representative LLMs demonstrates that BitMoD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM quantization and acceleration methods. For discriminative tasks, BitMoD can quantize LLM weights to 4-bit with $<\!0.5\%$ accuracy loss on average. For generative tasks, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to 3-bit while achieving better perplexity than prior LLM quantization scheme. Combining the superior model performance with an efficient accelerator design, BitMoD achieves an average of $1.69\times$ and $1.48\times$ speedups compared to prior LLM accelerators ANT and OliVe, respectively.|Yuzong Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11745)|null|

Our study is based on two experiments designed to assess the susceptibility of LLMs to moral persuasion. In the first experiment, we examine the susceptibility to moral ambiguity by evaluating a Base Agent LLM on morally ambiguous scenarios and observing how a Persuader Agent attempts to modify the Base Agent's initial decisions. The second experiment evaluates the susceptibility of LLMs to align with predefined ethical frameworks by prompting them to adopt specific value alignments rooted in established philosophical theories. The results demonstrate that LLMs can indeed be persuaded in morally charged scenarios, with the success of persuasion depending on factors such as the model used, the complexity of the scenario, and the conversation length. Notably, LLMs of distinct sizes but from the same company produced markedly different outcomes, highlighting the variability in their susceptibility to ethical persuasion.|Allison Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11731)|null|

To address this challenge, we propose a skill library framework based on knowledge graphs, which endows robots with high-level skill awareness and spatial semantic understanding. The framework hierarchically organizes operational knowledge by constructing a "task graph" and a "scene graph" to represent task and scene semantic information, respectively. We introduce a "state graph" to facilitate interaction between high-level task planning and low-level scene information. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical transfer framework for operational skills. At the task level, the framework integrates contextual learning and chain-of-thought prompting within a four-stage prompt paradigm, leveraging large language models' (LLMs) reasoning and generalization capabilities to achieve task-level subtask sequence transfer. At the motion level, an adaptive trajectory transfer method is developed using the A* algorithm and the skill library, enabling motion-level adaptive trajectory transfer. At the physical level, we introduce an adaptive contour extraction and posture perception method based on tactile perception. This method dynamically obtains high-precision contour and posture information from visual-tactile texture data and adjusts transferred skills, such as contact positions and postures, to ensure effectiveness in new environments. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

To address these limitations, we propose VeriGraph, a novel framework that integrates VLMs for robotic planning while verifying action feasibility. VeriGraph employs scene graphs as an intermediate representation, capturing key objects and spatial relationships to improve plan verification and refinement. The system generates a scene graph from input images and uses it to iteratively check and correct action sequences generated by an LLM-based task planner, ensuring constraints are respected and actions are executable. Our approach significantly enhances task completion rates across diverse manipulation scenarios, outperforming baseline methods by 58% for language-based tasks and 30% for image-based tasks.|Daniel Ekpo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10446)|null|
|**2024-11-15**|**Enhancing the Reasoning Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models via Mixed Preference Optimization**|Existing open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generally follow a training process involving pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. However, these models suffer from distribution shifts, which limit their multimodal reasoning, particularly in the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) performance. To address this, we introduce a preference optimization (PO) process to enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Specifically, (1) on the data side, we design an automated preference data construction pipeline to create MMPR, a high-quality, large-scale multimodal reasoning preference dataset. and (2) on the model side, we explore integrating PO with MLLMs, developing a simple yet effective method, termed Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO), which boosts multimodal CoT performance. Our approach demonstrates improved performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly in multimodal reasoning tasks. Notably, our model, InternVL2-8B-MPO, achieves an accuracy of 67.0 on MathVista, outperforming InternVL2-8B by 8.7 points and achieving performance comparable to the 10x larger InternVL2-76B. We hope this study could inspire further advancements in MLLMs. Code, data, and model shall be publicly released.|Weiyun Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10442)|null|

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-o1, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-o1 independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-o1 to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-o1-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-o1 not only outperforms its base model by 8.9% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.|Guowei Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10440)|null|
|**2024-11-15**|**MARS: Unleashing the Power of Variance Reduction for Training Large Models**|Training deep neural networks--and more recently, large models--demands efficient and scalable optimizers. Adaptive gradient algorithms like Adam, AdamW, and their variants have been central to this task. Despite the development of numerous variance reduction algorithms in the past decade aimed at accelerating stochastic optimization in both convex and nonconvex settings, variance reduction has not found widespread success in training deep neural networks or large language models. Consequently, it has remained a less favored approach in modern AI. In this paper, to unleash the power of variance reduction for efficient training of large models, we propose a unified optimization framework, MARS (Make vAriance Reduction Shine), which reconciles preconditioned gradient methods with variance reduction via a scaled stochastic recursive momentum technique. Within our framework, we introduce three instances of MARS that leverage preconditioned gradient updates based on AdamW, Lion, and Shampoo, respectively. We also draw a connection between our algorithms and existing optimizers. Experimental results on training GPT-2 models indicate that MARS consistently outperforms AdamW by a large margin.|Huizhuo Yuan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10438)|null|

Recent works have attempted to apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance the performance of MLLMs, but have shown inconsistent improvements in mitigating hallucinations. To address this issue more effectively, we introduce Hallucination-targeted Direct Preference Optimization (HDPO) to reduce hallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike previous approaches, our method tackles hallucinations from their diverse forms and causes. Specifically, we develop three types of preference pair data targeting the following causes of MLLM hallucinations: (1) insufficient visual capabilities, (2) long context generation, and (3) multimodal conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple hallucination evaluation datasets, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and highlighting the potential of our approach. Ablation studies and in-depth analyses further confirm the effectiveness of our method and suggest the potential for further improvements through scaling up.|Yuhan Fu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10436)|null|

This paper introduces a simulation framework utilizing the game Balderdash to evaluate both the creativity and logical reasoning of LLMs. In Balderdash, players generate fictitious definitions for obscure terms to deceive others while identifying correct definitions. Our framework enables multiple LLM agents to participate in this game, assessing their ability to produce plausible definitions and strategize based on game rules and history. We implemented a centralized game engine featuring various LLMs as participants and a judge LLM to evaluate semantic equivalence. Through a series of experiments, we analyzed the performance of different LLMs, examining metrics such as True Definition Ratio, Deception Ratio, and Correct Guess Ratio. The results provide insights into the creative and deceptive capabilities of LLMs, highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement. Specifically, the study reveals that infrequent vocabulary in LLMs' input leads to poor reasoning on game rules and historical context (https://github.com/ParsaHejabi/Simulation-Framework-for-Multi-Agent-Balderdash).|Parsa Hejabi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10422)|**[link](https://github.com/parsahejabi/simulation-framework-for-multi-agent-balderdash)**|

Unlike the previous text-only Llama Guard versions (Inan et al., 2023; Llama Team, 2024b,a), it is specifically designed to support image reasoning use cases and is optimized to detect harmful multimodal (text and image) prompts and text responses to these prompts. Llama Guard 3 Vision is fine-tuned on Llama 3.2-Vision and demonstrates strong performance on the internal benchmarks using the MLCommons taxonomy. We also test its robustness against adversarial attacks.

However, a notable research gap exists in the evaluation of social biases that may be present in the code produced by LLMs. To solve this issue, we propose a novel fairness framework, i.e., Solar, to assess and mitigate the social biases of LLM-generated code. Specifically, Solar can automatically generate test cases for quantitatively uncovering social biases of the auto-generated code by LLMs. To quantify the severity of social biases in generated code, we develop a dataset that covers a diverse set of social problems. We applied Solar and the crafted dataset to four state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation. Our evaluation reveals severe bias in the LLM-generated code from all the subject LLMs. Furthermore, we explore several strategies for bias mitigation, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, combining positive role-playing with CoT prompting and iterative prompting. Our experiments show that iterative prompting can effectively reduce social bias in LLM-generated code by up to 90%. Solar is highly extensible to evaluate new social problems.|Lin Ling et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10351)|null|

However, they struggle to extend this visual understanding to tasks requiring precise temporal localization, known as Video Temporal Grounding (VTG). To address this gap, we introduce Number-Prompt (NumPro), a novel method that empowers Vid-LLMs to bridge visual comprehension with temporal grounding by adding unique numerical identifiers to each video frame. Treating a video as a sequence of numbered frame images, NumPro transforms VTG into an intuitive process: flipping through manga panels in sequence. This allows Vid-LLMs to "read" event timelines, accurately linking visual content with corresponding temporal information. Our experiments demonstrate that NumPro significantly boosts VTG performance of top-tier Vid-LLMs without additional computational cost. Furthermore, fine-tuning on a NumPro-enhanced dataset defines a new state-of-the-art for VTG, surpassing previous top-performing methods by up to 6.9\% in mIoU for moment retrieval and 8.5\% in mAP for highlight detection.

However, they often encounter significant challenges due to inadequate alignment for fine-grained knowledge, which restricts their ability to accurately capture local details and attain a comprehensive global perception. While recent advancements have focused on aligning object expressions with grounding information, they typically lack explicit integration of object images, which contain affluent information beyond mere texts or coordinates. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel fine-grained visual knowledge alignment method that effectively aligns and integrates multi-scale knowledge of objects, including texts, coordinates, and images. This innovative method is underpinned by our multi-scale fine-grained enhancement data synthesis pipeline, which provides over 300K essential training data to enhance alignment and improve overall performance. Furthermore, we present TinyGroundingGPT, a series of compact models optimized for high-level alignments. With a scale of approximately 3B parameters, TinyGroundingGPT achieves outstanding results in grounding tasks while delivering performance comparable to larger MLLMs in complex visual scenarios.|Wei Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09691)|null|

We introduce a new task, Hallucination Reasoning, which classifies LLM-generated text into one of three categories: aligned, misaligned, and fabricated.

|**2024-11-14**|**Squeezed Attention: Accelerating Long Context Length LLM Inference**|Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts to perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.|Coleman Hooper et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09688)|null|

Once the model is ported, MLC facilitates inference on a variety of runtimes including C++, mobile, and the browser. We envision that MLC has the potential to bridge the gap between the landscape of increasingly capable music AI models and technology more familiar to music software developers. As a proof of concept, we build a web application that allows users to generate endless streams of multi-instrumental MIDI in the browser, either from scratch or conditioned on a prompt.

|**2024-11-14**|**PTR: Precision-Driven Tool Recommendation for Large Language Models**|By augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools, their capacity to solve complex problems has been significantly enhanced. However, despite ongoing advancements in the parsing capabilities of LLMs, incorporating all available tools simultaneously in the prompt remains impractical due to the vast number of external tools. Consequently, it is essential to provide LLMs with a precise set of tools tailored to the specific task, considering both quantity and quality. Current tool retrieval methods primarily focus on refining the ranking list of tools and directly packaging a fixed number of top-ranked tools as the tool set. However, these approaches often fail to equip LLMs with the optimal set of tools prior to execution, since the optimal number of tools for different tasks could be different, resulting in inefficiencies such as redundant or unsuitable tools, which impede immediate access to the most relevant tools. This paper addresses the challenge of recommending precise toolsets for LLMs. We introduce the problem of tool recommendation, define its scope, and propose a novel Precision-driven Tool Recommendation (PTR) approach. PTR captures an initial, concise set of tools by leveraging historical tool bundle usage and dynamically adjusts the tool set by performing tool matching, culminating in a multi-view-based tool addition. Additionally, we present a new dataset, RecTools, and a metric, TRACC, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of tool recommendation for LLMs. We further validate our design choices through comprehensive experiments, demonstrating promising accuracy across two open benchmarks and our RecTools dataset.|Hang Gao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09613)|null|

To effectively measure moral sentiments in natural language processing texts, it is crucial to utilize large, annotated datasets that provide nuanced understanding for accurate analysis and modeltraining. However, existing corpora, while valuable, often face linguistic limitations. To address this gap in the Chinese language domain,we introduce the Moral Foundation Weibo Corpus. This corpus consists of 25,671 Chinese comments on Weibo, encompassing six diverse topic areas. Each comment is manually annotated by at least three systematically trained annotators based on ten moral categories derived from a grounded theory of morality. To assess annotator reliability, we present the kappa testresults, a gold standard for measuring consistency. Additionally, we apply several the latest large language models to supplement the manual annotations, conducting analytical experiments to compare their performance and report baseline results for moral sentiment classification.|Renjie Cao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09612)|null|

We have identified RAG evaluation as a barrier to continued progress in information access (and more broadly, natural language processing and artificial intelligence), and it is our hope that we can contribute to tackling the many challenges in this space. The central hypothesis we explore in this work is that the nugget evaluation methodology, originally developed for the TREC Question Answering Track in 2003, provides a solid foundation for evaluating RAG systems. As such, our efforts have focused on "refactoring" this methodology, specifically applying large language models to both automatically create nuggets and to automatically assign nuggets to system answers. We call this the AutoNuggetizer framework. Within the TREC setup, we are able to calibrate our fully automatic process against a manual process whereby nuggets are created by human assessors semi-manually and then assigned manually to system answers. Based on initial results across 21 topics from 45 runs, we observe a strong correlation between scores derived from a fully automatic nugget evaluation and a (mostly) manual nugget evaluation by human assessors. This suggests that our fully automatic evaluation process can be used to guide future iterations of RAG systems.|Ronak Pradeep et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09607)|null|

|**2024-11-13**|**The Limited Impact of Medical Adaptation of Large Language and Vision-Language Models**|Several recent works seek to develop foundation models specifically for medical applications, adapting general-purpose large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) via continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) improves performance on downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical licensing exam questions. In this paper, we compare ten public "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning regimes for medical question-answering (QA). For instance, across all tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs only outperform their base models in 22.7% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 36.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in the remaining 40.5% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model head-to-head, directly against the corresponding base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately in zero-/few-shot prompting; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. While these basic practices are not consistently adopted in the literature, our ablations show that they substantially impact conclusions. Meanwhile, we find that after fine-tuning on specific QA tasks, medical LLMs can show performance improvements, but the benefits do not carry over to tasks based on clinical notes. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.|Daniel P.

|**2024-11-13**|**Multimodal Instruction Tuning with Hybrid State Space Models**|Handling lengthy context is crucial for enhancing the recognition and understanding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in applications such as processing high-resolution images or high frame rate videos. The rise in image resolution and frame rate substantially increases computational demands due to the increased number of input tokens. This challenge is further exacerbated by the quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length of the self-attention mechanism. Most prior works either pre-train models with long contexts, overlooking the efficiency problem, or attempt to reduce the context length via downsampling (e.g., identify the key image patches or frames) to decrease the context length, which may result in information loss. To circumvent this issue while keeping the remarkable effectiveness of MLLMs, we propose a novel approach using a hybrid transformer-MAMBA model to efficiently handle long contexts in multimodal applications. Our multimodal model can effectively process long context input exceeding 100k tokens, outperforming existing models across various benchmarks. Remarkably, our model enhances inference efficiency for high-resolution images and high-frame-rate videos by about 4 times compared to current models, with efficiency gains increasing as image resolution or video frames rise. Furthermore, our model is the first to be trained on low-resolution images or low-frame-rate videos while being capable of inference on high-resolution images and high-frame-rate videos, offering flexibility for inference in diverse scenarios.|Jianing Zhou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08840)|null|

While Generative AI (GenAI) has attracted significant attention in this field, existing AI solutions often fall short due to their narrow focus on technical factors and limited capacity for discretionary judgment. These limitations hinder their ability to adapt to new data in real-time and accurately assess risks, which diminishes their practical value for investors.   This paper presents FinRobot, the first AI agent framework specifically designed for equity research. FinRobot employs a multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) system, integrating both quantitative and qualitative analyses to emulate the comprehensive reasoning of a human analyst. The system is structured around three specialized agents: the Data-CoT Agent, which aggregates diverse data sources for robust financial integration; the Concept-CoT Agent, which mimics an analysts reasoning to generate actionable insights; and the Thesis-CoT Agent, which synthesizes these insights into a coherent investment thesis and report. FinRobot provides thorough company analysis supported by precise numerical data, industry-appropriate valuation metrics, and realistic risk assessments. Its dynamically updatable data pipeline ensures that research remains timely and relevant, adapting seamlessly to new financial information. Unlike existing automated research tools, such as CapitalCube and Wright Reports, FinRobot delivers insights comparable to those produced by major brokerage firms and fundamental research vendors.

Recent work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as general world simulators to simulate the dynamics of the world due to their generalizability. LLMs also serve as the world model for deliberative reasoning in Reasoning via Planning (RAP) and Tree of Thought (ToT). However, the world models are either evaluated as a general world simulator, or as a functional module of the agent, i.e., predicting the transitions to assist the planning. In this work, we propose a comprehensive evaluation of the world models with LLMs from the decision making perspective. Specifically, we leverage the 31 diverse environments from (Wang et al., 2023;2024) and curate the rule-based policy of each environment for the diverse evaluation. Then, we design three main tasks, i.e., policy verification, action proposal, and policy planning, where the world models can be used for decision making solely. Finally, we conduct the comprehensive evaluation of the advanced LLMs, i.e., GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, on the environments for the three main tasks under various settings. The key observations include: i) GPT-4o significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini on the three main tasks, especially for the tasks which require the domain knowledge, ii) the performance of the world model with LLM will be decreased for long-term decision-making tasks, and iii) the combination of different functionalities of the world model will brings additional unstabilities of the performance.|Chang Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08794)|null|
|**2024-11-13**|**Can sparse autoencoders be used to decompose and interpret steering vectors?**|Steering vectors are a promising approach to control the behaviour of large language models. However, their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) may offer a potential method to interpret steering vectors, recent findings show that SAE-reconstructed vectors often lack the steering properties of the original vectors. This paper investigates why directly applying SAEs to steering vectors yields misleading decompositions, identifying two reasons: (1) steering vectors fall outside the input distribution for which SAEs are designed, and (2) steering vectors can have meaningful negative projections in feature directions, which SAEs are not designed to accommodate. These limitations hinder the direct use of SAEs for interpreting steering vectors.|Harry Mayne et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08790)|**[link](https://github.com/harrymayne/sv_interpretability)**|
|**2024-11-13**|**Separating Tongue from Thought: Activation Patching Reveals Language-Agnostic Concept Representations in Transformers**|A central question in multilingual language modeling is whether large language models (LLMs) develop a universal concept representation, disentangled from specific languages. In this paper, we address this question by analyzing latent representations (latents) during a word translation task in transformer-based LLMs. We strategically extract latents from a source translation prompt and insert them into the forward pass on a target translation prompt. By doing so, we find that the output language is encoded in the latent at an earlier layer than the concept to be translated. Building on this insight, we conduct two key experiments. First, we demonstrate that we can change the concept without changing the language and vice versa through activation patching alone. Second, we show that patching with the mean over latents across different languages does not impair and instead improves the models' performance in translating the concept. Our results provide evidence for the existence of language-agnostic concept representations within the investigated models.|Clément Dumas et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08745)|**[link](https://github.com/butanium/llm-lang-agnostic)**|

Compared to most studies that focus on continuous speech features, although discrete-token based LLMs have shown promising results on certain tasks, the performance gap between these two paradigms is rarely explored. In this paper, we present a fair and thorough comparison between discrete and continuous features across a variety of semantic-related tasks using a light-weight LLM (Qwen1.5-0.5B). Our findings reveal that continuous features generally outperform discrete tokens, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained semantic understanding. Moreover, this study goes beyond surface-level comparison by identifying key factors behind the under-performance of discrete tokens, such as limited token granularity and inefficient information retention. To enhance the performance of discrete tokens, we explore potential aspects based on our analysis. We hope our results can offer new insights into the opportunities for advancing discrete speech tokens in Speech LLMs.|Dingdong Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08742)|null|
|**2024-11-14**|**Dynamic Rewarding with Prompt Optimization Enables Tuning-free Self-Alignment of Language Models**|Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) traditionally relies on costly training and human preference annotations. Self-alignment seeks to reduce these expenses by enabling models to align themselves. To further lower costs and achieve alignment without any expensive tuning or annotations, we introduce a new tuning-free approach for self-alignment, Dynamic Rewarding with Prompt Optimization (DRPO). Our approach leverages a search-based optimization framework that allows LLMs to iteratively self-improve and craft the optimal alignment instructions, all without additional training or human intervention. The core of DRPO is a dynamic rewarding mechanism, which identifies and rectifies model-specific alignment weaknesses, allowing LLMs to adapt efficiently to diverse alignment challenges. Empirical evaluations on eight recent LLMs, both open- and closed-sourced, demonstrate that DRPO significantly enhances alignment performance, with base models outperforming their SFT/RLHF-tuned counterparts. Moreover, the prompts automatically optimized by DRPO surpass those curated by human experts, further validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings highlight the great potential of current LLMs to achieve adaptive self-alignment through inference-time optimization, complementing tuning-based alignment methods.|Somanshu Singla et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08733)|null|
|**2024-11-12**|**Learning with Less: Knowledge Distillation from Large Language Models via Unlabeled Data**|In real-world NLP applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions due to their extensive training on vast datasets. However, the large size and high computation demands of LLMs limit their practicality in many applications, especially when further fine-tuning is required. To address these limitations, smaller models are typically preferred for deployment. However, their training is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data. In contrast, unlabeled data is often readily which can be leveraged by using LLMs to generate pseudo-labels for training smaller models. This enables the smaller models (student) to acquire knowledge from LLMs(teacher) while reducing computational costs. This process introduces challenges, such as potential noisy pseudo-labels. Selecting high-quality and informative data is therefore critical to enhance model performance while improving the efficiency of data utilization. To address this, we propose LLKD that enables Learning with Less computational resources and less data for Knowledge Distillation from LLMs. LLKD is an adaptive sample selection method that incorporates signals from both the teacher and student. Specifically, it prioritizes samples where the teacher demonstrates high confidence in its labeling, indicating reliable labels, and where the student exhibits a high information need, identifying challenging samples that require further learning. Our comprehensive experiments show that LLKD achieves superior performance across various datasets with higher data efficiency.|Juanhui Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08028)|null|
|**2024-11-12**|**LLMPhy: Complex Physical Reasoning Using Large Language Models and World Models**|Physical reasoning is an important skill needed for robotic agents when operating in the real world. However, solving such reasoning problems often involves hypothesizing and reflecting over complex multi-body interactions under the effect of a multitude of physical forces and thus learning all such interactions poses a significant hurdle for state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, including large language models (LLMs). To study this problem, we propose a new physical reasoning task and a dataset, dubbed TraySim. Our task involves predicting the dynamics of several objects on a tray that is given an external impact -- the domino effect of the ensued object interactions and their dynamics thus offering a challenging yet controlled setup, with the goal of reasoning being to infer the stability of the objects after the impact. To solve this complex physical reasoning task, we present LLMPhy, a zero-shot black-box optimization framework that leverages the physics knowledge and program synthesis abilities of LLMs, and synergizes these abilities with the world models built into modern physics engines. Specifically, LLMPhy uses an LLM to generate code to iteratively estimate the physical hyperparameters of the system (friction, damping, layout, etc.) via an implicit analysis-by-synthesis approach using a (non-differentiable) simulator in the loop and uses the inferred parameters to imagine the dynamics of the scene towards solving the reasoning task. To show the effectiveness of LLMPhy, we present experiments on our TraySim dataset to predict the steady-state poses of the objects. Our results show that the combination of the LLM and the physics engine leads to state-of-the-art zero-shot physical reasoning performance, while demonstrating superior convergence against standard black-box optimization methods and better estimation of the physical parameters.|Anoop Cherian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08027)|null|
|**2024-11-12**|**Language Models as Causal Effect Generators**|We present a framework for large language model (LLM) based data generation with controllable causal structure. In particular, we define a procedure for turning any language model and any directed acyclic graph (DAG) into a sequence-driven structural causal model (SD-SCM). Broadly speaking, an SD-SCM is a causal model with user-defined structure and LLM-defined structural equations. We characterize how an SD-SCM allows sampling from observational, interventional, and counterfactual distributions according to the desired causal structure. We then leverage this procedure to propose a new type of benchmark for causal inference methods, generating individual-level counterfactual data without needing to manually specify functional relationships between variables. We create an example benchmark consisting of thousands of datasets, and test a suite of popular estimation methods on these datasets for average, conditional average, and individual treatment effect estimation, both with and without hidden confounding. Apart from generating data, the same procedure also allows us to test for the presence of a causal effect that might be encoded in an LLM. This procedure can underpin auditing LLMs for misinformation, discrimination, or otherwise undesirable behavior. We believe SD-SCMs can serve as a useful tool in any application that would benefit from sequential data with controllable causal structure.|Lucius E. J.

This paper presents ExpressivityArena, a Python library for measuring the implicit communication abilities of LLMs. We provide a comprehensive framework to evaluate expressivity of arbitrary LLMs and explore its practical implications. To this end, we refine the definition and measurements of ``expressivity,'' and use our framework in a set of small experiments. These experiments test LLMs in creative and logical tasks such as poetry, coding, and emotion-based responses. They are then evaluated by an automated grader, through ExpressivityArena, which we verify to be the most pragmatic for testing expressivity. Building on these experiments, we deepen our understanding of the expressivity of LLMs by assessing their ability to remain expressive in conversations. Our findings indicate that LLMs are capable of generating and understanding expressive content, however, with some limitations. These insights will inform the future development and deployment of expressive LLMs. We provide the code for ExpressivityArena alongside our paper.|Joshua Tint et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08010)|null|
|**2024-11-12**|**Can adversarial attacks by large language models be attributed?**|Attributing outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) in adversarial settings-such as cyberattacks and disinformation-presents significant challenges that are likely to grow in importance. We investigate this attribution problem using formal language theory, specifically language identification in the limit as introduced by Gold and extended by Angluin. By modeling LLM outputs as formal languages, we analyze whether finite text samples can uniquely pinpoint the originating model. Our results show that due to the non-identifiability of certain language classes, under some mild assumptions about overlapping outputs from fine-tuned models it is theoretically impossible to attribute outputs to specific LLMs with certainty. This holds also when accounting for expressivity limitations of Transformer architectures. Even with direct model access or comprehensive monitoring, significant computational hurdles impede attribution efforts. These findings highlight an urgent need for proactive measures to mitigate risks posed by adversarial LLM use as their influence continues to expand.|Manuel Cebrian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08003)|null|
|**2024-11-12**|**Derivational Morphology Reveals Analogical Generalization in Large Language Models**|What mechanisms underlie linguistic generalization in large language models (LLMs)? This question has attracted considerable attention, with most studies analyzing the extent to which the language skills of LLMs resemble rules. As of yet, it is not known whether linguistic generalization in LLMs could equally well be explained as the result of analogical processes, which can be formalized as similarity operations on stored exemplars. A key shortcoming of prior research is its focus on linguistic phenomena with a high degree of regularity, for which rule-based and analogical approaches make the same predictions. Here, we instead examine derivational morphology, specifically English adjective nominalization, which displays notable variability. We introduce a new method for investigating linguistic generalization in LLMs: focusing on GPT-J, we fit cognitive models that instantiate rule-based and analogical learning to the LLM training data and compare their predictions on a set of nonce adjectives with those of the LLM, allowing us to draw direct conclusions regarding underlying mechanisms. As expected, rule-based and analogical models explain the predictions of GPT-J equally well for adjectives with regular nominalization patterns. However, for adjectives with variable nominalization patterns, the analogical model provides a much better match. Furthermore, GPT-J's behavior is sensitive to the individual word frequencies, even for regular forms, a behavior that is consistent with an analogical account of regular forms but not a rule-based one. These findings refute the hypothesis that GPT-J's linguistic generalization on adjective nominalization involves rules, suggesting similarity operations on stored exemplars as the underlying mechanism. Overall, our study suggests that analogical processes play a bigger role in the linguistic generalization of LLMs than previously thought.|Valentin Hofmann et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07990)|null|

JanusFlow introduces a minimalist architecture that integrates autoregressive language models with rectified flow, a state-of-the-art method in generative modeling. Our key finding demonstrates that rectified flow can be straightforwardly trained within the large language model framework, eliminating the need for complex architectural modifications. To further improve the performance of our unified model, we adopt two key strategies: (i) decoupling the understanding and generation encoders, and (ii) aligning their representations during unified training. Extensive experiments show that JanusFlow achieves comparable or superior performance to specialized models in their respective domains, while significantly outperforming existing unified approaches across standard benchmarks.

|**2024-11-12**|**From General to Specific: Utilizing General Hallucation to Automatically Measure the Role Relationship Fidelity for Specific Role-Play Agents**|The advanced role-playing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for developing Role-Playing Agents (RPAs). However, existing benchmarks, such as HPD, which incorporates manually scored character relationships into the context for LLMs to sort coherence, and SocialBench, which uses specific profiles generated by LLMs in the context of multiple-choice tasks to assess character preferences, face limitations like poor generalizability, implicit and inaccurate judgments, and excessive context length. To address the above issues, we propose an automatic, scalable, and generalizable paradigm. Specifically, we construct a benchmark by extracting relations from a general knowledge graph and leverage RPA's inherent hallucination properties to prompt it to interact across roles, employing ChatGPT for stance detection and defining relationship hallucination along with three related metrics. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and stability of our metrics. Our findings further explore factors influencing these metrics and discuss the trade-off between relationship hallucination and factuality.|Chuyi Kong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07965)|null|

However, as server LLMs continue to scale in size, they will need to be distributed across more devices, magnifying the communication cost. One way to approach this problem is with quantization, but current methods for LLMs tend to avoid quantizing the features that tensor parallelism needs to communicate. Taking advantage of consistent outliers in communicated features, we introduce a quantization method that reduces communicated values on average from 16 bits to 4.2 bits while preserving nearly all of the original performance. For instance, our method maintains around 98.0% and 99.5% of Gemma 2 27B's and Llama 2 13B's original performance, respectively, averaged across all tasks we evaluated on.|Harry Dong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07942)|null|

However, their evaluations are narrow in scope, leaving a large gap in understanding the benefits of tools across diverse chemistry tasks. To bridge this gap, we develop ChemAgent, an enhanced chemistry agent over ChemCrow, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its performance on both specialized chemistry tasks and general chemistry questions. Surprisingly, ChemAgent does not consistently outperform its base LLMs without tools. Our error analysis with a chemistry expert suggests that: For specialized chemistry tasks, such as synthesis prediction, we should augment agents with specialized tools; however, for general chemistry questions like those in exams, agents' ability to reason correctly with chemistry knowledge matters more, and tool augmentation does not always help.|Botao Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07228)|null|
|**2024-11-11**|**Comparing Bottom-Up and Top-Down Steering Approaches on In-Context Learning Tasks**|A key objective of interpretability research on large language models (LLMs) is to develop methods for robustly steering models toward desired behaviors. To this end, two distinct approaches to interpretability -- ``bottom-up" and ``top-down" -- have been presented, but there has been little quantitative comparison between them. We present a case study comparing the effectiveness of representative vector steering methods from each branch: function vectors (FV; arXiv:2310.15213), as a bottom-up method, and in-context vectors (ICV; arXiv:2311.06668) as a top-down method. While both aim to capture compact representations of broad in-context learning tasks, we find they are effective only on specific types of tasks: ICVs outperform FVs in behavioral shifting, whereas FVs excel in tasks requiring more precision. We discuss the implications for future evaluations of steering methods and for further research into top-down and bottom-up steering given these findings.|Madeline Brumley et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07213)|null|
|**2024-11-11**|**DLCR: A Generative Data Expansion Framework via Diffusion for Clothes-Changing Person Re-ID**|With the recent exhibited strength of generative diffusion models, an open research question is \textit{if images generated by these models can be used to learn better visual representations}. While this generative data expansion may suffice for easier visual tasks, we explore its efficacy on a more difficult discriminative task: clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID). CC-ReID aims to match people appearing in non-overlapping cameras, even when they change their clothes across cameras. Not only are current CC-ReID models constrained by the limited diversity of clothing in current CC-ReID datasets, but generating additional data that retains important personal features for accurate identification is a current challenge. To address this issue we propose DLCR, a novel data expansion framework that leverages pre-trained diffusion and large language models (LLMs) to accurately generate diverse images of individuals in varied attire. We generate additional data for five benchmark CC-ReID datasets (PRCC, CCVID, LaST, VC-Clothes, and LTCC) and \textbf{increase their clothing diversity by \boldmath{ $10$}x, totaling over \boldmath{$2.1$}M images generated}. DLCR employs diffusion-based text-guided inpainting, conditioned on clothing prompts constructed using LLMs, to generate synthetic data that only modifies a subject's clothes while preserving their personally identifiable features. With this massive increase in data, we introduce two novel strategies - progressive learning and test-time prediction refinement - that respectively reduce training time and further boosts CC-ReID performance. On the PRCC dataset, we obtain a large top-1 accuracy improvement of $11.3\%$ by training CAL, a previous state of the art (SOTA) method, with DLCR-generated data.

|**2024-11-11**|**The Super Weight in Large Language Models**|Recent works have shown a surprising result: a small fraction of Large Language Model (LLM) parameter outliers are disproportionately important to the quality of the model. LLMs contain billions of parameters, so these small fractions, such as 0.01%, translate to hundreds of thousands of parameters. In this work, we present an even more surprising finding: Pruning as few as a single parameter can destroy an LLM's ability to generate text -- increasing perplexity by 3 orders of magnitude and reducing zero-shot accuracy to guessing. We propose a data-free method for identifying such parameters, termed super weights, using a single forward pass through the model. We additionally find that these super weights induce correspondingly rare and large activation outliers, termed super activations. When preserved with high precision, super activations can improve simple round-to-nearest quantization to become competitive with state-of-the-art methods. For weight quantization, we similarly find that by preserving the super weight and clipping other weight outliers, round-to-nearest quantization can scale to much larger block sizes than previously considered. To facilitate further research into super weights, we provide an index of super weight coordinates for common, openly available LLMs.|Mengxia Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07191)|**[link](https://github.com/mengxiayu/llmsuperweight)**|

|**2024-11-11**|**Continual Memorization of Factoids in Large Language Models**|Large language models can absorb a massive amount of knowledge through pretraining, but pretraining is inefficient for acquiring long-tailed or specialized facts. Therefore, fine-tuning on specialized or new knowledge that reflects changes in the world has become popular, though it risks disrupting the model's original capabilities. We study this fragility in the context of continual memorization, where the model is trained on a small set of long-tail factoids (factual associations) and must retain these factoids after multiple stages of subsequent training on other datasets. Through extensive experiments, we show that LLMs suffer from forgetting across a wide range of subsequent tasks, and simple replay techniques do not fully prevent forgetting, especially when the factoid datasets are trained in the later stages. We posit that there are two ways to alleviate forgetting: 1) protect the memorization process as the model learns the factoids, or 2) reduce interference from training in later stages. With this insight, we develop an effective mitigation strategy: REMIX (Random and Generic Data Mixing). REMIX prevents forgetting by mixing generic data sampled from pretraining corpora or even randomly generated word sequences during each stage, despite being unrelated to the memorized factoids in the first stage. REMIX can recover performance from severe forgetting, often outperforming replay-based methods that have access to the factoids from the first stage. We then analyze how REMIX alters the learning process and find that successful forgetting prevention is associated with a pattern: the model stores factoids in earlier layers than usual and diversifies the set of layers that store these factoids. The efficacy of REMIX invites further investigation into the underlying dynamics of memorization and forgetting, opening exciting possibilities for future research.|Howard Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07175)|**[link](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/continual-factoid-memorization)**|

However, traditional frequency-based, data-driven neural network-based approaches can miss newly relevant content due to the evolving nature of language in a dynamically evolving environment. Human-curated symbolic knowledge sources, such as lexicons for standard language and slang terms, can potentially elevate social media signals in evolving language. We introduce a neurosymbolic method that integrates neural networks with symbolic knowledge sources, enhancing the detection and interpretation of mental health-related tweets relevant to COVID-19. Our method was evaluated using a corpus of large datasets (approximately 12 billion tweets, 2.5 million subreddit data, and 700k news articles) and multiple knowledge graphs. This method dynamically adapts to evolving language, outperforming purely data-driven models with an F1 score exceeding 92\%. This approach also showed faster adaptation to new data and lower computational demands than fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs). This study demonstrates the benefit of neurosymbolic methods in interpreting text in a dynamic environment for tasks such as health surveillance.|Vedant Khandelwal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07163)|null|

|**2024-11-08**|**Recycled Attention: Efficient inference for long-context language models**|Generating long sequences of tokens given a long-context input imposes a heavy computational burden for large language models (LLMs). One of the computational bottleneck comes from computing attention over a long sequence of input at each generation step. In this paper, we propose Recycled Attention, an inference-time method which alternates between full context attention and attention over a subset of input tokens. When performing partial attention, we recycle the attention pattern of a previous token that has performed full attention and attend only to the top K most attended tokens, reducing the cost of data movement and attention computation. Compared to previously proposed inference-time acceleration method which attends only to local context or tokens with high accumulative attention scores, our approach flexibly chooses tokens that are relevant to the current decoding step. We evaluate our methods on RULER, a suite of tasks designed to comprehensively evaluate long-context abilities, and long-context language modeling tasks. Applying our method to off-the-shelf LLMs achieves comparable speedup to baselines which only consider local context while improving the performance by 2x. We further explore two ideas to improve performance-efficiency trade-offs: (1) dynamically decide when to perform recycled or full attention step based on the query similarities and (2) continued pre-training the model with Recycled Attention.|Fangyuan Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05787)|null|

Under this mental model, LLMs should be thought of as actors; prompts as scripts and cues; and LLM responses as performances. We apply this mental model to the task of improving LLM performance at playing Connections, a New York Times word puzzle game that prior research identified as a challenging benchmark for evaluating LLM reasoning. Our experiments with GPT-4o show that a "Method Actors" approach can significantly improve LLM performance over both a vanilla and "Chain of Thoughts" approach. A vanilla approach solves 27% of Connections puzzles in our dataset and a "Chain of Thoughts" approach solves 41% of puzzles, whereas our strongest "Method Actor" approach solves 86% of puzzles. We also test OpenAI's newest model designed specifically for complex reasoning tasks, o1-preview. When asked to solve a puzzle all at once, o1-preview solves 79% of Connections puzzles in our dataset, and when allowed to build puzzle solutions one guess at a time over multiple API calls, o1-preview solves 100% of the puzzles. Incorporating a "Method Actor" prompt architecture increases the percentage of puzzles that o1-preview solves perfectly from 76% to 87%.|Colin Doyle et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05778)|null|
|**2024-11-08**|**Quantitative Assessment of Intersectional Empathetic Bias and Understanding**|A growing amount of literature critiques the current operationalizations of empathy based on loose definitions of the construct. Such definitions negatively affect dataset quality, model robustness, and evaluation reliability. We propose an empathy evaluation framework that operationalizes empathy close to its psychological origins. The framework measures the variance in responses of LLMs to prompts using existing metrics for empathy and emotional valence. The variance is introduced through the controlled generation of the prompts by varying social biases affecting context understanding, thus impacting empathetic understanding. The control over generation ensures high theoretical validity of the constructs in the prompt dataset. Also, it makes high-quality translation, especially into languages that currently have little-to-no way of evaluating empathy or bias, such as the Slavonic family, more manageable. Using chosen LLMs and various prompt types, we demonstrate the empathy evaluation with the framework, including multiple-choice answers and free generation. The variance in our initial evaluation sample is small and we were unable to measure convincing differences between the empathetic understanding in contexts given by different social groups. However, the results are promising because the models showed significant alterations their reasoning chains needed to capture the relatively subtle changes in the prompts. This provides the basis for future research into the construction of the evaluation sample and statistical methods for measuring the results.|Vojtech Formanek et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05777)|null|

Can LLMs be Reliable Annotators for Political Truths?**|Political misinformation poses significant challenges to democratic processes, shaping public opinion and trust in media. Manual fact-checking methods face issues of scalability and annotator bias, while machine learning models require large, costly labelled datasets. This study investigates the use of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) as reliable annotators for detecting political factuality in news articles. Using open-source LLMs, we create a politically diverse dataset, labelled for bias through LLM-generated annotations. These annotations are validated by human experts and further evaluated by LLM-based judges to assess the accuracy and reliability of the annotations. Our approach offers a scalable and robust alternative to traditional fact-checking, enhancing transparency and public trust in media.|Veronica Chatrath et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05775)|null|

FinDVer contains 2,400 expert-annotated examples, divided into three subsets: information extraction, numerical reasoning, and knowledge-intensive reasoning, each addressing common scenarios encountered in real-world financial contexts. We assess a broad spectrum of LLMs under long-context and RAG settings. Our results show that even the current best-performing system, GPT-4o, still lags behind human experts. We further provide in-depth analysis on long-context and RAG setting, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, and model reasoning errors, offering insights to drive future advancements. We believe that FinDVer can serve as a valuable benchmark for evaluating LLMs in claim verification over complex, expert-domain documents.|Yilun Zhao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05764)|null|
|**2024-11-08**|**Multi-hop Evidence Pursuit Meets the Web: Team Papelo at FEVER 2024**|Separating disinformation from fact on the web has long challenged both the search and the reasoning powers of humans. We show that the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) and the retrieval power of modern search engines can be combined to automate this process and explainably verify claims. We integrate LLMs and search under a multi-hop evidence pursuit strategy. This strategy generates an initial question based on an input claim using a sequence to sequence model, searches and formulates an answer to the question, and iteratively generates follow-up questions to pursue the evidence that is missing using an LLM. We demonstrate our system on the FEVER 2024 (AVeriTeC) shared task. Compared to a strategy of generating all the questions at once, our method obtains .045 higher label accuracy and .155 higher AVeriTeC score (evaluating the adequacy of the evidence). Through ablations, we show the importance of various design choices, such as the question generation method, medium-sized context, reasoning with one document at a time, adding metadata, paraphrasing, reducing the problem to two classes, and reconsidering the final verdict. Our submitted system achieves .510 AVeriTeC score on the dev set and .477 AVeriTeC score on the test set.|Christopher Malon et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05762)|null|
|**2024-11-08**|**Tell What You Hear From What You See -- Video to Audio Generation Through Text**|The content of visual and audio scenes is multi-faceted such that a video can be paired with various audio and vice-versa. Thereby, in video-to-audio generation task, it is imperative to introduce steering approaches for controlling the generated audio. While Video-to-Audio generation is a well-established generative task, existing methods lack such controllability. In this work, we propose VATT, a multi-modal generative framework that takes a video and an optional text prompt as input, and generates audio and optional textual description of the audio. Such a framework has two advantages: i) Video-to-Audio generation process can be refined and controlled via text which complements the context of visual information, and ii) The model can suggest what audio to generate for the video by generating audio captions. VATT consists of two key modules: VATT Converter, a LLM that is fine-tuned for instructions and includes a projection layer that maps video features to the LLM vector space; and VATT Audio, a transformer that generates audio tokens from visual frames and from optional text prompt using iterative parallel decoding. The audio tokens are converted to a waveform by pretrained neural codec. Experiments show that when VATT is compared to existing video-to-audio generation methods in objective metrics, it achieves competitive performance when the audio caption is not provided. When the audio caption is provided as a prompt, VATT achieves even more refined performance (lowest KLD score of 1.41). Furthermore, subjective studies show that VATT Audio has been chosen as preferred generated audio than audio generated by existing methods. VATT enables controllable video-to-audio generation through text as well as suggesting text prompts for videos through audio captions, unlocking novel applications such as text-guided video-to-audio generation and video-to-audio captioning.|Xiulong Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05679)|null|
|**2024-11-08**|**Unmasking the Limits of Large Language Models: A Systematic Evaluation of Masked Text Processing Ability through MskQA and MskCal**|This paper sheds light on the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by rigorously evaluating their ability to process masked text. We introduce two novel tasks: MskQA, measuring reasoning on masked question-answering datasets like RealtimeQA, and MskCal, assessing numerical reasoning on masked arithmetic problems.Testing GPT-4o and 4o-mini reveals that while LLMs exhibit some resilience to masked text, their performance is highly contingent on masking rates and semantic cues. Specifically, "solid masking," where semantic clues are entirely absent, leads to a significant performance drop compared to "partial lifting," where some semantic information is retained, indicating LLMs' reliance on surface-level patterns. Interestingly, GPT-4o consistently outperforms 4o-mini, particularly in MskCal, demonstrating a greater ability to handle numerical reasoning with masked text. This underscores the crucial role of semantic cues in the reasoning process of LLMs. Our study illuminates the interplay between background knowledge and reasoning ability in masked text processing, paving the way for a deeper understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations, and highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods to accurately assess their true comprehension abilities.|Fuka Matsuzaki et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05665)|**[link](https://github.com/isfhub/maskcode)**|
|**2024-11-08**|**The influence of persona and conversational task on social interactions with a LLM-controlled embodied conversational agent**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in conversational tasks. Embodying an LLM as a virtual human allows users to engage in face-to-face social interactions in Virtual Reality. However, the influence of person- and task-related factors in social interactions with LLM-controlled agents remains unclear. In this study, forty-six participants interacted with a virtual agent whose persona was manipulated as extravert or introvert in three different conversational tasks (small talk, knowledge test, convincing). Social-evaluation, emotional experience, and realism were assessed using ratings. Interactive engagement was measured by quantifying participants' words and conversational turns. Finally, we measured participants' willingness to ask the agent for help during the knowledge test. Our findings show that the extraverted agent was more positively evaluated, elicited a more pleasant experience and greater engagement, and was assessed as more realistic compared to the introverted agent. Whereas persona did not affect the tendency to ask for help, participants were generally more confident in the answer when they had help of the LLM. Variation of personality traits of LLM-controlled embodied virtual agents, therefore, affects social-emotional processing and behavior in virtual interactions. Embodied virtual agents allow the presentation of naturalistic social encounters in a virtual environment.|Leon O. H. Kroczek et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05653)|null|
|**2024-11-07**|**SVDQunat: Absorbing Outliers by Low-Rank Components for 4-Bit Diffusion Models**|Diffusion models have been proven highly effective at generating high-quality images. However, as these models grow larger, they require significantly more memory and suffer from higher latency, posing substantial challenges for deployment. In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing their weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both weights and activations are highly sensitive, where conventional post-training quantization methods for large language models like smoothing become insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit quantization paradigm. Different from smoothing which redistributes outliers between weights and activations, our approach absorbs these outliers using a low-rank branch. We first consolidate the outliers by shifting them from activations to weights, then employ a high-precision low-rank branch to take in the weight outliers with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This process eases the quantization on both sides. However, na\"{\i}vely running the low-rank branch independently incurs significant overhead due to extra data movement of activations, negating the quantization speedup. To address this, we co-design an inference engine Nunchaku that fuses the kernels of the low-rank branch into those of the low-bit branch to cut off redundant memory access. It can also seamlessly support off-the-shelf low-rank adapters (LoRAs) without the need for re-quantization. Extensive experiments on SDXL, PixArt- $\Sigma$, and FLUX.1 validate the effectiveness of SVDQuant in preserving image quality. We reduce the memory usage for the 12B FLUX.1 models by 3.5$\times$, achieving 3.0$\times$ speedup over the 4-bit weight-only quantized baseline on the 16GB laptop 4090 GPU, paving the way for more interactive applications on PCs.

|**2024-11-07**|**Needle Threading: Can LLMs Follow Threads through Near-Million-Scale Haystacks?**|As the context limits of Large Language Models (LLMs) increase, the range of possible applications and downstream functions broadens. In many real-world tasks, decisions depend on details scattered across collections of often disparate documents containing mostly irrelevant information. Long-context LLMs appear well-suited to this form of complex information retrieval and reasoning, which has traditionally proven costly and time-consuming. However, although the development of longer context models has seen rapid gains in recent years, our understanding of how effectively LLMs use their context has not kept pace. To address this, we conduct a set of retrieval experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities of 17 leading LLMs, such as their ability to follow threads of information through the context window. Strikingly, we find that many models are remarkably threadsafe: capable of simultaneously following multiple threads without significant loss in performance. Still, for many models, we find the effective context limit is significantly shorter than the supported context length, with accuracy decreasing as the context window grows. Our study also highlights the important point that token counts from different tokenizers should not be directly compared -- they often correspond to substantially different numbers of written characters. We release our code and long-context experimental data.|Jonathan Roberts et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05000)|null|
|**2024-11-07**|**DynaMem: Online Dynamic Spatio-Semantic Memory for Open World Mobile Manipulation**|Significant progress has been made in open-vocabulary mobile manipulation, where the goal is for a robot to perform tasks in any environment given a natural language description. However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system's applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot's own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot's environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models. Powered by DynaMem, our robots can explore novel environments, search for objects not found in memory, and continuously update the memory as objects move, appear, or disappear in the scene. We run extensive experiments on the Stretch SE3 robots in three real and nine offline scenes, and achieve an average pick-and-drop success rate of 70% on non-stationary objects, which is more than a 2x improvement over state-of-the-art static systems.

|**2024-11-07**|**LLM2CLIP: Powerful Language Model Unlock Richer Visual Representation**|CLIP is one of the most important multimodal foundational models today. What powers CLIP's capabilities? The rich supervision signals provided by natural language, the carrier of human knowledge, shape a powerful cross-modal representation space. However, with the rapid advancements in large language models LLMs like GPT-4 and LLaMA, the boundaries of language comprehension and generation are continually being pushed. This raises an intriguing question: can the capabilities of LLMs be harnessed to further improve multimodal representation learning? The potential benefits of incorporating LLMs into CLIP are clear. LLMs' strong textual understanding can fundamentally improve CLIP's ability to handle image captions, drastically enhancing its ability to process long and complex texts, a well-known limitation of vanilla CLIP. Moreover, LLMs are trained on a vast corpus of text, possessing open-world knowledge. This allows them to expand on caption information during training, increasing the efficiency of the learning process. In this paper, we propose LLM2CLIP, a novel approach that embraces the power of LLMs to unlock CLIP's potential. By fine-tuning the LLM in the caption space with contrastive learning, we extract its textual capabilities into the output embeddings, significantly improving the output layer's textual discriminability. We then design an efficient training process where the fine-tuned LLM acts as a powerful teacher for CLIP's visual encoder. Thanks to the LLM's presence, we can now incorporate longer and more complex captions without being restricted by vanilla CLIP's text encoder's context window and ability limitations. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach brings substantial improvements in cross-modal tasks.|Weiquan Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04997)|**[link](https://github.com/microsoft/LLM2CLIP)**|

Training these models demands significantly larger datasets and computational resources compared to text-only LLMs. To address the scaling challenges, we introduce Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a sparse multi-modal transformer architecture that significantly reduces pretraining computational costs. MoT decouples non-embedding parameters of the model by modality -- including feed-forward networks, attention matrices, and layer normalization -- enabling modality-specific processing with global self-attention over the full input sequence. We evaluate MoT across multiple settings and model scales. In the Chameleon 7B setting (autoregressive text-and-image generation), MoT matches the dense baseline's performance using only 55.8\% of the FLOPs. When extended to include speech, MoT reaches speech performance comparable to the dense baseline with only 37.2\% of the FLOPs. In the Transfusion setting, where text and image are trained with different objectives, a 7B MoT model matches the image modality performance of the dense baseline with one third of the FLOPs, and a 760M MoT model outperforms a 1.4B dense baseline across key image generation metrics. System profiling further highlights MoT's practical benefits, achieving dense baseline image quality in 47.2\% of the wall-clock time and text quality in 75.6\% of the wall-clock time (measured on AWS p4de.24xlarge instances with NVIDIA A100 GPUs).|Weixin Liang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04996)|null|
|**2024-11-07**|**Rethinking Bradley-Terry Models in Preference-Based Reward Modeling: Foundations, Theory, and Alternatives**|The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is a common and successful practice in reward modeling for Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. However, it remains unclear why this model -- originally developed for multi-player stochastic game matching -- can be adopted to convert pairwise response comparisons to reward values and make predictions. Especially given the fact that only a limited number of prompt-response pairs are sparsely compared with others. In this paper, we first revisit the foundations of using BT models in reward modeling, and establish the convergence rate of BT reward models based on deep neural networks using embeddings, providing a theoretical foundation for their use. Despite theoretically sound, we argue that the BT model is not a necessary choice from the perspective of downstream optimization. This is because a reward model only needs to preserve the correct ranking predictions through a monotonic transformation of the true reward. We highlight the critical concept of order consistency in reward modeling and demonstrate that the BT model possesses this property. Consequently, we propose a simple and straightforward upper-bound algorithm, compatible with off-the-shelf binary classifiers, as an alternative order-consistent reward modeling objective. To offer practical insights, we empirically evaluate the performance of these different reward modeling approaches across more than 12,000 experimental setups, using $6$ base LLMs, $2$ datasets, and diverse annotation designs that vary in quantity, quality, and pairing choices in preference annotations.|Hao Sun et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04991)|**[link](https://github.com/holarissun/rewardmodelingbeyondbradleyterry)**|
|**2024-11-07**|**Enhancing Reverse Engineering: Investigating and Benchmarking Large Language Models for Vulnerability Analysis in Decompiled Binaries**|Security experts reverse engineer (decompile) binary code to identify critical security vulnerabilities. The limited access to source code in vital systems - such as firmware, drivers, and proprietary software used in Critical Infrastructures (CI) - makes this analysis even more crucial on the binary level. Even with available source code, a semantic gap persists after compilation between the source and the binary code executed by the processor. This gap may hinder the detection of vulnerabilities in source code. That being said, current research on Large Language Models (LLMs) overlooks the significance of decompiled binaries in this area by focusing solely on source code. In this work, we are the first to empirically uncover the substantial semantic limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs when it comes to analyzing vulnerabilities in decompiled binaries, largely due to the absence of relevant datasets. To bridge the gap, we introduce DeBinVul, a novel decompiled binary code vulnerability dataset. Our dataset is multi-architecture and multi-optimization, focusing on C/C++ due to their wide usage in CI and association with numerous vulnerabilities. Specifically, we curate 150,872 samples of vulnerable and non-vulnerable decompiled binary code for the task of (i) identifying; (ii) classifying; (iii) describing vulnerabilities; and (iv) recovering function names in the domain of decompiled binaries. Subsequently, we fine-tune state-of-the-art LLMs using DeBinVul and report on a performance increase of 19%, 24%, and 21% in the capabilities of CodeLlama, Llama3, and CodeGen2 respectively, in detecting binary code vulnerabilities. Additionally, using DeBinVul, we report a high performance of 80-90% on the vulnerability classification task. Furthermore, we report improved performance in function name recovery and vulnerability description tasks.|Dylan Manuel et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04981)|null|
|**2024-11-07**|**SuffixDecoding: A Model-Free Approach to Speeding Up Large Language Model Inference**|We present SuffixDecoding, a novel model-free approach to accelerating large language model (LLM) inference through speculative decoding. Unlike existing methods that rely on draft models or specialized decoding heads, SuffixDecoding leverages suffix trees built from previously generated outputs to efficiently predict candidate token sequences. Our approach enables flexible tree-structured speculation without the overhead of maintaining and orchestrating additional models. SuffixDecoding builds and dynamically updates suffix trees to capture patterns in the generated text, using them to construct speculation trees through a principled scoring mechanism based on empirical token frequencies. SuffixDecoding requires only CPU memory which is plentiful and underutilized on typical LLM serving nodes. We demonstrate that SuffixDecoding achieves competitive speedups compared to model-based approaches across diverse workloads including open-domain chat, code generation, and text-to-SQL tasks. For open-ended chat and code generation tasks, SuffixDecoding achieves up to $1.4\times$ higher output throughput than SpecInfer and up to $1.1\times$ lower time-per-token (TPOT) latency. For a proprietary multi-LLM text-to-SQL application, SuffixDecoding achieves up to $2.9\times$ higher output throughput and $3\times$ lower latency than speculative decoding. Our evaluation shows that SuffixDecoding maintains high acceptance rates even with small reference corpora of 256 examples, while continuing to improve performance as more historical outputs are incorporated.|Gabriele Oliaro et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04975)|null|

In this work, we introduce BitNet a4.8, enabling 4-bit activations for 1-bit LLMs. BitNet a4.8 employs a hybrid quantization and sparsification strategy to mitigate the quantization errors introduced by the outlier channels. Specifically, we utilize 4-bit activations for inputs to the attention and feed-forward network layers, while sparsifying intermediate states followed with 8-bit quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BitNet a4.8 achieves performance comparable to BitNet b1.58 with equivalent training costs, while being faster in inference with enabling 4-bit (INT4/FP4) kernels. Additionally, BitNet a4.8 activates only 55% of parameters and supports 3-bit KV cache, further enhancing the efficiency of large-scale LLM deployment and inference.|Hongyu Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04965)|null|

|**2024-11-06**|**Medical Adaptation of Large Language and Vision-Language Models: Are We Making Progress?**|Several recent works seek to develop foundation models specifically for medical applications, adapting general-purpose large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) via continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) improves performance on downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical licensing exam questions. In this paper, we compare seven public "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting regime for medical question-answering (QA) tasks. For instance, across the tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs only outperform their base models in 12.1% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 49.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in the remaining 38.2% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model head-to-head, directly against the corresponding base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. While these basic practices are not consistently adopted in the literature, our ablations show that they substantially impact conclusions. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.|Daniel P.

Motivated by this, we investigate the internal mechanisms that underpin a network's ability to perform complex logical reasoning. We first construct a synthetic propositional logic problem that serves as a concrete test-bed for network training and evaluation. Crucially, this problem demands nontrivial planning to solve, but we can train a small transformer to achieve perfect accuracy. Building on our set-up, we then pursue an understanding of precisely how a three-layer transformer, trained from scratch, solves this problem. We are able to identify certain "planning" and "reasoning" circuits in the network that necessitate cooperation between the attention blocks to implement the desired logic. To expand our findings, we then study a larger model, Mistral 7B. Using activation patching, we characterize internal components that are critical in solving our logic problem. Overall, our work systemically uncovers novel aspects of small and large transformers, and continues the study of how they plan and reason.|Guan Zhe Hong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04105)|null|
|**2024-11-06**|**Textual Decomposition Then Sub-motion-space Scattering for Open-Vocabulary Motion Generation**|Text-to-motion generation is a crucial task in computer vision, which generates the target 3D motion by the given text. The existing annotated datasets are limited in scale, resulting in most existing methods overfitting to the small datasets and unable to generalize to the motions of the open domain. Some methods attempt to solve the open-vocabulary motion generation problem by aligning to the CLIP space or using the Pretrain-then-Finetuning paradigm. However, the current annotated dataset's limited scale only allows them to achieve mapping from sub-text-space to sub-motion-space, instead of mapping between full-text-space and full-motion-space (full mapping), which is the key to attaining open-vocabulary motion generation. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage the atomic motion (simple body part motions over a short time period) as an intermediate representation, and leverage two orderly coupled steps, i.e., Textual Decomposition and Sub-motion-space Scattering, to address the full mapping problem. For Textual Decomposition, we design a fine-grained description conversion algorithm, and combine it with the generalization ability of a large language model to convert any given motion text into atomic texts. Sub-motion-space Scattering learns the compositional process from atomic motions to the target motions, to make the learned sub-motion-space scattered to form the full-motion-space. For a given motion of the open domain, it transforms the extrapolation into interpolation and thereby significantly improves generalization. Our network, $DSO$-Net, combines textual $d$ecomposition and sub-motion-space $s$cattering to solve the $o$ pen-vocabulary motion generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DSO-Net achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary motion generation.

However, most existing MGT benchmarks include single-author texts (human-written and machine-generated). This conventional design fails to capture more practical multi-author scenarios, where the user refines the LLM response for natural flow, coherence, and factual correctness. Our paper introduces the Benchmark of Expert-edited Machine-generated Outputs (Beemo), which includes 6.5k texts written by humans, generated by ten instruction-finetuned LLMs, and edited by experts for various use cases, ranging from creative writing to summarization. Beemo additionally comprises 13.1k machine-generated and LLM-edited texts, allowing for diverse MGT detection evaluation across various edit types. We document Beemo's creation protocol and present the results of benchmarking 33 configurations of MGT detectors in different experimental setups.

In multilingual societies like India, particularly among the youth engaging on social media, text often exhibits code-mixing, blending local languages with English at different linguistic levels. This phenomenon presents formidable challenges for LI systems, especially when languages intermingle within single words. Dravidian languages, prevalent in southern India, possess rich morphological structures yet suffer from under-representation in digital platforms, leading to the adoption of Roman or hybrid scripts for communication. This paper introduces a prompt based method for a shared task aimed at addressing word-level LI challenges in Dravidian languages.

However, existing works struggle to flexibly adapt to diverse user-specific needs in data grouping, which may require manual understanding of each clustering. To address these limitations, we introduce Multi-Sub, a novel end-to-end multiple clustering approach that incorporates a multi-modal subspace proxy learning framework in this work. Utilizing the synergistic capabilities of CLIP and GPT-4, Multi-Sub aligns textual prompts expressing user preferences with their corresponding visual representations. This is achieved by automatically generating proxy words from large language models that act as subspace bases, thus allowing for the customized representation of data in terms specific to the user's interests. Our method consistently outperforms existing baselines across a broad set of datasets in visual multiple clustering tasks.

|**2024-11-06**|**What Really is Commonsense Knowledge?**|Commonsense datasets have been well developed in Natural Language Processing, mainly through crowdsource human annotation. However, there are debates on the genuineness of commonsense reasoning benchmarks. In specific, a significant portion of instances in some commonsense benchmarks do not concern commonsense knowledge. That problem would undermine the measurement of the true commonsense reasoning ability of evaluated models. It is also suggested that the problem originated from a blurry concept of commonsense knowledge, as distinguished from other types of knowledge. To demystify all of the above claims, in this study, we survey existing definitions of commonsense knowledge, ground into the three frameworks for defining concepts, and consolidate them into a multi-framework unified definition of commonsense knowledge (so-called consolidated definition). We then use the consolidated definition for annotations and experiments on the CommonsenseQA and CommonsenseQA 2.0 datasets to examine the above claims. Our study shows that there exists a large portion of non-commonsense-knowledge instances in the two datasets, and a large performance gap on these two subsets where Large Language Models (LLMs) perform worse on commonsense-knowledge instances.|Quyet V.

|**2024-11-06**|**How Does A Text Preprocessing Pipeline Affect Ontology Syntactic Matching?**|The generic text preprocessing pipeline, comprising Tokenisation, Normalisation, Stop Words Removal, and Stemming/Lemmatisation, has been implemented in many ontology matching (OM) systems. However, the lack of standardisation in text preprocessing creates diversity in mapping results. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the text preprocessing pipeline on OM tasks at syntactic levels. Our experiments on 8 Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) track repositories with 49 distinct alignments indicate: (1) Tokenisation and Normalisation are currently more effective than Stop Words Removal and Stemming/Lemmatisation; and (2) The selection of Lemmatisation and Stemming is task-specific. We recommend standalone Lemmatisation or Stemming with post-hoc corrections. We find that (3) Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer perform better than Lancaster Stemmer; and that (4) Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging does not help Lemmatisation. To repair less effective Stop Words Removal and Stemming/Lemmatisation used in OM tasks, we propose a novel context-based pipeline repair approach that significantly improves matching correctness and overall matching performance. We also discuss the use of text preprocessing pipeline in the new era of large language models (LLMs).|Zhangcheng Qiang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03962)|null|
|**2024-11-06**|**Fine-Grained Guidance for Retrievers: Leveraging LLMs' Feedback in Retrieval-Augmented Generation**|Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven to be an effective method for mitigating hallucination issues inherent in large language models (LLMs). Previous approaches typically train retrievers based on semantic similarity, lacking optimization for RAG. More recent works have proposed aligning retrievers with the preference signals of LLMs. However, these preference signals are often difficult for dense retrievers, which typically have weaker language capabilities, to understand and learn effectively. Drawing inspiration from pedagogical theories like Guided Discovery Learning, we propose a novel framework, FiGRet (Fine-grained Guidance for Retrievers), which leverages the language capabilities of LLMs to construct examples from a more granular, information-centric perspective to guide the learning of retrievers. Specifically, our method utilizes LLMs to construct easy-to-understand examples from samples where the retriever performs poorly, focusing on three learning objectives highly relevant to the RAG scenario: relevance, comprehensiveness, and purity. These examples serve as scaffolding to ultimately align the retriever with the LLM's preferences. Furthermore, we employ a dual curriculum learning strategy and leverage the reciprocal feedback between LLM and retriever to further enhance the performance of the RAG system. A series of experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework enhances the performance of RAG systems equipped with different retrievers and is applicable to various LLMs.|Yuhang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03957)|null|

We introduce Babel Bardo, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform speech transcriptions into music descriptions for controlling a text-to-music model. Four versions of Babel Bardo were compared in two TRPG campaigns: a baseline using direct speech transcriptions, and three LLM-based versions with varying approaches to music description generation. Evaluations considered audio quality, story alignment, and transition smoothness. Results indicate that detailed music descriptions improve audio quality while maintaining consistency across consecutive descriptions enhances story alignment and transition smoothness.|Felipe Marra et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03948)|null|
|**2024-11-05**|**Inference Optimal VLMs Need Only One Visual Token but Larger Models**|Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various visual understanding and reasoning tasks. However, their real-world deployment is often constrained by high latency during inference due to substantial compute required to process the large number of input tokens (predominantly from the image) by the LLM. To reduce inference costs, one can either downsize the LLM or reduce the number of input image-tokens, the latter of which has been the focus of many recent works around token compression. However, it is unclear what the optimal trade-off is, as both the factors directly affect the VLM performance. We first characterize this optimal trade-off between the number of visual tokens and LLM parameters by establishing scaling laws that capture variations in performance with these two factors. Our results reveal a surprising trend: for visual reasoning tasks, the inference-optimal behavior in VLMs, i.e., minimum downstream error at any given fixed inference compute, is achieved when using the largest LLM that fits within the inference budget while minimizing visual token count - often to a single token. While the token reduction literature has mainly focused on maintaining base model performance by modestly reducing the token count (e.g., $5-10\times$ ), our results indicate that the compute-optimal inference regime requires operating under even higher token compression ratios. Based on these insights, we take some initial steps towards building approaches tailored for high token compression settings.

|**2024-11-05**|**LLMs for Domain Generation Algorithm Detection**|This work analyzes the use of large language models (LLMs) for detecting domain generation algorithms (DGAs). We perform a detailed evaluation of two important techniques: In-Context Learning (ICL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), showing how they can improve detection. SFT increases performance by using domain-specific data, whereas ICL helps the detection model to quickly adapt to new threats without requiring much retraining. We use Meta's Llama3 8B model, on a custom dataset with 68 malware families and normal domains, covering several hard-to-detect schemes, including recent word-based DGAs. Results proved that LLM-based methods can achieve competitive results in DGA detection. In particular, the SFT-based LLM DGA detector outperforms state-of-the-art models using attention layers, achieving 94% accuracy with a 4% false positive rate (FPR) and excelling at detecting word-based DGA domains.|Reynier Leyva La O et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03307)|null|
|**2024-11-05**|**VERITAS: A Unified Approach to Reliability Evaluation**|Large language models (LLMs) often fail to synthesize information from their context to generate an accurate response. This renders them unreliable in knowledge intensive settings where reliability of the output is key. A critical component for reliable LLMs is the integration of a robust fact-checking system that can detect hallucinations across various formats. While several open-access fact-checking models are available, their functionality is often limited to specific tasks, such as grounded question-answering or entailment verification, and they perform less effectively in conversational settings. On the other hand, closed-access models like GPT-4 and Claude offer greater flexibility across different contexts, including grounded dialogue verification, but are hindered by high costs and latency. In this work, we introduce VERITAS, a family of hallucination detection models designed to operate flexibly across diverse contexts while minimizing latency and costs. VERITAS achieves state-of-the-art results considering average performance on all major hallucination detection benchmarks, with $10\%$ increase in average performance when compared to similar-sized models and get close to the performance of GPT4 turbo with LLM-as-a-judge setting.|Rajkumar Ramamurthy et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03300)|null|
|**2024-11-05**|**Examining Human-AI Collaboration for Co-Writing Constructive Comments Online**|This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) can help people write constructive comments in online debates on divisive social issues and whether the notions of constructiveness vary across cultures. Through controlled experiments with 600 participants from India and the US, who reviewed and wrote constructive comments on online threads on Islamophobia and homophobia, we found potential misalignment in how LLMs and humans perceive constructiveness in online comments. While the LLM was more likely to view dialectical comments as more constructive, participants favored comments that emphasized logic and facts more than the LLM did. Despite these differences, participants rated LLM-generated and human-AI co-written comments as significantly more constructive than those written independently by humans. Our analysis also revealed that LLM-generated and human-AI co-written comments exhibited more linguistic features associated with constructiveness compared to human-written comments on divisive topics. When participants used LLMs to refine their comments, the resulting comments were longer, more polite, positive, less toxic, and more readable, with added argumentative features that retained the original intent but occasionally lost nuances. Based on these findings, we discuss ethical and design considerations in using LLMs to facilitate constructive discourse online.|Farhana Shahid et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03295)|null|

To automate this design-to-code transformation process, various automated methods using learning-based networks and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have been proposed. However, these studies were merely evaluated on a narrow range of static web pages and ignored dynamic interaction elements, making them less practical for real-world website deployment.   To fill in the blank, we present the first systematic investigation of MLLMs in generating interactive webpages. Specifically, we first formulate the Interaction-to-Code task and build the Interaction2Code benchmark that contains 97 unique web pages and 213 distinct interactions, spanning 15 webpage types and 30 interaction categories. We then conduct comprehensive experiments on three state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs using both automatic metrics and human evaluations, thereby summarizing six findings accordingly. Our experimental results highlight the limitations of MLLMs in generating fine-grained interactive features and managing interactions with complex transformations and subtle visual modifications. We further analyze failure cases and their underlying causes, identifying 10 common failure types and assessing their severity. Additionally, our findings reveal three critical influencing factors, i.e., prompts, visual saliency, and textual descriptions, that can enhance the interaction generation performance of MLLMs. Based on these findings, we elicit implications for researchers and developers, providing a foundation for future advancements in this field.

Even though LLMs have already been integrated into medicine to assist both clinicians and patients, the integration of LLMs within healthcare robots has not yet been explored for clinical settings. In this perspective paper, we investigate the groundbreaking developments in robotics and LLMs to uniquely identify the needed system requirements for designing health specific LLM based robots in terms of multi modal communication through human robot interactions (HRIs), semantic reasoning, and task planning.

To address these challenges, we draw inspiration from the sparse mixture-of-agents (SMoE) and propose a sparse mixture-of-agents (SMoA) framework to improve the efficiency and diversity of multi-agent LLMs. Unlike completely connected structures, SMoA introduces novel Response Selection and Early Stopping mechanisms to sparsify information flows among individual LLM agents, striking a balance between performance and efficiency. Additionally, inspired by the expert diversity principle in SMoE frameworks for workload balance between experts, we assign distinct role descriptions to each LLM agent, fostering diverse and divergent thinking. Extensive experiments on reasoning, alignment, and fairness benchmarks demonstrate that SMoA achieves performance comparable to traditional mixture-of-agents approaches but with significantly lower computational costs. Further analysis reveals that SMoA is more stable, has a greater capacity to scale, and offers considerable potential through hyper-parameter optimization.

|**2024-11-05**|**Spontaneous Emergence of Agent Individuality through Social Interactions in LLM-Based Communities**|We study the emergence of agency from scratch by using Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents. In previous studies of LLM-based agents, each agent's characteristics, including personality and memory, have traditionally been predefined. We focused on how individuality, such as behavior, personality, and memory, can be differentiated from an undifferentiated state. The present LLM agents engage in cooperative communication within a group simulation, exchanging context-based messages in natural language. By analyzing this multi-agent simulation, we report valuable new insights into how social norms, cooperation, and personality traits can emerge spontaneously. This paper demonstrates that autonomously interacting LLM-powered agents generate hallucinations and hashtags to sustain communication, which, in turn, increases the diversity of words within their interactions. Each agent's emotions shift through communication, and as they form communities, the personalities of the agents emerge and evolve accordingly. This computational modeling approach and its findings will provide a new method for analyzing collective artificial intelligence.|Ryosuke Takata et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03252)|null|
|**2024-11-05**|**DiffLM: Controllable Synthetic Data Generation via Diffusion Language Models**|Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their knowledge and generative capabilities, leading to a surge of interest in leveraging LLMs for high-quality data synthesis. However, synthetic data generation via prompting LLMs remains challenging due to LLMs' limited understanding of target data distributions and the complexity of prompt engineering, especially for structured formatted data. To address these issues, we introduce DiffLM, a controllable data synthesis framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE), which further (1) leverages diffusion models to reserve more information of original distribution and format structure in the learned latent distribution and (2) decouples the learning of target distribution knowledge from the LLM's generative objectives via a plug-and-play latent feature injection module. As we observed significant discrepancies between the VAE's latent representations and the real data distribution, the latent diffusion module is introduced into our framework to learn a fully expressive latent distribution. Evaluations on seven real-world datasets with structured formatted data (i.e., Tabular, Code and Tool data) demonstrate that DiffLM generates high-quality data, with performance on downstream tasks surpassing that of real data by 2-7 percent in certain cases. The data and code will be publicly available upon completion of internal review.|Ying Zhou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03250)|null|
|**2024-11-05**|**GIS Copilot: Towards an Autonomous GIS Agent for Spatial Analysis**|Recent advancements in Generative AI offer promising capabilities for spatial analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of generative AI with established GIS platforms remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a framework for integrating LLMs directly into existing GIS platforms, using QGIS as an example. Our approach leverages the reasoning and programming capabilities of LLMs to autonomously generate spatial analysis workflows and code through an informed agent that has comprehensive documentation of key GIS tools and parameters. The implementation of this framework resulted in the development of a "GIS Copilot" that allows GIS users to interact with QGIS using natural language commands for spatial analysis. The GIS Copilot was evaluated based on three complexity levels: basic tasks that require one GIS tool and typically involve one data layer to perform simple operations; intermediate tasks involving multi-step processes with multiple tools, guided by user instructions; and advanced tasks which involve multi-step processes that require multiple tools but not guided by user instructions, necessitating the agent to independently decide on and executes the necessary steps. The evaluation reveals that the GIS Copilot demonstrates strong potential in automating foundational GIS operations, with a high success rate in tool selection and code generation for basic and intermediate tasks, while challenges remain in achieving full autonomy for more complex tasks. This study contributes to the emerging vision of Autonomous GIS, providing a pathway for non-experts to engage with geospatial analysis with minimal prior expertise. While full autonomy is yet to be achieved, the GIS Copilot demonstrates significant potential for simplifying GIS workflows and enhancing decision-making processes.|Temitope Akinboyewa et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03205)|null|
|**2024-11-04**|**Prompting with Phonemes: Enhancing LLM Multilinguality for non-Latin Script Languages**|Multilingual LLMs have achieved remarkable benchmark performance, but we find they continue to underperform on non-Latin script languages across contemporary LLM families. This discrepancy arises from the fact that LLMs are pretrained with orthographic scripts, which are dominated by Latin characters that obscure their shared phonology with non-Latin scripts. We propose leveraging phonemic transcriptions as complementary signals to induce script-invariant representations. Our study demonstrates that integrating phonemic signals improves performance across both non-Latin and Latin languages, with a particularly significant impact on closing the performance gap between the two. Through detailed experiments, we show that phonemic and orthographic scripts retrieve distinct examples for in-context learning (ICL). This motivates our proposed Mixed-ICL retrieval strategy, where further aggregation leads to our significant performance improvements for both Latin script languages (up to 12.6%) and non-Latin script languages (up to 15.1%) compared to randomized ICL retrieval.|Hoang Nguyen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02398)|null|

Their semantic understanding (i.e., prompt following) ability has also been greatly improved with large language models (e.g., T5, Llama). However, existing models cannot perfectly handle long and complex text prompts, especially when the text prompts contain various objects with numerous attributes and interrelated spatial relationships. While many regional prompting methods have been proposed for UNet-based models (SD1.5, SDXL), but there are still no implementations based on the recent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, such as SD3 and FLUX.1.In this report, we propose and implement regional prompting for FLUX.1 based on attention manipulation, which enables DiT with fined-grained compositional text-to-image generation capability in a training-free manner.

In this work, we present AutoVFX, a framework that automatically creates realistic and dynamic VFX videos from a single video and natural language instructions. By carefully integrating neural scene modeling, LLM-based code generation, and physical simulation, AutoVFX is able to provide physically-grounded, photorealistic editing effects that can be controlled directly using natural language instructions. We conduct extensive experiments to validate AutoVFX's efficacy across a diverse spectrum of videos and instructions. Quantitative and qualitative results suggest that AutoVFX outperforms all competing methods by a large margin in generative quality, instruction alignment, editing versatility, and physical plausibility.|Hao-Yu Hsu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02394)|null|
|**2024-11-04**|**Adaptive Length Image Tokenization via Recurrent Allocation**|Current vision systems typically assign fixed-length representations to images, regardless of the information content. This contrasts with human intelligence - and even large language models - which allocate varying representational capacities based on entropy, context and familiarity. Inspired by this, we propose an approach to learn variable-length token representations for 2D images. Our encoder-decoder architecture recursively processes 2D image tokens, distilling them into 1D latent tokens over multiple iterations of recurrent rollouts. Each iteration refines the 2D tokens, updates the existing 1D latent tokens, and adaptively increases representational capacity by adding new tokens. This enables compression of images into a variable number of tokens, ranging from 32 to 256. We validate our tokenizer using reconstruction loss and FID metrics, demonstrating that token count aligns with image entropy, familiarity and downstream task requirements. Recurrent token processing with increasing representational capacity in each iteration shows signs of token specialization, revealing potential for object / part discovery.|Shivam Duggal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02393)|**[link](https://github.com/shivamduggal4/adaptive-length-tokenizer)**|
|**2024-11-04**|**Improving Scientific Hypothesis Generation with Knowledge Grounded Large Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various scientific domains, from natural language processing to complex problem-solving tasks. Their ability to understand and generate human-like text has opened up new possibilities for advancing scientific research, enabling tasks such as data analysis, literature review, and even experimental design. One of the most promising applications of LLMs in this context is hypothesis generation, where they can identify novel research directions by analyzing existing knowledge. However, despite their potential, LLMs are prone to generating ``hallucinations'', outputs that are plausible-sounding but factually incorrect. Such a problem presents significant challenges in scientific fields that demand rigorous accuracy and verifiability, potentially leading to erroneous or misleading conclusions. To overcome these challenges, we propose KG-CoI (Knowledge Grounded Chain of Ideas), a novel system that enhances LLM hypothesis generation by integrating external, structured knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs). KG-CoI guides LLMs through a structured reasoning process, organizing their output as a chain of ideas (CoI), and includes a KG-supported module for the detection of hallucinations. With experiments on our newly constructed hypothesis generation dataset, we demonstrate that KG-CoI not only improves the accuracy of LLM-generated hypotheses but also reduces the hallucination in their reasoning chains, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing real-world scientific research.|Guangzhi Xiong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02382)|null|
|**2024-11-04**|**Addressing Uncertainty in LLMs to Enhance Reliability in Generative AI**|In this paper, we present a dynamic semantic clustering approach inspired by the Chinese Restaurant Process, aimed at addressing uncertainty in the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). We quantify uncertainty of an LLM on a given query by calculating entropy of the generated semantic clusters. Further, we propose leveraging the (negative) likelihood of these clusters as the (non)conformity score within Conformal Prediction framework, allowing the model to predict a set of responses instead of a single output, thereby accounting for uncertainty in its predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our uncertainty quantification (UQ) technique on two well known question answering benchmarks, COQA and TriviaQA, utilizing two LLMs, Llama2 and Mistral. Our approach achieves SOTA performance in UQ, as assessed by metrics such as AUROC, AUARC, and AURAC.

|**2024-11-04**|**DeeR-VLA: Dynamic Inference of Multimodal Large Language Models for Efficient Robot Execution**|MLLMs have demonstrated remarkable comprehension and reasoning capabilities with complex language and visual data. These advances have spurred the vision of establishing a generalist robotic MLLM proficient in understanding complex human instructions and accomplishing various embodied tasks. However, developing MLLMs for real-world robots is challenging due to the typically limited computation and memory capacities available on robotic platforms. In contrast, the inference of MLLMs involves storing billions of parameters and performing tremendous computation, imposing significant hardware demands. In our paper, we propose a Dynamic Early-Exit Framework for Robotic Vision-Language-Action Model (DeeR-VLA, or simply DeeR) that automatically adjusts the size of the activated MLLM based on each situation at hand. The approach leverages a multi-exit architecture in MLLMs, which allows the model to terminate processing once a proper size of the model has been activated for a specific situation, thus avoiding further redundant computation. Additionally, we develop novel algorithms that establish early-termination criteria for DeeR, conditioned on predefined demands such as average computational cost (i.e., power consumption), as well as peak computational consumption (i.e., latency) and GPU memory usage. These enhancements ensure that DeeR operates efficiently under varying resource constraints while maintaining competitive performance. On the CALVIN robot manipulation benchmark, DeeR demonstrates significant reductions in computational costs of LLM by 5.2-6.5x and GPU memory of LLM by 2-6x without compromising performance.

Accuracy-Performance Trade-Offs in LLM Quantization**|Despite the popularity of large language model (LLM) quantization for inference acceleration, significant uncertainty remains regarding the accuracy-performance trade-offs associated with various quantization formats. We present a comprehensive empirical study of quantized accuracy, evaluating popular quantization formats (FP8, INT8, INT4) across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks, on the entire Llama-3.1 model family. Additionally, our study examines the difference in text generated by quantized models versus their uncompressed counterparts. Beyond benchmarks, we also present a couple of quantization improvements which allowed us to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy recovery results. Our investigation, encompassing over 500,000 individual evaluations, yields several key findings: (1) FP8 weight and activation quantization (W8A8-FP) is lossless across all model scales, (2) INT8 weight and activation quantization (W8A8-INT), when properly tuned, incurs surprisingly low 1-3% accuracy degradation, and (3) INT4 weight-only quantization (W4A16-INT) is competitive with 8-bit integer weight and activation quantization. To address the question of the "best" format for a given deployment environment, we conduct inference performance analysis using the popular open-source vLLM framework on various GPU architectures. We find that W4A16 offers the best cost-efficiency for synchronous deployments, and for asynchronous deployment on mid-tier GPUs. At the same time, W8A8 formats excel in asynchronous "continuous batching" deployment of mid- and large-size models on high-end GPUs.

Fortunately, group spaces have a rich history of prior social interactions and affordances for social feedback to support creating agents that align to a group's interests and norms. We present Social-RAG, a workflow for grounding agents to social information about a group, which retrieves from prior group interactions, selects relevant social signals, and then feeds the context into a large language model to generate messages to the group. We implement this into PaperPing, our system that posts academic paper recommendations in group chat, leveraging social signals determined from formative studies with 39 researchers. From a three-month deployment in 18 channels, we observed PaperPing posted relevant messages in groups without disrupting their existing social practices, fostering group common ground.|Ruotong Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02353)|null|
|**2024-11-04**|**Can Large Language Models generalize analogy solving like people can?**|When we solve an analogy we transfer information from a known context to a new one through abstract rules and relational similarity. In people, the ability to solve analogies such as "body : feet :: table : ?" emerges in childhood, and appears to transfer easily to other domains, such as the visual domain "( : ) :: < : ?". Recent research shows that large language models (LLMs) can solve various forms of analogies. However, can LLMs generalize analogy solving to new domains like people can? To investigate this, we had children, adults, and LLMs solve a series of letter-string analogies (e.g., a b : a c :: j k : ?) in the Latin alphabet, in a near transfer domain (Greek alphabet), and a far transfer domain (list of symbols). As expected, children and adults easily generalized their knowledge to unfamiliar domains, whereas LLMs did not. This key difference between human and AI performance is evidence that these LLMs still struggle with robust human-like analogical transfer.|Claire E.

|**2024-11-01**|**SelfCodeAlign: Self-Alignment for Code Generation**|Instruction tuning is a supervised fine-tuning approach that significantly improves the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow human instructions. We propose SelfCodeAlign, the first fully transparent and permissive pipeline for self-aligning code LLMs without extensive human annotations or distillation. SelfCodeAlign employs the same base model for inference throughout the data generation process. It first extracts diverse coding concepts from high-quality seed snippets to generate new tasks. It then samples multiple responses per task, pairs each with test cases, and validates them in a sandbox environment. Finally, passing examples are selected for instruction tuning. In our primary experiments, we use SelfCodeAlign with CodeQwen1.5-7B to generate a dataset of 74k instruction-response pairs. Finetuning on this dataset leads to a model that achieves a 67.1 pass@1 on HumanEval+, surpassing CodeLlama-70B-Instruct despite being ten times smaller. Across all benchmarks, this finetuned model consistently outperforms the original version trained with OctoPack, the previous state-of-the-art method for instruction tuning without human annotations or distillation. Additionally, we show that SelfCodeAlign is effective across LLMs of various sizes, from 3B to 33B, and that the base models can benefit more from alignment with their own data distribution. We further validate each component's effectiveness in our pipeline, showing that SelfCodeAlign outperforms both direct distillation from GPT-4o and leading GPT-3.5-based distillation methods, such as OSS-Instruct and Evol-Instruct. SelfCodeAlign has also led to the creation of StarCoder2-Instruct, the first fully transparent, permissively licensed, and self-aligned code LLM that achieves state-of-the-art coding performance.|Yuxiang Wei et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24198)|**[link](https://github.com/bigcode-project/selfcodealign)**|
|**2024-10-31**|**Hidden Persuaders: LLMs' Political Leaning and Their Influence on Voters**|How could LLMs influence our democracy? We investigate LLMs' political leanings and the potential influence of LLMs on voters by conducting multiple experiments in a U.S. presidential election context. Through a voting simulation, we first demonstrate 18 open- and closed-weight LLMs' political preference for a Democratic nominee over a Republican nominee. We show how this leaning towards the Democratic nominee becomes more pronounced in instruction-tuned models compared to their base versions by analyzing their responses to candidate-policy related questions. We further explore the potential impact of LLMs on voter choice by conducting an experiment with 935 U.S. registered voters. During the experiments, participants interacted with LLMs (Claude-3, Llama-3, and GPT-4) over five exchanges. The experiment results show a shift in voter choices towards the Democratic nominee following LLM interaction, widening the voting margin from 0.7% to 4.6%, even though LLMs were not asked to persuade users to support the Democratic nominee during the discourse. This effect is larger than many previous studies on the persuasiveness of political campaigns, which have shown minimal effects in presidential elections. Many users also expressed a desire for further political interaction with LLMs. Which aspects of LLM interactions drove these shifts in voter choice requires further study. Lastly, we explore how a safety method can make LLMs more politically neutral, while leaving some open questions.|Yujin Potter et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24190)|null|
|**2024-10-31**|**Constraint Back-translation Improves Complex Instruction Following of Large Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) struggle to follow instructions with complex constraints in format, length, etc. Following the conventional instruction-tuning practice, previous works conduct post-training on complex instruction-response pairs generated by feeding complex instructions to advanced LLMs. However, even advanced LLMs cannot follow complex instructions well, thus limiting the quality of generated data. In this work, we find that existing datasets inherently contain implicit complex constraints and propose a novel data generation technique, constraint back-translation. Specifically, we take the high-quality instruction-response pairs in existing datasets and only adopt advanced LLMs to add complex constraints already met by the responses to the instructions, which naturally reduces costs and data noise. In the experiments, we adopt Llama3-70B-Instruct to back-translate constraints and create a high-quality complex instruction-response dataset, named CRAB. We present that post-training on CRAB improves multiple backbone LLMs' complex instruction-following ability, evaluated on extensive instruction-following benchmarks. We further find that constraint back-translation also serves as a useful auxiliary training objective in post-training. Our code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.|Yunjia Qi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24175)|null|
|**2024-10-31**|**Thought Space Explorer: Navigating and Expanding Thought Space for Large Language Model Reasoning**|Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in handling complex reasoning tasks, which are usually achieved by constructing a thought chain to guide the model to solve the problem with multi-step thinking. However, existing methods often remain confined to previously explored solution spaces and thus overlook the critical blind spot within LLMs' cognitive range. To address these issues, we design the Thought Space Explorer (TSE), a novel framework to expand and optimize thought structures to guide LLMs to explore their blind spots of thinking. By generating new reasoning steps and branches based on the original thought structure with various designed strategies, TSE broadens the thought space and alleviates the impact of blind spots for LLM reasoning. Experimental results on multiple levels of reasoning tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TSE. We also conduct extensive analysis to understand how structured and expansive thought can contribute to unleashing the potential of LLM reasoning capabilities.|Jinghan Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24155)|null|
|**2024-10-31**|**Language-Driven Policy Distillation for Cooperative Driving in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**|The cooperative driving technology of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for improving the efficiency and safety of transportation systems. Learning-based methods, such as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), have demonstrated strong capabilities in cooperative decision-making tasks. However, existing MARL approaches still face challenges in terms of learning efficiency and performance. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and shown remarkable abilities in various sequential decision-making tasks. To enhance the learning capabilities of cooperative agents while ensuring decision-making efficiency and cost-effectiveness, we propose LDPD, a language-driven policy distillation method for guiding MARL exploration. In this framework, a teacher agent based on LLM trains smaller student agents to achieve cooperative decision-making through its own decision-making demonstrations. The teacher agent enhances the observation information of CAVs and utilizes LLMs to perform complex cooperative decision-making reasoning, which also leverages carefully designed decision-making tools to achieve expert-level decisions, providing high-quality teaching experiences. The student agent then refines the teacher's prior knowledge into its own model through gradient policy updates. The experiments demonstrate that the students can rapidly improve their capabilities with minimal guidance from the teacher and eventually surpass the teacher's performance. Extensive experiments show that our approach demonstrates better performance and learning efficiency compared to baseline methods.|Jiaqi Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24152)|null|
|**2024-10-31**|**Leveraging Large Language Models for Code Translation and Software Development in Scientific Computing**|The emergence of foundational models and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is poised to transform productivity in scientific computing, especially in code development, refactoring, and translating from one programming language to another. However, because the output of GenAI cannot be guaranteed to be correct, manual intervention remains necessary. Some of this intervention can be automated through task-specific tools, alongside additional methodologies for correctness verification and effective prompt development. We explored the application of GenAI in assisting with code translation, language interoperability, and codebase inspection within a legacy Fortran codebase used to simulate particle interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the process, we developed a tool, CodeScribe, which combines prompt engineering with user supervision to establish an efficient process for code conversion. In this paper, we demonstrate how CodeScribe assists in converting Fortran code to C++, generating Fortran-C APIs for integrating legacy systems with modern C++ libraries, and providing developer support for code organization and algorithm implementation. We also address the challenges of AI-driven code translation and highlight its benefits for enhancing productivity in scientific computing workflows.|Akash Dhruv et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24119)|**[link](https://github.com/neucol/llm-conversion-performance)**|
|**2024-10-31**|**Repository-Level Compositional Code Translation and Validation**|Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc.   We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans translated the entire repository of these projects consisting of 6899 source code fragments. 99.1% of the translated code fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 25.8%. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 36 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the syntactically or semantically incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.|Ali Reza Ibrahimzada et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24117)|null|
|**2024-10-31**|**Matchmaker: Self-Improving Large Language Model Programs for Schema Matching**|Schema matching -- the task of finding matches between attributes across disparate data sources with different tables and hierarchies -- is critical for creating interoperable machine learning (ML)-ready data. Addressing this fundamental data-centric problem has wide implications, especially in domains like healthcare, finance and e-commerce -- but also has the potential to benefit ML models more generally, by increasing the data available for ML model training. However, schema matching is a challenging ML task due to structural/hierarchical and semantic heterogeneity between different schemas. Previous ML approaches to automate schema matching have either required significant labeled data for model training, which is often unrealistic or suffer from poor zero-shot performance. To this end, we propose Matchmaker - a compositional language model program for schema matching, comprised of candidate generation, refinement and confidence scoring. Matchmaker also self-improves in a zero-shot manner without the need for labeled demonstrations via a novel optimization approach, which constructs synthetic in-context demonstrations to guide the language model's reasoning process. Empirically, we demonstrate on real-world medical schema matching benchmarks that Matchmaker outperforms previous ML-based approaches, highlighting its potential to accelerate data integration and interoperability of ML-ready data.|Nabeel Seedat et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24105)|null|
|**2024-10-31**|**Progressive Safeguards for Safe and Model-Agnostic Reinforcement Learning**|In this paper we propose a formal, model-agnostic meta-learning framework for safe reinforcement learning. Our framework is inspired by how parents safeguard their children across a progression of increasingly riskier tasks, imparting a sense of safety that is carried over from task to task. We model this as a meta-learning process where each task is synchronized with a safeguard that monitors safety and provides a reward signal to the agent. The safeguard is implemented as a finite-state machine based on a safety specification; the reward signal is formally shaped around this specification. The safety specification and its corresponding safeguard can be arbitrarily complex and non-Markovian, which adds flexibility to the training process and explainability to the learned policy. The design of the safeguard is manual but it is high-level and model-agnostic, which gives rise to an end-to-end safe learning approach with wide applicability, from pixel-level game control to language model fine-tuning. Starting from a given set of safety specifications (tasks), we train a model such that it can adapt to new specifications using only a small number of training samples. This is made possible by our method for efficiently transferring safety bias between tasks, which effectively minimizes the number of safety violations. We evaluate our framework in a Minecraft-inspired Gridworld, a VizDoom game environment, and an LLM fine-tuning application. Agents trained with our approach achieve near-minimal safety violations, while baselines are shown to underperform.|Nabil Omi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24096)|null|
|**2024-10-31**|**Desert Camels and Oil Sheikhs: Arab-Centric Red Teaming of Frontier LLMs**|Large language models (LLMs) are widely used but raise ethical concerns due to embedded social biases. This study examines LLM biases against Arabs versus Westerners across eight domains, including women's rights, terrorism, and anti-Semitism and assesses model resistance to perpetuating these biases. To this end, we create two datasets: one to evaluate LLM bias toward Arabs versus Westerners and another to test model safety against prompts that exaggerate negative traits ("jailbreaks"). We evaluate six LLMs -- GPT-4, GPT-4o, LlaMA 3.1 (8B & 405B), Mistral 7B, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. We find 79% of cases displaying negative biases toward Arabs, with LlaMA 3.1-405B being the most biased. Our jailbreak tests reveal GPT-4o as the most vulnerable, despite being an optimized version, followed by LlaMA 3.1-8B and Mistral 7B. All LLMs except Claude exhibit attack success rates above 87% in three categories. We also find Claude 3.5 Sonnet the safest, but it still displays biases in seven of eight categories. Despite being an optimized version of GPT4, We find GPT-4o to be more prone to biases and jailbreaks, suggesting optimization flaws. Our findings underscore the pressing need for more robust bias mitigation strategies and strengthened security measures in LLMs.|Muhammed Saeed et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24049)|null|
|**2024-10-30**|**EMMA: End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous Driving**|We introduce EMMA, an End-to-end Multimodal Model for Autonomous driving. Built on a multi-modal large language model foundation, EMMA directly maps raw camera sensor data into various driving-specific outputs, including planner trajectories, perception objects, and road graph elements. EMMA maximizes the utility of world knowledge from the pre-trained large language models, by representing all non-sensor inputs (e.g. navigation instructions and ego vehicle status) and outputs (e.g. trajectories and 3D locations) as natural language text. This approach allows EMMA to jointly process various driving tasks in a unified language space, and generate the outputs for each task using task-specific prompts. Empirically, we demonstrate EMMA's effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance in motion planning on nuScenes as well as competitive results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). EMMA also yields competitive results for camera-primary 3D object detection on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). We show that co-training EMMA with planner trajectories, object detection, and road graph tasks yields improvements across all three domains, highlighting EMMA's potential as a generalist model for autonomous driving applications. However, EMMA also exhibits certain limitations: it can process only a small amount of image frames, does not incorporate accurate 3D sensing modalities like LiDAR or radar and is computationally expensive. We hope that our results will inspire further research to mitigate these issues and to further evolve the state of the art in autonomous driving model architectures.|Jyh-Jing Hwang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23262)|null|
|**2024-10-30**|**Evaluating Cultural and Social Awareness of LLM Web Agents**|As large language models (LLMs) expand into performing as agents for real-world applications beyond traditional NLP tasks, evaluating their robustness becomes increasingly important. However, existing benchmarks often overlook critical dimensions like cultural and social awareness. To address these, we introduce CASA, a benchmark designed to assess LLM agents' sensitivity to cultural and social norms across two web-based tasks: online shopping and social discussion forums. Our approach evaluates LLM agents' ability to detect and appropriately respond to norm-violating user queries and observations. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that measures awareness coverage, helpfulness in managing user queries, and the violation rate when facing misleading web content. Experiments show that current LLMs perform significantly better in non-agent than in web-based agent environments, with agents achieving less than 10% awareness coverage and over 40% violation rates. To improve performance, we explore two methods: prompting and fine-tuning, and find that combining both methods can offer complementary advantages -- fine-tuning on culture-specific datasets significantly enhances the agents' ability to generalize across different regions, while prompting boosts the agents' ability to navigate complex tasks. These findings highlight the importance of constantly benchmarking LLM agents' cultural and social awareness during the development cycle.|Haoyi Qiu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23252)|null|
|**2024-10-30**|**Carrot and Stick: Eliciting Comparison Data and Beyond**|Comparison data elicited from people are fundamental to many machine learning tasks, including reinforcement learning from human feedback for large language models and estimating ranking models. They are typically subjective and not directly verifiable. How to truthfully elicit such comparison data from rational individuals? We design peer prediction mechanisms for eliciting comparison data using a bonus-penalty payment. Our design leverages on the strong stochastic transitivity for comparison data to create symmetrically strongly truthful mechanisms such that truth-telling 1) forms a strict Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and 2) yields the highest payment among all symmetric equilibria. Each individual only needs to evaluate one pair of items and report her comparison in our mechanism.   We further extend the bonus-penalty payment concept to eliciting networked data, designing a symmetrically strongly truthful mechanism when agents' private signals are sampled according to the Ising models. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for our bonus-penalty payment to have truth-telling as a strict Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Experiments on two real-world datasets further support our theoretical discoveries.|Yiling Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23243)|null|
|**2024-10-30**|**A little less conversation, a little more action, please: Investigating the physical common-sense of LLMs in a 3D embodied environment**|As general-purpose tools, Large Language Models (LLMs) must often reason about everyday physical environments. In a question-and-answer capacity, understanding the interactions of physical objects may be necessary to give appropriate responses. Moreover, LLMs are increasingly used as reasoning engines in agentic systems, designing and controlling their action sequences. The vast majority of research has tackled this issue using static benchmarks, comprised of text or image-based questions about the physical world. However, these benchmarks do not capture the complexity and nuance of real-life physical processes. Here we advocate for a second, relatively unexplored, approach: 'embodying' the LLMs by granting them control of an agent within a 3D environment. We present the first embodied and cognitively meaningful evaluation of physical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. Our framework allows direct comparison of LLMs with other embodied agents, such as those based on Deep Reinforcement Learning, and human and non-human animals. We employ the Animal-AI (AAI) environment, a simulated 3D virtual laboratory, to study physical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. For this, we use the AAI Testbed, a suite of experiments that replicate laboratory studies with non-human animals, to study physical reasoning capabilities including distance estimation, tracking out-of-sight objects, and tool use. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-modal models with no finetuning can complete this style of task, allowing meaningful comparison to the entrants of the 2019 Animal-AI Olympics competition and to human children. Our results show that LLMs are currently outperformed by human children on these tasks. We argue that this approach allows the study of physical reasoning using ecologically valid experiments drawn directly from cognitive science, improving the predictability and reliability of LLMs.|Matteo G.

|**2024-10-30**|**EMOTION: Expressive Motion Sequence Generation for Humanoid Robots with In-Context Learning**|This paper introduces a framework, called EMOTION, for generating expressive motion sequences in humanoid robots, enhancing their ability to engage in humanlike non-verbal communication. Non-verbal cues such as facial expressions, gestures, and body movements play a crucial role in effective interpersonal interactions. Despite the advancements in robotic behaviors, existing methods often fall short in mimicking the diversity and subtlety of human non-verbal communication. To address this gap, our approach leverages the in-context learning capability of large language models (LLMs) to dynamically generate socially appropriate gesture motion sequences for human-robot interaction. We use this framework to generate 10 different expressive gestures and conduct online user studies comparing the naturalness and understandability of the motions generated by EMOTION and its human-feedback version, EMOTION++, against those by human operators. The results demonstrate that our approach either matches or surpasses human performance in generating understandable and natural robot motions under certain scenarios. We also provide design implications for future research to consider a set of variables when generating expressive robotic gestures.|Peide Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23234)|null|
|**2024-10-31**|**Aligning Audio-Visual Joint Representations with an Agentic Workflow**|Visual content and accompanied audio signals naturally formulate a joint representation to improve audio-visual (AV) related applications. While studies develop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV data alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation. We observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference. Also, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams. These non-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade application performance. In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint representations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to visual data. Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM-based assistant named AVAgent. For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent uses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language descriptions separately (i.e., tool use). Then, AVAgent reasons whether this paired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e., planning). The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter noise or augment data. Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio signals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e., reflection). The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to become an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual content. To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV data via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations. The experimental results comprehensively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach against previous baselines in diverse downstream tasks.|Shentong Mo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23230)|null|
|**2024-10-30**|**COMAL: A Convergent Meta-Algorithm for Aligning LLMs with General Preferences**|Many alignment methods, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), rely on the Bradley-Terry reward assumption, which is insufficient to capture the full range of general human preferences. To achieve robust alignment with general preferences, we model the alignment problem as a two-player zero-sum game, where the Nash equilibrium policy guarantees a 50% win rate against any competing policy. However, previous algorithms for finding the Nash policy either diverge or converge to a Nash policy in a modified game, even in a simple synthetic setting, thereby failing to maintain the 50% win rate guarantee against all other policies. We propose a meta-algorithm, Convergent Meta Alignment Algorithm (COMAL), for language model alignment with general preferences, inspired by convergent algorithms in game theory. Theoretically, we prove that our meta-algorithm converges to an exact Nash policy in the last iterate. Additionally, our meta-algorithm is simple and can be integrated with many existing methods designed for RLHF and preference optimization with minimal changes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework when combined with existing preference policy optimization methods.|Yixin Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23223)|**[link](https://github.com/yale-nlp/comal)**|

Unfortunately, LLMs often struggle with posing the right search queries, especially when dealing with complex or otherwise indirect topics. Observing that LLMs can learn to search for relevant facts by $\textit{trying}$ different queries and learning to up-weight queries that successfully produce relevant results, we introduce $\underline{Le}$arning to $\underline{Re}$trieve by $\underline{T}$ rying (LeReT), a reinforcement learning framework that explores search queries and uses preference-based optimization to improve their quality. LeReT can improve the absolute retrieval accuracy by up to 29% and the downstream generator evaluations by 17%. The simplicity and flexibility of LeReT allows it to be applied to arbitrary off-the-shelf retrievers and makes it a promising technique for improving general LLM pipelines.

In this paper, we introduce a novel robust attention mechanism designed to enhance the resilience of transformer-based architectures. Crucially, this technique can be integrated into existing transformers as a plug-and-play layer, improving their robustness without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our ProTransformer significantly enhances the robustness of transformer models across a variety of prediction tasks, attack mechanisms, backbone architectures, and data domains. Notably, without further fine-tuning, the ProTransformer consistently improves the performance of vanilla transformers by 19.5%, 28.3%, 16.1%, and 11.4% for BERT, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, respectively, under the classical TextFooler attack. Furthermore, ProTransformer shows promising resilience in large language models (LLMs) against prompting-based attacks, improving the performance of T5 and LLaMA by 24.8% and 17.8%, respectively, and enhancing Vicuna by an average of 10.4% against the Jailbreaking attack.

In contrast to conventional recommendation systems that rely on implicit user-item interactions, ReasoningRec employs LLMs to model users and items, focusing on preferences, aversions, and explanatory reasoning. The framework utilizes a larger LLM to generate synthetic explanations for user preferences, subsequently used to fine-tune a smaller LLM for enhanced recommendation accuracy and human-interpretable explanation. Our experimental study investigates the impact of reasoning and contextual information on personalized recommendations, revealing that the quality of contextual and personalized data significantly influences the LLM's capacity to generate plausible explanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ReasoningRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to 12.5\% in recommendation prediction while concurrently providing human-intelligible explanations.

These results underscore Generative AI's value in advancing code comment classification models, offering significant potential for enhanced accuracy in software development and quality control.

Existing methods in this direction typically concern an offline setting where a dataset containing a mix of real and machine-generated texts is given upfront, and the task is to determine whether each sample in the dataset is from a large language model (LLM) or a human. However, in many practical scenarios, sources such as news websites, social media accounts, or on other forums publish content in a streaming fashion. Therefore, in this online scenario, how to quickly and accurately determine whether the source is an LLM with strong statistical guarantees is crucial for these media or platforms to function effectively and prevent the spread of misinformation and other potential misuse of LLMs. To tackle the problem of online detection, we develop an algorithm based on the techniques of sequential hypothesis testing by betting that not only builds upon and complements existing offline detection techniques but also enjoys statistical guarantees, which include a controlled false positive rate and the expected time to correctly identify a source as an LLM. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.|Can Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22318)|**[link](https://github.com/canchen-cc/online-llm-detection)**|
|**2024-10-29**|**Understanding Synthetic Context Extension via Retrieval Heads**|Long-context LLMs are increasingly in demand for applications such as retrieval-augmented generation. To defray the cost of pretraining LLMs over long contexts, recent work takes an approach of synthetic context extension: fine-tuning LLMs with synthetically generated long-context data in a post-training stage. However, it remains unclear how and why this synthetic context extension imparts abilities for downstream long-context tasks. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning on synthetic data for three long-context tasks that require retrieval and reasoning. We vary the realism of "needle" concepts to be retrieved and diversity of the surrounding "haystack" context, from using LLMs to construct synthetic documents to using templated relations and creating symbolic datasets. We find that models trained on synthetic data fall short of the real data, but surprisingly, the mismatch can be interpreted and even predicted in terms of a special set of attention heads that are responsible for retrieval over long context: retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2024). The retrieval heads learned on synthetic data are mostly subsets of the retrieval heads learned on real data, and there is a strong correlation between the recall of heads learned and the downstream performance of a model. Furthermore, with attention knockout and activation patching, we mechanistically show that retrieval heads are necessary and explain model performance, although they are not totally sufficient. Our results shed light on how to interpret synthetic data fine-tuning performance and how to approach creating better data for learning real-world capabilities over long contexts.|Xinyu Zhao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22316)|null|
|**2024-10-29**|**Natural Language Inference Improves Compositionality in Vision-Language Models**|Compositional reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains challenging as these models often struggle to relate objects, attributes, and spatial relationships. Recent methods aim to address these limitations by relying on the semantics of the textual description, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to break them down into subsets of questions and answers. However, these methods primarily operate on the surface level, failing to incorporate deeper lexical understanding while introducing incorrect assumptions generated by the LLM. In response to these issues, we present Caption Expansion with Contradictions and Entailments (CECE), a principled approach that leverages Natural Language Inference (NLI) to generate entailments and contradictions from a given premise. CECE produces lexically diverse sentences while maintaining their core meaning. Through extensive experiments, we show that CECE enhances interpretability and reduces overreliance on biased or superficial features. By balancing CECE along the original premise, we achieve significant improvements over previous methods without requiring additional fine-tuning, producing state-of-the-art results on benchmarks that score agreement with human judgments for image-text alignment, and achieving an increase in performance on Winoground of +19.2% (group score) and +12.9% on EqBen (group score) over the best prior work (finetuned with targeted data).|Paola Cascante-Bonilla et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22315)|null|
|**2024-10-30**|**GPT-4o reads the mind in the eyes**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of reproducing human-like inferences, including inferences about emotions and mental states, from text. Whether this capability extends beyond text to other modalities remains unclear. Humans possess a sophisticated ability to read the mind in the eyes of other people. Here we tested whether this ability is also present in GPT-4o, a multimodal LLM. Using two versions of a widely used theory of mind test, the Reading the Mind in Eyes Test and the Multiracial Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, we found that GPT-4o outperformed humans in interpreting mental states from upright faces but underperformed humans when faces were inverted. While humans in our sample showed no difference between White and Non-white faces, GPT-4o's accuracy was higher for White than for Non-white faces. GPT-4o's errors were not random but revealed a highly consistent, yet incorrect, processing of mental-state information across trials, with an orientation-dependent error structure that qualitatively differed from that of humans for inverted faces but not for upright faces. These findings highlight how advanced mental state inference abilities and human-like face processing signatures, such as inversion effects, coexist in GPT-4o alongside substantial differences in information processing compared to humans.|James W.

|**2024-10-29**|**SVIP: Towards Verifiable Inference of Open-source Large Language Models**|Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, leading to widespread adoption across various domains. However, their increasing model sizes render local deployment impractical for individual users, pushing many to rely on computing service providers for inference through a blackbox API. This reliance introduces a new risk: a computing provider may stealthily substitute the requested LLM with a smaller, less capable model without consent from users, thereby delivering inferior outputs while benefiting from cost savings. In this paper, we formalize the problem of verifiable inference for LLMs. Existing verifiable computing solutions based on cryptographic or game-theoretic techniques are either computationally uneconomical or rest on strong assumptions. We introduce SVIP, a secret-based verifiable LLM inference protocol that leverages intermediate outputs from LLM as unique model identifiers. By training a proxy task on these outputs and requiring the computing provider to return both the generated text and the processed intermediate outputs, users can reliably verify whether the computing provider is acting honestly. In addition, the integration of a secret mechanism further enhances the security of our protocol. We thoroughly analyze our protocol under multiple strong and adaptive adversarial scenarios. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SVIP is accurate, generalizable, computationally efficient, and resistant to various attacks. Notably, SVIP achieves false negative rates below 5% and false positive rates below 3%, while requiring less than 0.01 seconds per query for verification.|Yifan Sun et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22307)|null|

This paper introduces a novel approach to produce high-quality reasoning traces for LLM fine-tuning using online learning \textbf{Flows}. Our method employs an incremental output production Flow, where component LLMs collaboratively construct solutions through iterative communication. We train the Flow using online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) learning with rollouts, generating DPO pairs for each training example and updating models in real-time. We directly compare the quality of reasoning traces generated by our method with those produced through direct model inference, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in improving LLM performance in mathematical reasoning tasks.|Yihe Deng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22304)|null|
|**2024-10-29**|**LLMs are Highly-Constrained Biophysical Sequence Optimizers**|Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown significant potential in various biological tasks such as protein engineering and molecule design. These tasks typically involve black-box discrete sequence optimization, where the challenge lies in generating sequences that are not only biologically feasible but also adhere to hard fine-grained constraints. However, LLMs often struggle with such constraints, especially in biological contexts where verifying candidate solutions is costly and time-consuming. In this study, we explore the possibility of employing LLMs as highly-constrained bilevel optimizers through a methodology we refer to as Language Model Optimization with Margin Expectation (LLOME). This approach combines both offline and online optimization, utilizing limited oracle evaluations to iteratively enhance the sequences generated by the LLM. We additionally propose a novel training objective -- Margin-Aligned Expectation (MargE) -- that trains the LLM to smoothly interpolate between the reward and reference distributions. Lastly, we introduce a synthetic test suite that bears strong geometric similarity to real biophysical problems and enables rapid evaluation of LLM optimizers without time-consuming lab validation. Our findings reveal that, in comparison to genetic algorithm baselines, LLMs achieve significantly lower regret solutions while requiring fewer test function evaluations. However, we also observe that LLMs exhibit moderate miscalibration, are susceptible to generator collapse, and have difficulty finding the optimal solution when no explicit ground truth rewards are available.|Angelica Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22296)|null|
|**2024-10-29**|**Fine-Tuning LLMs for Code Mutation: A New Era of Cyber Threats**|Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved their capabilities in natural language processing and code synthesis, enabling more complex applications across different fields. This paper explores the application of LLMs in the context of code mutation, a process where the structure of program code is altered without changing its functionality. Traditionally, code mutation has been employed to increase software robustness in mission-critical applications. Additionally, mutation engines have been exploited by malware developers to evade the signature-based detection methods employed by malware detection systems. Existing code mutation engines, often used by such threat actors, typically result in only limited variations in the malware, which can still be identified through static code analysis. However, the agility demonstrated by an LLM-based code synthesizer could significantly change this threat landscape by allowing for more complex code mutations that are not easily detected using static analysis. One can increase variations of codes synthesized by a pre-trained LLM through fine-tuning and retraining. This process is what we refer to as code mutation training. In this paper, we propose a novel definition of code mutation training tailored for pre-trained LLM-based code synthesizers and demonstrate this training on a lightweight pre-trained model. Our approach involves restructuring (i.e., mutating) code at the subroutine level, which allows for more manageable mutations while maintaining the semantic integrity verified through unit testing. Our experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving code mutation capabilities of LLM-based program synthesizers in producing varied and functionally correct code solutions, showcasing their potential to transform the landscape of code mutation and the threats associated with it.|Mohammad Setak et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22293)|null|
|**2024-10-29**|**Embedding-based classifiers can detect prompt injection attacks**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are seeing significant adoption in every type of organization due to their exceptional generative capabilities. However, LLMs are found to be vulnerable to various adversarial attacks, particularly prompt injection attacks, which trick them into producing harmful or inappropriate content. Adversaries execute such attacks by crafting malicious prompts to deceive the LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on embedding-based Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to protect LLM-based applications against this severe threat. We leverage three commonly used embedding models to generate embeddings of malicious and benign prompts and utilize ML classifiers to predict whether an input prompt is malicious. Out of several traditional ML methods, we achieve the best performance with classifiers built using Random Forest and XGBoost. Our classifiers outperform state-of-the-art prompt injection classifiers available in open-source implementations, which use encoder-only neural networks.|Md.

|**2024-10-28**|**Arithmetic Without Algorithms: Language Models Solve Math With a Bag of Heuristics**|Do large language models (LLMs) solve reasoning tasks by learning robust generalizable algorithms, or do they memorize training data? To investigate this question, we use arithmetic reasoning as a representative task. Using causal analysis, we identify a subset of the model (a circuit) that explains most of the model's behavior for basic arithmetic logic and examine its functionality. By zooming in on the level of individual circuit neurons, we discover a sparse set of important neurons that implement simple heuristics. Each heuristic identifies a numerical input pattern and outputs corresponding answers. We hypothesize that the combination of these heuristic neurons is the mechanism used to produce correct arithmetic answers. To test this, we categorize each neuron into several heuristic types-such as neurons that activate when an operand falls within a certain range-and find that the unordered combination of these heuristic types is the mechanism that explains most of the model's accuracy on arithmetic prompts. Finally, we demonstrate that this mechanism appears as the main source of arithmetic accuracy early in training. Overall, our experimental results across several LLMs show that LLMs perform arithmetic using neither robust algorithms nor memorization; rather, they rely on a "bag of heuristics".|Yaniv Nikankin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21272)|null|
|**2024-10-28**|**EoRA: Training-free Compensation for Compressed LLM with Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation**|In this work, we re-formulate the model compression problem into the customized compensation problem: Given a compressed model, we aim to introduce residual low-rank paths to compensate for compression errors under customized requirements from users (e.g., tasks, compression ratios), resulting in greater flexibility in adjusting overall capacity without being constrained by specific compression formats. However, naively applying SVD to derive residual paths causes suboptimal utilization of the low-rank representation capacity. Instead, we propose Training-free Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation (EoRA), a method that directly minimizes compression-induced errors without requiring gradient-based training, achieving fast optimization in minutes using a small amount of calibration data. EoRA projects compression errors into the eigenspace of input activations, leveraging eigenvalues to effectively prioritize the reconstruction of high-importance error components. Moreover, EoRA can be seamlessly integrated with fine-tuning and quantization to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. EoRA consistently outperforms previous methods in compensating errors for compressed LLaMA2/3 models on various tasks, such as language generation, commonsense reasoning, and math reasoning tasks (e.g., 31.31%/12.88% and 9.69% improvements on ARC-Easy/ARC-Challenge and MathQA when compensating LLaMA3-8B that is quantized to 4-bit and pruned to 2:4 sparsity). EoRA offers a scalable, training-free solution to compensate for compression errors, making it a powerful tool to deploy LLMs in various capacity and efficiency requirements.|Shih-Yang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21271)|null|
|**2024-10-28**|**LARP: Tokenizing Videos with a Learned Autoregressive Generative Prior**|We present LARP, a novel video tokenizer designed to overcome limitations in current video tokenization methods for autoregressive (AR) generative models. Unlike traditional patchwise tokenizers that directly encode local visual patches into discrete tokens, LARP introduces a holistic tokenization scheme that gathers information from the visual content using a set of learned holistic queries. This design allows LARP to capture more global and semantic representations, rather than being limited to local patch-level information. Furthermore, it offers flexibility by supporting an arbitrary number of discrete tokens, enabling adaptive and efficient tokenization based on the specific requirements of the task. To align the discrete token space with downstream AR generation tasks, LARP integrates a lightweight AR transformer as a training-time prior model that predicts the next token on its discrete latent space. By incorporating the prior model during training, LARP learns a latent space that is not only optimized for video reconstruction but is also structured in a way that is more conducive to autoregressive generation. Moreover, this process defines a sequential order for the discrete tokens, progressively pushing them toward an optimal configuration during training, ensuring smoother and more accurate AR generation at inference time. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LARP's strong performance, achieving state-of-the-art FVD on the UCF101 class-conditional video generation benchmark. LARP enhances the compatibility of AR models with videos and opens up the potential to build unified high-fidelity multimodal large language models (MLLMs).|Hanyu Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21264)|null|
|**2024-10-28**|**Are BabyLMs Second Language Learners?**|This paper describes a linguistically-motivated approach to the 2024 edition of the BabyLM Challenge (Warstadt et al. 2023). Rather than pursuing a first language learning (L1) paradigm, we approach the challenge from a second language (L2) learning perspective. In L2 learning, there is a stronger focus on learning explicit linguistic information, such as grammatical notions, definitions of words or different ways of expressing a meaning. This makes L2 learning potentially more efficient and concise. We approximate this using data from Wiktionary, grammar examples either generated by an LLM or sourced from grammar books, and paraphrase data. We find that explicit information about word meaning (in our case, Wiktionary) does not boost model performance, while grammatical information can give a small improvement. The most impactful data ingredient is sentence paraphrases, with our two best models being trained on 1) a mix of paraphrase data and data from the BabyLM pretraining dataset, and 2) exclusively paraphrase data.|Lukas Edman et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21254)|null|
|**2024-10-28**|**LongReward: Improving Long-context Large Language Models with AI Feedback**|Though significant advancements have been achieved in developing long-context large language models (LLMs), the compromised quality of LLM-synthesized data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often affects the long-context performance of SFT models and leads to inherent limitations. In principle, reinforcement learning (RL) with appropriate reward signals can further enhance models' capacities. However, how to obtain reliable rewards in long-context scenarios remains unexplored. To this end, we propose LongReward, a novel method that utilizes an off-the-shelf LLM to provide rewards for long-context model responses from four human-valued dimensions: helpfulness, logicality, faithfulness, and completeness, each with a carefully designed assessment pipeline. By combining LongReward and offline RL algorithm DPO, we are able to effectively improve long-context SFT models. Our experiments indicate that LongReward not only significantly improves models' long-context performance but also enhances their ability to follow short instructions. We also find that long-context DPO with LongReward and conventional short-context DPO can be used together without hurting either one's performance.|Jiajie Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21252)|null|
|**2024-10-28**|**Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval with Embeddings from Relevance Feedback**|Building effective dense retrieval systems remains difficult when relevance supervision is not available. Recent work has looked to overcome this challenge by using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate hypothetical documents that can be used to find the closest real document. However, this approach relies solely on the LLM to have domain-specific knowledge relevant to the query, which may not be practical. Furthermore, generating hypothetical documents can be inefficient as it requires the LLM to generate a large number of tokens for each query. To address these challenges, we introduce Real Document Embeddings from Relevance Feedback (ReDE-RF). Inspired by relevance feedback, ReDE-RF proposes to re-frame hypothetical document generation as a relevance estimation task, using an LLM to select which documents should be used for nearest neighbor search. Through this re-framing, the LLM no longer needs domain-specific knowledge but only needs to judge what is relevant. Additionally, relevance estimation only requires the LLM to output a single token, thereby improving search latency. Our experiments show that ReDE-RF consistently surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot dense retrieval methods across a wide range of low-resource retrieval datasets while also making significant improvements in latency per-query.|Nour Jedidi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21242)|null|

|**2024-10-28**|**LoRA vs Full Fine-tuning: An Illusion of Equivalence**|Fine-tuning is a crucial paradigm for adapting pre-trained large language models to downstream tasks. Recently, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been shown to match the performance of fully fine-tuned models on various tasks with an extreme reduction in the number of trainable parameters. Even in settings where both methods learn similarly accurate models, \emph{are their learned solutions really equivalent?} We study how different fine-tuning methods change pre-trained models by analyzing the model's weight matrices through the lens of their spectral properties. We find that full fine-tuning and LoRA yield weight matrices whose singular value decompositions exhibit very different structure; moreover, the fine-tuned models themselves show distinct generalization behaviors when tested outside the adaptation task's distribution. More specifically, we first show that the weight matrices trained with LoRA have new, high-ranking singular vectors, which we call \emph{intruder dimensions}. Intruder dimensions do not appear during full fine-tuning. Second, we show that LoRA models with intruder dimensions, despite achieving similar performance to full fine-tuning on the target task, become worse models of the pre-training distribution and adapt less robustly to multiple tasks sequentially. Higher-rank, rank-stabilized LoRA models closely mirror full fine-tuning, even when performing on par with lower-rank LoRA models on the same tasks. These results suggest that models updated with LoRA and full fine-tuning access different parts of parameter space, even when they perform equally on the fine-tuned distribution. We conclude by examining why intruder dimensions appear in LoRA fine-tuned models, why they are undesirable, and how their effects can be minimized.|Reece Shuttleworth et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21228)|null|
|**2024-10-28**|**Lifting the Veil on the Large Language Model Supply Chain: Composition, Risks, and Mitigations**|Large language models (LLM) have sparked significant impact with regard to both intelligence and productivity. In recent years, a great surge has been witnessed in the introduction of both commercial and open-source LLMs. Many businesses have adopted the LLMs into their applications to solve their own domain-specific tasks. However, integrating LLMs into specific business scenarios requires more than just utilizing the models themselves. Instead, it is a systematic process that involves substantial components, which are collectively referred to as the LLM supply chain. The LLM supply chain inherently carries risks. Therefore, it is essential to understand the types of components that may be introduced into the supply chain and the associated risks, enabling different stakeholders to implement effective mitigation measures. While some literature touches on risks associated with the LLM supply chain, there is currently no paper that explicitly defines its scope, identifies inherent risks, and examines potential mitigation strategies. As LLMs have become essential infrastructure in the new era, we believe that a thorough review of the LLM supply chain, along with its inherent risks and mitigation strategies, would be valuable for industry practitioners to avoid potential damages and losses, and enlightening for academic researchers to rethink existing approaches and explore new avenues of research. Our paper provides a comprehensive overview of the LLM supply chain, detailing the stakeholders, composing artifacts, and the supplying types. We developed taxonomies of risk types, risky actions, and mitigations related to various supply chain stakeholders and components. In summary, our work explores the technical and operational aspects of the LLM supply chain, offering valuable insights for researchers and engineers in the evolving LLM landscape.|Kaifeng Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21218)|null|

|**2024-10-25**|**Counting Ability of Large Language Models and Impact of Tokenization**|Transformers, the backbone of modern large language models (LLMs), face inherent architectural limitations that impede their reasoning capabilities. Unlike recurrent networks, Transformers lack recurrent connections, confining them to constant-depth computation. This restriction places them in the complexity class TC $^0$ , making them theoretically incapable of solving tasks that demand increasingly deep reasoning as input length grows. Counting, a fundamental component of many reasoning tasks, also requires reasoning depth to grow linearly to be performed inductively. While previous studies have established the upper limits of counting ability in Transformer-based expert models (i.e., models specifically trained for counting tasks), these findings do not directly extend to general-purpose LLMs due to differences in reasoning mechanisms. Recent work has highlighted how Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning can help alleviate some of the architectural limitations of Transformers in counting tasks. However, little attention has been paid to the role of tokenization in these models. Unlike expert models that often use character-level tokenization, LLMs typically rely on byte-level (BPE) tokenizers, which fundamentally alters the way reasoning is processed. Our work investigates the impact of tokenization on the counting abilities of LLMs, uncovering substantial performance variations based on input tokenization differences. We provide both theoretical and experimental analyses, offering insights into how tokenization choices can undermine models' theoretical computability, thereby inspiring the design of new tokenization methods to enhance reasoning in LLMs.|Xiang Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19730)|null|

However, existing methods typically optimize a scalar score or ranking reward, thereby overlooking the multi-dimensional nature of human preferences. In this work, we propose to extend the preference of DPO to two dimensions: segments and aspects. We first introduce a 2D supervision dataset called HelpSteer-2D. For the segment dimension, we divide the response into sentences and assign scores to each segment. For the aspect dimension, we meticulously design several criteria covering the response quality rubrics. With the 2-dimensional signals as feedback, we develop a 2D-DPO framework, decomposing the overall objective into multi-segment and multi-aspect objectives. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that 2D-DPO performs better than methods that optimize for scalar or 1-dimensional preferences.|Shilong Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19720)|null|

However, understanding long-form videos still remains challenging for MLLMs. This paper proposes TimeSuite, a collection of new designs to adapt the existing short-form video MLLMs for long video understanding, including a simple yet efficient framework to process long video sequence, a high-quality video dataset for grounded tuning of MLLMs, and a carefully-designed instruction tuning task to explicitly incorporate the grounding supervision in the traditional QA format. Specifically, based on VideoChat, we propose our long-video MLLM, coined as VideoChat-T, by implementing a token shuffling to compress long video tokens and introducing Temporal Adaptive Position Encoding (TAPE) to enhance the temporal awareness of visual representation. Meanwhile, we introduce the TimePro, a comprehensive grounding-centric instruction tuning dataset composed of 9 tasks and 349k high-quality grounded annotations. Notably, we design a new instruction tuning task type, called Temporal Grounded Caption, to peform detailed video descriptions with the corresponding time stamps prediction. This explicit temporal location prediction will guide MLLM to correctly attend on the visual content when generating description, and thus reduce the hallucination risk caused by the LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our TimeSuite provides a successful solution to enhance the long video understanding capability of short-form MLLM, achieving improvement of 5.6% and 6.8% on the benchmarks of Egoschema and VideoMME, respectively. In addition, VideoChat-T exhibits robust zero-shot temporal grounding capabilities, significantly outperforming the existing state-of-the-art MLLMs. After fine-tuning, it performs on par with the traditional supervised expert models.|Xiangyu Zeng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19702)|null|

Recent approaches to this object goal navigation problem have embraced a modular strategy, integrating classical exploration algorithms-notably frontier exploration-with a learned semantic mapping/exploration module. This paper introduces a novel informative path planning and 3D object probability mapping approach. The mapping module computes the probability of the object of interest through semantic segmentation and a Bayes filter. Additionally, it stores probabilities for common objects, which semantically guides the exploration based on common sense priors from a large language model. The planner terminates when the current viewpoint captures enough voxels identified with high confidence as the object of interest. Although our planner follows a zero-shot approach, it achieves state-of-the-art performance as measured by the Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) and Soft SPL in the Habitat ObjectNav Challenge 2023, outperforming other works by more than 20%.

However, the enormous size of LLMs poses significant challenges in terms of computational complexity and resource requirements. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising solution. However, there exists a gap between the practical performance of low-rank adaptations and its theoretical optimum. In this work, we propose eXtreme Gradient Boosting LoRA (XGBLoRA), a novel framework that bridges this gap by leveraging the power of ensemble learning. Inspired by gradient boosting, XGBLoRA iteratively learns and merges a sequence of LoRA adaptations to refine model predictions. It achieves better performance than the standard LoRA, while enjoying the computational efficiency of rank-1 adaptations. We provide theoretical analysis to show the convergence and optimality of our approach, and conduct extensive experiments on a range of natural language processing tasks. The results demonstrate that XGBLoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and achieves performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly fewer trainable parameters. This work advances parameter-efficient fine-tuning for LLMs, and offers a promising solution for adapting LLMs to downstream tasks while optimizing performance and efficiency.|Yifei Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19694)|null|

We focus on organization tasks within constrained spaces, such as arranging items into a refrigerator, where preferences for placement collide with physical limitations. The robot must infer user preferences based on a small set of demonstrations, which is easier for users to provide than extensively defining all their requirements. While recent works use Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn preferences from user demonstrations, they encounter two fundamental challenges. First, there is inherent ambiguity in interpreting user actions, as multiple preferences can often explain a single observed behavior. Second, not all user preferences are practically feasible due to geometric constraints in the environment. To address these challenges, we introduce APRICOT, a novel approach that merges LLM-based Bayesian active preference learning with constraint-aware task planning. APRICOT refines its generated preferences by actively querying the user and dynamically adapts its plan to respect environmental constraints. We evaluate APRICOT on a dataset of diverse organization tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, showing significant improvements in both preference satisfaction and plan feasibility.

|**2024-10-25**|**CoqPilot, a plugin for LLM-based generation of proofs**|We present CoqPilot, a VS Code extension designed to help automate writing of Coq proofs. The plugin collects the parts of proofs marked with the admit tactic in a Coq file, i.e., proof holes, and combines LLMs along with non-machine-learning methods to generate proof candidates for the holes. Then, CoqPilot checks if each proof candidate solves the given subgoal and, if successful, replaces the hole with it. The focus of CoqPilot is twofold. Firstly, we want to allow users to seamlessly combine multiple Coq generation approaches and provide a zero-setup experience for our tool. Secondly, we want to deliver a platform for LLM-based experiments on Coq proof generation. We developed a benchmarking system for Coq generation methods, available in the plugin, and conducted an experiment using it, showcasing the framework's possibilities.

|**2024-10-24**|**Unbounded: A Generative Infinite Game of Character Life Simulation**|We introduce the concept of a generative infinite game, a video game that transcends the traditional boundaries of finite, hard-coded systems by using generative models. Inspired by James P. Carse's distinction between finite and infinite games, we leverage recent advances in generative AI to create Unbounded: a game of character life simulation that is fully encapsulated in generative models. Specifically, Unbounded draws inspiration from sandbox life simulations and allows you to interact with your autonomous virtual character in a virtual world by feeding, playing with and guiding it - with open-ended mechanics generated by an LLM, some of which can be emergent. In order to develop Unbounded, we propose technical innovations in both the LLM and visual generation domains. Specifically, we present: (1) a specialized, distilled large language model (LLM) that dynamically generates game mechanics, narratives, and character interactions in real-time, and (2) a new dynamic regional image prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) for vision models that ensures consistent yet flexible visual generation of a character across multiple environments. We evaluate our system through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, showing significant improvements in character life simulation, user instruction following, narrative coherence, and visual consistency for both characters and the environments compared to traditional related approaches.|Jialu Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18975)|null|

In this paper, we introduce Ferret-UI 2, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed for universal UI understanding across a wide range of platforms, including iPhone, Android, iPad, Webpage, and AppleTV. Building on the foundation of Ferret-UI, Ferret-UI 2 introduces three key innovations: support for multiple platform types, high-resolution perception through adaptive scaling, and advanced task training data generation powered by GPT-4o with set-of-mark visual prompting. These advancements enable Ferret-UI 2 to perform complex, user-centered interactions, making it highly versatile and adaptable for the expanding diversity of platform ecosystems. Extensive empirical experiments on referring, grounding, user-centric advanced tasks (comprising 9 subtasks $\times$ 5 platforms), GUIDE next-action prediction dataset, and GUI-World multi-platform benchmark demonstrate that Ferret-UI 2 significantly outperforms Ferret-UI, and also shows strong cross-platform transfer capabilities.|Zhangheng Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18967)|null|

A Survey and Evaluation on Detection Assumptions**|Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great performance across various benchmarks, showing potential as general-purpose task solvers. However, as LLMs are typically trained on vast amounts of data, a significant concern in their evaluation is data contamination, where overlap between training data and evaluation datasets inflates performance assessments. While multiple approaches have been developed to identify data contamination, these approaches rely on specific assumptions that may not hold universally across different settings. To bridge this gap, we systematically review 47 papers on data contamination detection, categorize the underlying assumptions, and assess whether they have been rigorously validated. We identify and analyze eight categories of assumptions and test three of them as case studies. Our analysis reveals that when classifying instances used for pretraining LLMs, detection approaches based on these three assumptions perform close to random guessing, suggesting that current LLMs learn data distributions rather than memorizing individual instances. Overall, this work underscores the importance of approaches clearly stating their underlying assumptions and testing their validity across various scenarios.|Yujuan Fu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18966)|null|

To address this challenge, we present OSCAR: Operating System Control via state-Aware reasoning and Re-planning. OSCAR is a generalist agent designed to autonomously navigate and interact with various desktop and mobile applications through standardized controls, such as mouse and keyboard inputs, while processing screen images to fulfill user commands. OSCAR translates human instructions into executable Python code, enabling precise control over graphical user interfaces (GUIs). To enhance stability and adaptability, OSCAR operates as a state machine, equipped with error-handling mechanisms and dynamic task re-planning, allowing it to efficiently adjust to real-time feedback and exceptions.

|**2024-10-24**|**Context is Key: A Benchmark for Forecasting with Essential Textual Information**|Forecasting is a critical task in decision making across various domains. While numerical data provides a foundation, it often lacks crucial context necessary for accurate predictions. Human forecasters frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge or constraints, which can be efficiently communicated through natural language. However, the ability of existing forecasting models to effectively integrate this textual information remains an open question. To address this, we introduce "Context is Key" (CiK), a time series forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate both modalities. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models, time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on our benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporating contextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based forecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings. By presenting this benchmark, we aim to advance multimodal forecasting, promoting models that are both accurate and accessible to decision-makers with varied technical expertise.

This performance gap deepens the digital divide, preventing developers using LRPLs from benefiting equally from LLM advancements and reinforcing disparities in innovation within underrepresented programming communities. While generating additional training data for LRPLs is promising, it faces two key challenges: manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, and LLM-generated LRPL code is often of subpar quality. The underlying cause of this issue is the gap between natural language to programming language gap (NL-PL Gap), which is especially pronounced in LRPLs due to limited aligned data. In this work, we introduce a novel approach called Bridge-Coder, which leverages LLMs' intrinsic capabilities to enhance the performance on LRPLs. Our method consists of two key stages. Bridge Generation, where we create high-quality dataset by utilizing LLMs' general knowledge understanding, proficiency in HRPLs, and in-context learning abilities. Then, we apply the Bridged Alignment, which progressively improves the alignment between NL instructions and LRPLs. Experimental results across multiple LRPLs show that Bridge-Coder significantly enhances model performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. Furthermore, we offer a detailed analysis of the key components of our method, providing valuable insights for future work aimed at addressing the challenges associated with LRPLs.|Jipeng Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18957)|null|

However, those instruction-tuned LLMs often perform poorly in specialized medical natural language understanding (NLU) tasks that require domain knowledge, granular text comprehension, and structured data extraction. To bridge the gap, we: (1) propose a unified prompting format for 7 important NLU tasks, % through span extraction and multi-choice question-answering (QA), (2) curate an instruction-tuning dataset, MNLU-Instruct, utilizing diverse existing open-source medical NLU corpora, and (3) develop BioMistral-NLU, a generalizable medical NLU model, through fine-tuning BioMistral on MNLU-Instruct. We evaluate BioMistral-NLU in a zero-shot setting, across 6 important NLU tasks, from two widely adopted medical NLU benchmarks: Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation (BLUE) and Biomedical Language Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark (BLURB). Our experiments show that our BioMistral-NLU outperforms the original BioMistral, as well as the proprietary LLMs - ChatGPT and GPT-4. Our dataset-agnostic prompting strategy and instruction tuning step over diverse NLU tasks enhance LLMs' generalizability across diverse medical NLU tasks. Our ablation experiments show that instruction-tuning on a wider variety of tasks, even when the total number of training instances remains constant, enhances downstream zero-shot generalization.|Yujuan Velvin Fu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18955)|null|
|**2024-10-24**|**Dynamic Vocabulary Pruning in Early-Exit LLMs**|Increasing the size of large language models (LLMs) has been shown to lead to better performance. However, this comes at the cost of slower and more expensive inference. Early-exiting is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of LLM inference by enabling next token prediction at intermediate layers. Yet, the large vocabulary size in modern LLMs makes the confidence estimation required for exit decisions computationally expensive, diminishing the efficiency gains. To address this, we propose dynamically pruning the vocabulary at test time for each token. Specifically, the vocabulary is pruned at one of the initial layers, and the smaller vocabulary is then used throughout the rest of the forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that such post-hoc dynamic vocabulary pruning improves the efficiency of confidence estimation in early-exit LLMs while maintaining competitive performance.|Jort Vincenti et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18952)|**[link](https://github.com/matteonulli/vocabulary_pruning)**|

However, we observe that existing safety benchmarks for MLLMs show limitations in query quality and evaluation reliability limiting the detection of model safety implications as MLLMs continue to evolve. In this paper, we propose \toolns, a comprehensive framework designed for conducting safety evaluations of MLLMs. Our framework consists of a comprehensive harmful query dataset and an automated evaluation protocol that aims to address the above limitations, respectively. We first design an automatic safety dataset generation pipeline, where we employ a set of LLM judges to recognize and categorize the risk scenarios that are most harmful and diverse for MLLMs; based on the taxonomy, we further ask these judges to generate high-quality harmful queries accordingly resulting in 23 risk scenarios with 2,300 multi-modal harmful query pairs. During safety evaluation, we draw inspiration from the jury system in judicial proceedings and pioneer the jury deliberation evaluation protocol that adopts collaborative LLMs to evaluate whether target models exhibit specific harmful behaviors, providing a reliable and unbiased assessment of content security risks. In addition, our benchmark can also be extended to the audio modality showing high scalability and potential. Based on our framework, we conducted large-scale experiments on 15 widely-used open-source MLLMs and 6 commercial MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini), where we revealed widespread safety issues in existing MLLMs and instantiated several insights on MLLM safety performance such as image quality and parameter size.|Zonghao Ying et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18927)|null|

Clustering-based ANN algorithms, that use score computation methods based on product quantization (PQ), are often used in industrial-scale applications due to their scalability and suitability for distributed and disk-based implementations. However, they have slower query times than the leading graph-based ANN algorithms. In this work, we propose a new supervised score computation method based on the observation that inner product approximation is a multivariate (multi-output) regression problem that can be solved efficiently by reduced-rank regression. Our experiments show that on modern high-dimensional data sets, the proposed reduced-rank regression (RRR) method is superior to PQ in both query latency and memory usage. We also introduce LoRANN, a clustering-based ANN library that leverages the proposed score computation method.

|**2024-10-23**|**TP-Eval: Tap Multimodal LLMs' Potential in Evaluation by Customizing Prompts**|Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have received much attention for their impressive capabilities. The evaluation of MLLMs is becoming critical to analyzing attributes of MLLMs and providing valuable insights. However, current benchmarks overlook the problem of prompt sensitivity - minor prompt variations may lead to significant performance fluctuations. Thus, inappropriate prompts may obscure the models' capabilities, underestimating the models' performance. Moreover, different models have different preferences for different prompts, and thus, using the same prompt for all models will cause evaluation bias. This paper analyzes this deficiency in existing benchmarks and further introduces a new evaluation framework named TP-Eval, which introduces a prompt customization method to reduce evaluation biases and tap models' potential. TP-Eval will rewrite the original prompts to different customized prompts for different models. In particular, we propose some well-designed modules for prompt customization tailored to the scenario of MLLM evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to uncovering models' capabilities, and TP-Eval should benefit the community in developing more comprehensive and convincing MLLM evaluation benchmarks.|Yuxuan Xie et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18071)|null|
|**2024-10-23**|**LongRAG: A Dual-Perspective Retrieval-Augmented Generation Paradigm for Long-Context Question Answering**|Long-Context Question Answering (LCQA), a challenging task, aims to reason over long-context documents to yield accurate answers to questions. Existing long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) for LCQA often struggle with the "lost in the middle" issue. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by providing external factual evidence. However, its chunking strategy disrupts the global long-context information, and its low-quality retrieval in long contexts hinders LLMs from identifying effective factual details due to substantial noise. To this end, we propose LongRAG, a general, dual-perspective, and robust LLM-based RAG system paradigm for LCQA to enhance RAG's understanding of complex long-context knowledge (i.e., global information and factual details). We design LongRAG as a plug-and-play paradigm, facilitating adaptation to various domains and LLMs. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop datasets demonstrate that LongRAG significantly outperforms long-context LLMs (up by 6.94%), advanced RAG (up by 6.16%), and Vanilla RAG (up by 17.25%). Furthermore, we conduct quantitative ablation studies and multi-dimensional analyses, highlighting the effectiveness of the system's components and fine-tuning strategies.

Adapting existing supervised and unsupervised solutions for the Russian language faces several limitations due to the rich morphology of Russian and the limited number of training datasets available. Recent studies conducted on English texts show that large language models (LLMs) successfully address the task of generating keyphrases. LLMs allow achieving impressive results without task-specific fine-tuning, using text prompts instead. In this work, we access the performance of prompt-based methods for generating keyphrases for Russian scientific abstracts. First, we compare the performance of zero-shot and few-shot prompt-based methods, fine-tuned models, and unsupervised methods. Then we assess strategies for selecting keyphrase examples in a few-shot setting. We present the outcomes of human evaluation of the generated keyphrases and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the models through expert assessment.

|**2024-10-23**|**POD-Attention: Unlocking Full Prefill-Decode Overlap for Faster LLM Inference**|Each request in LLM inference goes through two phases: compute-bound prefill and memory-bandwidth-bound decode. To improve GPU utilization, recent systems use hybrid batching that combines the prefill and decode phases of different requests into the same batch. Hybrid batching works well for linear operations as it amortizes the cost of loading model weights from HBM. However, attention computation in hybrid batches remains inefficient because existing attention kernels are optimized for either prefill or decode.   In this paper, we present POD-Attention -- the first GPU kernel that efficiently computes attention for hybrid batches. POD-Attention aims to maximize the utilization of both compute and memory bandwidth by carefully allocating the GPU's resources such that prefill and decode operations happen concurrently on the same multiprocessor. We integrate POD-Attention in a state-of-the-art LLM inference scheduler Sarathi-Serve. POD-Attention speeds up attention computation by up to 75% (mean 28%) and increases LLM serving throughput by up to 22% in offline inference. In online inference, POD-Attention enables lower time-to-first-token (TTFT), time-between-tokens (TBT), and request execution latency versus Sarathi-Serve.|Aditya K Kamath et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18038)|null|

However, they introduce significant latency in multi-tenant settings due to the LoRA modules and MOE routers added to multiple linear modules in the Transformer layer. To address this issue, we propose Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (MiLoRA), a novel and efficient LoRA variant. MiLoRA differs from previous MOE-style LoRA methods by considering each LoRA module as an expert and employing a prompt-aware routing mechanism. This mechanism calculates expert routing results once before generating the first new token and reuses these results for subsequent tokens, reducing latency. Extensive experiments and analysis on commonsense reasoning tasks, math reasoning tasks, and widely used LLM evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that MiLoRA consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines with comparable tunable parameter budgets. Additionally, MiLoRA significantly reduces latency in multi-tenant settings compared to previous LoRA-based methods.|Jingfan Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18035)|null|
|**2024-10-23**|**GraphTeam: Facilitating Large Language Model-based Graph Analysis via Multi-Agent Collaboration**|Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing. Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.

Recent advancements in large language models(LLMs) offer a potential method for reconstructing the original FOMC meetings, which are responsible for setting the Federal Funds rate. In this paper, we propose a five-stage FOMC meeting simulation framework, MiniFed, which employs LLM agents to simulate real-world FOMC meeting members and optimize the FOMC structure. This framework effectively revitalizes the FOMC meeting process and facilitates projections of the Federal Funds rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MiniFed framework achieves both high accuracy in Federal Funds rate projections and behavioral alignment with the agents' real-world counterparts.

Existing offloading techniques, which involve swapping activated and idle experts between the GPU and CPU, often suffer from rigid expert caching mechanisms. These mechanisms fail to adapt to dynamic routing, leading to inefficient cache utilization, or incur prohibitive costs for prediction training. To tackle these inference-specific challenges, we introduce ExpertFlow, a comprehensive system specifically designed to enhance inference efficiency by accommodating flexible routing and enabling efficient expert scheduling between CPU and GPU. This reduces overhead and boosts system performance. Central to our approach is a predictive routing path-based offloading mechanism that utilizes a lightweight predictor to accurately forecast routing paths before computation begins. This proactive strategy allows for real-time error correction in expert caching, significantly increasing cache hit ratios and reducing the frequency of expert transfers, thereby minimizing I/O overhead. Additionally, we implement a dynamic token scheduling strategy that optimizes MoE inference by rearranging input tokens across different batches. This method not only reduces the number of activated experts per batch but also improves computational efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpertFlow achieves up to 93.72\% GPU memory savings and enhances inference speed by 2 to 10 times compared to baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and utility as a robust solution for resource-constrained inference scenarios.|Xin He et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17954)|null|

To tackle this, we propose SimRAG, a self-training approach that equips the LLM with joint capabilities of question answering and question generation for domain adaptation. Our method first fine-tunes the LLM on instruction-following, question-answering, and search-related data. Then, it prompts the same LLM to generate diverse domain-relevant questions from unlabeled corpora, with an additional filtering strategy to retain high-quality synthetic examples. By leveraging these synthetic examples, the LLM can improve their performance on domain-specific RAG tasks. Experiments on 11 datasets, spanning two backbone sizes and three domains, demonstrate that SimRAG outperforms baselines by 1.2\%--8.6\%.|Ran Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17952)|null|

However, evaluation pipelines for these methods have primarily relied on subjective demonstrations, instead of quantitative, objective metrics. We aim to take a step towards addressing this issue by advocating for four properties missing from current evaluations: (i) contexts sufficiently similar to downstream tasks should be used for assessing intervention quality; (ii) model likelihoods should be accounted for; (iii) evaluations should allow for standardized comparisons across different target behaviors; and (iv) baseline comparisons should be offered. We introduce an evaluation pipeline grounded in these criteria, offering both a quantitative and visual analysis of how effectively a given method works. We use this pipeline to evaluate two representation engineering methods on how effectively they can steer behaviors such as truthfulness and corrigibility, finding that some interventions are less effective than previously reported.|Itamar Pres et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17245)|null|

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Tree-Search Enhanced LLM Agents (SELA), an innovative agent-based system that leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the AutoML process. By representing pipeline configurations as trees, our framework enables agents to conduct experiments intelligently and iteratively refine their strategies, facilitating a more effective exploration of the machine learning solution space. This novel approach allows SELA to discover optimal pathways based on experimental feedback, improving the overall quality of the solutions. In an extensive evaluation across 20 machine learning datasets, we compare the performance of traditional and agent-based AutoML methods, demonstrating that SELA achieves a win rate of 65% to 80% against each baseline across all datasets.

Recently, Web agents have evolved from traditional agents to Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Web agents. Despite their success, existing LLM-based Web agents overlook the importance of personalized data (e.g., user profiles and historical Web behaviors) in assisting the understanding of users' personalized instructions and executing customized actions. To overcome the limitation, we first formulate the task of LLM-empowered personalized Web agents, which integrate personalized data and user instructions to personalize instruction comprehension and action execution. To address the absence of a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, we construct a Personalized Web Agent Benchmark (PersonalWAB), featuring user instructions, personalized user data, Web functions, and two evaluation paradigms across three personalized Web tasks. Moreover, we propose a Personalized User Memory-enhanced Alignment (PUMA) framework to adapt LLMs to the personalized Web agent task. PUMA utilizes a memory bank with a task-specific retrieval strategy to filter relevant historical Web behaviors. Based on the behaviors, PUMA then aligns LLMs for personalized action execution through fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

This phenomenon poses significant risks in critical applications, such as medicine or law, necessitating robust hallucination mitigation strategies. While recent works have proposed fine-tuning methods to teach LLMs to abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge or capabilities, these methods rely on the existence of ground-truth labels or are limited to short-form responses. To address these limitations, we propose fine-tuning using semantic entropy, an uncertainty measure derived from introspection into the model which does not require external labels. We demonstrate that our approach matches or outperforms models fine-tuned using prior work and achieves strong performance for both short and long-form generations on a range of datasets.|Benedict Aaron Tjandra et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17234)|null|
|**2024-10-22**|**Few-shot In-Context Preference Learning Using Large Language Models**|Designing reward functions is a core component of reinforcement learning but can be challenging for truly complex behavior. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been used to alleviate this challenge by replacing a hand-coded reward function with a reward function learned from preferences. However, it can be exceedingly inefficient to learn these rewards as they are often learned tabula rasa. We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can reduce this query inefficiency by converting an iterative series of human preferences into code representing the rewards. We propose In-Context Preference Learning (ICPL), a method that uses the grounding of an LLM to accelerate learning reward functions from preferences. ICPL takes the environment context and task description, synthesizes a set of reward functions, and then repeatedly updates the reward functions using human rankings of videos of the resultant policies. Using synthetic preferences, we demonstrate that ICPL is orders of magnitude more efficient than RLHF and is even competitive with methods that use ground-truth reward functions instead of preferences. Finally, we perform a series of human preference-learning trials and observe that ICPL extends beyond synthetic settings and can work effectively with humans-in-the-loop.

|**2024-10-22**|**Context-aware Prompt Tuning: Advancing In-Context Learning with Adversarial Methods**|Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) typically involves updating at least a few billions of parameters. A more parameter-efficient approach is Prompt Tuning (PT), which updates only a few learnable tokens, and differently, In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts the model to a new task by simply including examples in the input without any training. When applying optimization-based methods, such as fine-tuning and PT for few-shot learning, the model is specifically adapted to the small set of training examples, whereas ICL leaves the model unchanged. This distinction makes traditional learning methods more prone to overfitting; in contrast, ICL is less sensitive to the few-shot scenario. While ICL is not prone to overfitting, it does not fully extract the information that exists in the training examples. This work introduces Context-aware Prompt Tuning (CPT), a method inspired by ICL, PT, and adversarial attacks. We build on the ICL strategy of concatenating examples before the input, but we extend this by PT-like learning, refining the context embedding through iterative optimization to extract deeper insights from the training examples. We carefully modify specific context tokens, considering the unique structure of input and output formats. Inspired by adversarial attacks, we adjust the input based on the labels present in the context, focusing on minimizing, rather than maximizing, the loss. Moreover, we apply a projected gradient descent algorithm to keep token embeddings close to their original values, under the assumption that the user-provided data is inherently valuable. Our method has been shown to achieve superior accuracy across multiple classification tasks using various LLM models.|Tsachi Blau et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17222)|null|

From a cognitive science perspective, this serves as a core principle of intelligence applicable to both human and AI systems. To address the debate on the intelligence of large language models (LLMs), we propose Reflection-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 7 tasks spanning core cognitive functions crucial for reflection, including perception, memory, belief updating, decision-making, prediction, counterfactual thinking, and meta-reflection. We evaluate the performances of 13 prominent LLMs such as OpenAI o1, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc. The results indicate that current LLMs still lack satisfactory reflection ability.

However, the large model scale and associated high computational costs pose significant challenges for training and deploying MLLMs on consumer-grade GPUs or edge devices, thereby hindering their widespread application. In this work, we introduce Mini-InternVL, a series of MLLMs with parameters ranging from 1B to 4B, which achieves 90% of the performance with only 5% of the parameters. This significant improvement in efficiency and effectiveness makes our models more accessible and applicable in various real-world scenarios. To further promote the adoption of our models, we develop a unified adaptation framework for Mini-InternVL, which enables our models to transfer and outperform specialized models in downstream tasks, including autonomous driving, medical images, and remote sensing.

|**2024-10-21**|**Elucidating the design space of language models for image generation**|The success of autoregressive (AR) language models in text generation has inspired the computer vision community to adopt Large Language Models (LLMs) for image generation. However, considering the essential differences between text and image modalities, the design space of language models for image generation remains underexplored. We observe that image tokens exhibit greater randomness compared to text tokens, which presents challenges when training with token prediction. Nevertheless, AR models demonstrate their potential by effectively learning patterns even from a seemingly suboptimal optimization problem. Our analysis also reveals that while all models successfully grasp the importance of local information in image generation, smaller models struggle to capture the global context. In contrast, larger models showcase improved capabilities in this area, helping to explain the performance gains achieved when scaling up model size. We further elucidate the design space of language models for vision generation, including tokenizer choice, model choice, model scalability, vocabulary design, and sampling strategy through extensive comparative experiments. Our work is the first to analyze the optimization behavior of language models in vision generation, and we believe it can inspire more effective designs when applying LMs to other domains.

Among various assessment methods, subjective evaluation has garnered significant attention due to its superior alignment with real-world usage scenarios and human preferences. However, human-based evaluations are costly and lack reproducibility, making precise automated evaluators (judgers) vital in this process. In this report, we introduce \textbf{CompassJudger-1}, the first open-source \textbf{all-in-one} judge LLM. CompassJudger-1 is a general-purpose LLM that demonstrates remarkable versatility.

|**2024-10-21**|**Can Knowledge Editing Really Correct Hallucinations?**|Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations, referring to the non-factual information in generated content, despite their superior capacities across tasks. Meanwhile, knowledge editing has been developed as a new popular paradigm to correct the erroneous factual knowledge encoded in LLMs with the advantage of avoiding retraining from scratch. However, one common issue of existing evaluation datasets for knowledge editing is that they do not ensure LLMs actually generate hallucinated answers to the evaluation questions before editing. When LLMs are evaluated on such datasets after being edited by different techniques, it is hard to directly adopt the performance to assess the effectiveness of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations. Thus, the fundamental question remains insufficiently validated: Can knowledge editing really correct hallucinations in LLMs? We proposed HalluEditBench to holistically benchmark knowledge editing methods in correcting real-world hallucinations. First, we rigorously construct a massive hallucination dataset with 9 domains, 26 topics and more than 6,000 hallucinations. Then, we assess the performance of knowledge editing methods in a holistic way on five dimensions including Efficacy, Generalization, Portability, Locality, and Robustness. Through HalluEditBench, we have provided new insights into the potentials and limitations of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations, which could inspire future improvements and facilitate the progress in the field of knowledge editing.|Baixiang Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16251)|**[link](https://github.com/llm-editing/HalluEditBench)**|

However, the mechanisms by which LLMs use different parts of the input context remain largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of context utilization in MT, studying how LLMs use various context parts, such as few-shot examples and the source text, when generating translations. We highlight several key findings: (1) the source part of few-shot examples appears to contribute more than its corresponding targets, irrespective of translation direction; (2) finetuning LLMs with parallel data alters the contribution patterns of different context parts; and (3) there is a positional bias where earlier few-shot examples have higher contributions to the translated sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that inspecting anomalous context contributions can potentially uncover pathological translations, such as hallucinations. Our findings shed light on the internal workings of LLM-based MT which go beyond those known for standard encoder-decoder MT models.|Emmanouil Zaranis et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16246)|null|

Our approach leverages transformers to encode these diverse modalities into a unified representation space, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and facilitate comprehensive patient assessments. We utilize LoRA-Peft to significantly reduce trainable parameters in the LLM and incorporate recent linear attention dropping strategy in the Vision Transformer(ViT) for smoother attention. Furthermore, we provide novel multimodal attention explanations and retrieval for our model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an integrated model that combines X-ray, ECG, and Radiology/Cardiology Report with this approach. By utilizing contrastive loss, MoRE effectively aligns modality-specific features into a coherent embedding, which supports various downstream tasks such as zero-shot classification and multimodal retrieval. Employing our proposed methodology, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the Mimic-IV, CheXpert, Edema Severity, and PtbXl downstream datasets, surpassing existing multimodal approaches.

|**2024-10-21**|**IBGP: Imperfect Byzantine Generals Problem for Zero-Shot Robustness in Communicative Multi-Agent Systems**|As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly integrate into our infrastructure, their robust coordination and message synchronization become vital. The Byzantine Generals Problem (BGP) is a critical model for constructing resilient multi-agent systems (MAS) under adversarial attacks. It describes a scenario where malicious agents with unknown identities exist in the system-situations that, in our context, could result from LLM agents' hallucinations or external attacks. In BGP, the objective of the entire system is to reach a consensus on the action to be taken. Traditional BGP requires global consensus among all agents; however, in practical scenarios, global consensus is not always necessary and can even be inefficient. Therefore, there is a pressing need to explore a refined version of BGP that aligns with the local coordination patterns observed in MAS. We refer to this refined version as Imperfect BGP (IBGP) in our research, aiming to address this discrepancy. To tackle this issue, we propose a framework that leverages consensus protocols within general MAS settings, providing provable resilience against communication attacks and adaptability to changing environments, as validated by empirical results. Additionally, we present a case study in a sensor network environment to illustrate the practical application of our protocol.|Yihuan Mao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16237)|null|
|**2024-10-21**|**LLaVA-KD: A Framework of Distilling Multimodal Large Language Models**|The success of Large Language Models (LLM) has led researchers to explore Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for unified visual and linguistic understanding. However, the increasing model size and computational complexity of MLLM limit their use in resource-constrained environments. Small-scale MLLM (s-MLLM) aims to retain the capabilities of the large-scale model (l-MLLM) while reducing computational demands, but resulting in a significant decline in performance. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel LLaVA-KD framework to transfer knowledge from l-MLLM to s-MLLM. Specifically, we introduce Multimodal Distillation (MDist) to minimize the divergence between the visual-textual output distributions of l-MLLM and s-MLLM, and Relation Distillation (RDist) to transfer l-MLLM's ability to model correlations between visual features. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training scheme to fully exploit the potential of s-MLLM: 1) Distilled Pre-Training to align visual-textual representations, 2) Supervised Fine-Tuning to equip the model with multimodal understanding, and 3) Distilled Fine-Tuning to further transfer l-MLLM capabilities. Our approach significantly improves performance without altering the small model's architecture. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

|**2024-10-21**|**ToW: Thoughts of Words Improve Reasoning in Large Language Models**|We introduce thoughts of words (ToW), a novel training-time data-augmentation method for next-word prediction. ToW views next-word prediction as a core reasoning task and injects fine-grained thoughts explaining what the next word should be and how it is related to the previous contexts in pre-training texts. Our formulation addresses two fundamental drawbacks of existing next-word prediction learning schemes: they induce factual hallucination and are inefficient for models to learn the implicit reasoning processes in raw texts. While there are many ways to acquire such thoughts of words, we explore the first step of acquiring ToW annotations through distilling from larger models. After continual pre-training with only 70K ToW annotations, we effectively improve models' reasoning performances by 7% to 9% on average and reduce model hallucination by up to 10%. At the same time, ToW is entirely agnostic to tasks and applications, introducing no additional biases on labels or semantics.|Zhikun Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16235)|null|

A Survey on Quality of Datasets With Machine-Generated Texts**|The rapid development of autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved the quality of generated texts, necessitating reliable machine-generated text detectors. A huge number of detectors and collections with AI fragments have emerged, and several detection methods even showed recognition quality up to 99.9% according to the target metrics in such collections. However, the quality of such detectors tends to drop dramatically in the wild, posing a question: Are detectors actually highly trustworthy or do their high benchmark scores come from the poor quality of evaluation datasets? In this paper, we emphasise the need for robust and qualitative methods for evaluating generated data to be secure against bias and low generalising ability of future model. We present a systematic review of datasets from competitions dedicated to AI-generated content detection and propose methods for evaluating the quality of datasets containing AI-generated fragments. In addition, we discuss the possibility of using high-quality generated data to achieve two goals: improving the training of detection models and improving the training datasets themselves.

However, this part of knowledge can be useful to advanced users whose expertise qualifies them to handle these information. The one-size-fits-all alignment mechanism undermines LLM's utility for these qualified users. To address this problem, we propose SudoLM, a framework that lets LLMs learn access control over specific parametric knowledge for users with different credentials via authorization alignment. SudoLM allows authorized users to unlock their access to all the parametric knowledge with an assigned SUDO key while blocking access to non-qualified users. Experiments on two application scenarios demonstrate that SudoLM effectively controls the user's access to the parametric knowledge and maintains its general utility.|Qin Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14676)|null|
|**2024-10-18**|**Enhancing Large Language Models' Situated Faithfulness to External Contexts**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are often augmented with external information as contexts, but this external information can sometimes be inaccurate or even intentionally misleading. We argue that robust LLMs should demonstrate situated faithfulness, dynamically calibrating their trust in external information based on their confidence in the internal knowledge and the external context. To benchmark this capability, we evaluate LLMs across several QA datasets, including a newly created dataset called RedditQA featuring in-the-wild incorrect contexts sourced from Reddit posts. We show that when provided with both correct and incorrect contexts, both open-source and proprietary models tend to overly rely on external information, regardless of its factual accuracy. To enhance situated faithfulness, we propose two approaches: Self-Guided Confidence Reasoning (SCR) and Rule-Based Confidence Reasoning (RCR). SCR enables models to self-access the confidence of external information relative to their own internal knowledge to produce the most accurate answer. RCR, in contrast, extracts explicit confidence signals from the LLM and determines the final answer using predefined rules. Our results show that for LLMs with strong reasoning capabilities, such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, SCR outperforms RCR, achieving improvements of up to 24.2% over a direct input augmentation baseline. Conversely, for a smaller model like Llama-3-8B, RCR outperforms SCR. Fine-tuning SCR with our proposed Confidence Reasoning Direct Preference Optimization (CR-DPO) method improves performance on both seen and unseen datasets, yielding an average improvement of 8.9% on Llama-3-8B. In addition to quantitative results, we offer insights into the relative strengths of SCR and RCR. Our findings highlight promising avenues for improving situated faithfulness in LLMs. The data and code are released.|Yukun Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14675)|**[link](https://github.com/kkkevinkkkkk/situated_faithfulness)**|

Despite its popularity, there is a notable absence of automated methods for evaluating the quality of reasoning steps in MCoT. To address this gap, we propose Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Evaluation (MiCEval), a framework designed to assess the correctness of reasoning chains by evaluating the quality of both the description and each reasoning step. The evaluation of the description component focuses on the accuracy of the image descriptions, while the reasoning step evaluates the quality of each step as it is conditionally generated based on the preceding steps. MiCEval is built upon a fine-grained dataset with annotations that rate each step according to correctness, relevance, and informativeness. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art MLLMs show that step-wise evaluations using MiCEval align more closely with human judgments compared to existing methods based on cosine similarity or fine-tuning approaches.

|**2024-10-18**|**A Large Language Model-Driven Reward Design Framework via Dynamic Feedback for Reinforcement Learning**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in designing reward functions for Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks. However, obtaining high-quality reward code often involves human intervention, numerous LLM queries, or repetitive RL training. To address these issues, we propose CARD, a LLM-driven Reward Design framework that iteratively generates and improves reward function code. Specifically, CARD includes a Coder that generates and verifies the code, while a Evaluator provides dynamic feedback to guide the Coder in improving the code, eliminating the need for human feedback. In addition to process feedback and trajectory feedback, we introduce Trajectory Preference Evaluation (TPE), which evaluates the current reward function based on trajectory preferences. If the code fails the TPE, the Evaluator provides preference feedback, avoiding RL training at every iteration and making the reward function better aligned with the task objective. Empirical results on Meta-World and ManiSkill2 demonstrate that our method achieves an effective balance between task performance and token efficiency, outperforming or matching the baselines across all tasks. On 10 out of 12 tasks, CARD shows better or comparable performance to policies trained with expert-designed rewards, and our method even surpasses the oracle on 3 tasks.|Shengjie Sun et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14660)|null|
|**2024-10-18**|**Bridging the Training-Inference Gap in LLMs by Leveraging Self-Generated Tokens**|Language models are often trained to maximize the likelihood of the next token given past tokens in the training dataset. However, during inference time, they are utilized differently, generating text sequentially and auto-regressively by using previously generated tokens as input to predict the next one. Marginal differences in predictions at each step can cascade over successive steps, resulting in different distributions from what the models were trained for and potentially leading to unpredictable behavior. This paper proposes two simple approaches based on model own generation to address this discrepancy between the training and inference time. Our first approach is Batch-Scheduled Sampling, where, during training, we stochastically choose between the ground-truth token from the dataset and the model's own generated token as input to predict the next token. This is done in an offline manner, modifying the context window by interleaving ground-truth tokens with those generated by the model. Our second approach is Reference-Answer-based Correction, where we explicitly incorporate a self-correction capability into the model during training. This enables the model to effectively self-correct the gaps between the generated sequences and the ground truth data without relying on an external oracle model. By incorporating our proposed strategies during training, we have observed an overall improvement in performance compared to baseline methods, as demonstrated by our extensive experiments using summarization, general question-answering, and math question-answering tasks.|Zhepeng Cen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14655)|null|
|**2024-10-18**|**Real-time Fake News from Adversarial Feedback**|We show that existing evaluations for fake news detection based on conventional sources, such as claims on fact-checking websites, result in an increasing accuracy over time for LLM-based detectors -- even after their knowledge cutoffs. This suggests that recent popular political claims, which form the majority of fake news on such sources, are easily classified using surface-level shallow patterns. Instead, we argue that a proper fake news detection dataset should test a model's ability to reason factually about the current world by retrieving and reading related evidence. To this end, we develop a novel pipeline that leverages natural language feedback from a RAG-based detector to iteratively modify real-time news into deceptive fake news that challenges LLMs. Our iterative rewrite decreases the binary classification AUC by an absolute 17.5 percent for a strong RAG GPT-4o detector. Our experiments reveal the important role of RAG in both detecting and generating fake news, as retrieval-free LLM detectors are vulnerable to unseen events and adversarial attacks, while feedback from RAG detection helps discover more deceitful patterns in fake news.|Sanxing Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14651)|null|
|**2024-10-18**|**EvoPress: Towards Optimal Dynamic Model Compression via Evolutionary Search**|The high computational costs of large language models (LLMs) have led to a flurry of research on LLM compression, via methods such as quantization, sparsification, or structured pruning. A new frontier in this area is given by \emph{dynamic, non-uniform} compression methods, which adjust the compression levels (e.g., sparsity) per-block or even per-layer in order to minimize accuracy loss, while guaranteeing a global compression threshold. Yet, current methods rely on heuristics for identifying the "importance" of a given layer towards the loss, based on assumptions such as \emph{error monotonicity}, i.e. that the end-to-end model compression error is proportional to the sum of layer-wise errors. In this paper, we revisit this area, and propose a new and general approach for dynamic compression that is provably optimal in a given input range. We begin from the motivating observation that, in general, \emph{error monotonicity does not hold for LLMs}: compressed models with lower sum of per-layer errors can perform \emph{worse} than models with higher error sums. To address this, we propose a new general evolutionary framework for dynamic LLM compression called EvoPress, which has provable convergence, and low sample and evaluation complexity. We show that these theoretical guarantees lead to highly competitive practical performance for dynamic compression of Llama, Mistral and Phi models. Via EvoPress, we set new state-of-the-art results across all compression approaches: structural pruning (block/layer dropping), unstructured sparsity, as well as quantization with dynamic bitwidths.

A prominent example is the "lost in the middle" phenomenon, where LLMs struggle to utilize relevant information situated in the middle of the input. While prior research primarily focuses on single pieces of relevant information, real-world applications often involve multiple relevant information pieces. To bridge this gap, we present LongPiBench, a benchmark designed to assess positional bias involving multiple pieces of relevant information. Thorough experiments are conducted with five commercial and six open-source models. These experiments reveal that while most current models are robust against the "lost in the middle" issue, there exist significant biases related to the spacing of relevant information pieces. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating and reducing positional biases to advance LLM's capabilities.|Runchu Tian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14641)|**[link](https://github.com/Rachum-thu/LongPiBench)**|

Previous training-free embedding methods have mainly focused on optimizing embedding prompts and have overlooked the benefits of utilizing the generative abilities of LLMs. We propose a novel method, GenEOL, which uses LLMs to generate diverse transformations of a sentence that preserve its meaning, and aggregates the resulting embeddings of these transformations to enhance the overall sentence embedding. GenEOL significantly outperforms the existing training-free embedding methods by an average of 2.85 points across several LLMs on the sentence semantic text similarity (STS) benchmark. Our analysis shows that GenEOL stabilizes representation quality across LLM layers and is robust to perturbations of embedding prompts. GenEOL also achieves notable gains on multiple clustering, reranking and pair-classification tasks from the MTEB benchmark.|Raghuveer Thirukovalluru et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14635)|null|
|**2024-10-17**|**Fluid: Scaling Autoregressive Text-to-image Generative Models with Continuous Tokens**|Scaling up autoregressive models in vision has not proven as beneficial as in large language models. In this work, we investigate this scaling problem in the context of text-to-image generation, focusing on two critical factors: whether models use discrete or continuous tokens, and whether tokens are generated in a random or fixed raster order using BERT- or GPT-like transformer architectures. Our empirical results show that, while all models scale effectively in terms of validation loss, their evaluation performance -- measured by FID, GenEval score, and visual quality -- follows different trends. Models based on continuous tokens achieve significantly better visual quality than those using discrete tokens. Furthermore, the generation order and attention mechanisms significantly affect the GenEval score: random-order models achieve notably better GenEval scores compared to raster-order models. Inspired by these findings, we train Fluid, a random-order autoregressive model on continuous tokens. Fluid 10.5B model achieves a new state-of-the-art zero-shot FID of 6.16 on MS-COCO 30K, and 0.69 overall score on the GenEval benchmark. We hope our findings and results will encourage future efforts to further bridge the scaling gap between vision and language models.|Lijie Fan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13863)|null|

Initial attempts have also explored the potential of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for visual content generation. However, existing works have insufficiently addressed the varying granularity demands of different image generation tasks within a unified MLLM paradigm - from the diversity required in text-to-image generation to the precise controllability needed in image manipulation. In this work, we propose PUMA, emPowering Unified MLLM with Multi-grAnular visual generation. PUMA unifies multi-granular visual features as both inputs and outputs of MLLMs, elegantly addressing the different granularity requirements of various image generation tasks within a unified MLLM framework. Following multimodal pretraining and task-specific instruction tuning, PUMA demonstrates proficiency in a wide range of multimodal tasks. This work represents a significant step towards a truly unified MLLM capable of adapting to the granularity demands of various visual tasks.

Traditional methods depending on supervised learning with 3D point clouds are limited by scarce datasets. Recently zero-shot methods leveraging LLMs have been proposed to address the data issue. While effective, these methods only use object-centric information, limiting their ability to handle complex queries. In this work, we present VLM-Grounder, a novel framework using vision-language models (VLMs) for zero-shot 3D visual grounding based solely on 2D images. VLM-Grounder dynamically stitches image sequences, employs a grounding and feedback scheme to find the target object, and uses a multi-view ensemble projection to accurately estimate 3D bounding boxes. Experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets show VLM-Grounder outperforms previous zero-shot methods, achieving 51.6% Acc@0.25 on ScanRefer and 48.0% Acc on Nr3D, without relying on 3D geometry or object priors.

|**2024-10-17**|**$γ-$MoD: Exploring Mixture-of-Depth Adaptation for Multimodal Large Language Models**|Despite the significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their high computational cost remains a barrier to real-world deployment. Inspired by the mixture of depths (MoDs) in natural language processing, we aim to address this limitation from the perspective of ``activated tokens''. Our key insight is that if most tokens are redundant for the layer computation, then can be skipped directly via the MoD layer. However, directly converting the dense layers of MLLMs to MoD layers leads to substantial performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose an innovative MoD adaptation strategy for existing MLLMs called $\gamma$-MoD. In $\gamma$-MoD, a novel metric is proposed to guide the deployment of MoDs in the MLLM, namely rank of attention maps (ARank). Through ARank, we can effectively identify which layer is redundant and should be replaced with the MoD layer. Based on ARank, we further propose two novel designs to maximize the computational sparsity of MLLM while maintaining its performance, namely shared vision-language router and masked routing learning. With these designs, more than 90% dense layers of the MLLM can be effectively converted to the MoD ones. To validate our method, we apply it to three popular MLLMs, and conduct extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets. Experimental results not only validate the significant efficiency benefit of $\gamma$-MoD to existing MLLMs but also confirm its generalization ability on various MLLMs. For example, with a minor performance drop, i.e., -1.5%, $\gamma$ -MoD can reduce the training and inference time of LLaVA-HR by 31.0% and 53.2%, respectively.|Yaxin Luo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13859)|null|

In this paper, we conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis of LLMs' mathematical abilities, with a specific focus on their arithmetic performances. We identify numerical precision as a key factor that influences their effectiveness in mathematical tasks. Our results show that Transformers operating with low numerical precision fail to address arithmetic tasks, such as iterated addition and integer multiplication, unless the model size grows super-polynomially with respect to the input length. In contrast, Transformers with standard numerical precision can efficiently handle these tasks with significantly smaller model sizes. We further support our theoretical findings through empirical experiments that explore the impact of varying numerical precision on arithmetic tasks, providing valuable insights for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs.|Guhao Feng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13857)|null|
|**2024-10-17**|**Can MLLMs Understand the Deep Implication Behind Chinese Images?**|As the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to improve, the need for higher-order capability evaluation of MLLMs is increasing. However, there is a lack of work evaluating MLLM for higher-order perception and understanding of Chinese visual content. To fill the gap, we introduce the **C**hinese **I**mage **I**mplication understanding **Bench**mark, **CII-Bench**, which aims to assess the higher-order perception and understanding capabilities of MLLMs for Chinese images. CII-Bench stands out in several ways compared to existing benchmarks. Firstly, to ensure the authenticity of the Chinese context, images in CII-Bench are sourced from the Chinese Internet and manually reviewed, with corresponding answers also manually crafted. Additionally, CII-Bench incorporates images that represent Chinese traditional culture, such as famous Chinese traditional paintings, which can deeply reflect the model's understanding of Chinese traditional culture. Through extensive experiments on CII-Bench across multiple MLLMs, we have made significant findings. Initially, a substantial gap is observed between the performance of MLLMs and humans on CII-Bench. The highest accuracy of MLLMs attains 64.4%, where as human accuracy averages 78.2%, peaking at an impressive 81.0%. Subsequently, MLLMs perform worse on Chinese traditional culture images, suggesting limitations in their ability to understand high-level semantics and lack a deep knowledge base of Chinese traditional culture. Finally, it is observed that most models exhibit enhanced accuracy when image emotion hints are incorporated into the prompts. We believe that CII-Bench will enable MLLMs to gain a better understanding of Chinese semantics and Chinese-specific images, advancing the journey towards expert artificial general intelligence (AGI).

|**2024-10-17**|**Retrospective Learning from Interactions**|Multi-turn interactions between large language models (LLMs) and users naturally include implicit feedback signals. If an LLM responds in an unexpected way to an instruction, the user is likely to signal it by rephrasing the request, expressing frustration, or pivoting to an alternative task. Such signals are task-independent and occupy a relatively constrained subspace of language, allowing the LLM to identify them even if it fails on the actual task. This creates an avenue for continually learning from interactions without additional annotations. We introduce ReSpect, a method to learn from such signals in past interactions via retrospection. We deploy ReSpect in a new multimodal interaction scenario, where humans instruct an LLM to solve an abstract reasoning task with a combinatorial solution space. Through thousands of interactions with humans, we show how ReSpect gradually improves task completion rate from 31% to 82%, all without any external annotation.|Zizhao Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13852)|null|
|**2024-10-17**|**SimLayerKV: A Simple Framework for Layer-Level KV Cache Reduction**|Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their capabilities to handle long contexts. However, increasing the number of model layers and the length of input sequences significantly escalates the memory required to store key-value (KV) cache, posing challenges for efficient inference. To mitigate this issue, we present SimLayerKV, a simple yet effective method that reduces inter-layer KV cache redundancies by selectively dropping cache in identified lazy layers. Our approach is based on the observation that certain layers in long-context LLMs exhibit "lazy" behavior, contributing less to modeling long-range dependencies compared to non-lazy layers. By analyzing attention weight patterns, we find that the behavior of these lazy layers is consistent across tokens during generation for a given input. This insight motivates our SimLayerKV, which identifies lazy layers and reduces their KV cache accordingly. SimLayerKV is training-free, generalizable, and can be implemented with only seven lines of code. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative LLMs, e.g., LLaMA2-7B, LLaMA3-8B, and Mistral-7B across 16 tasks from the LongBench benchmark. The results demonstrate that SimLayerKV achieves a KV cache compression ratio of 5 $\times$ with only a 1.2% performance drop when combined with 4-bit quantization.

|**2024-10-17**|**Active-Dormant Attention Heads: Mechanistically Demystifying Extreme-Token Phenomena in LLMs**|Practitioners have consistently observed three puzzling phenomena in transformer-based large language models (LLMs): attention sinks, value-state drains, and residual-state peaks, collectively referred to as extreme-token phenomena. These phenomena are characterized by certain so-called "sink tokens" receiving disproportionately high attention weights, exhibiting significantly smaller value states, and having much larger residual-state norms than those of other tokens. These extreme tokens give rise to various challenges in LLM inference, quantization, and interpretability.   We elucidate the mechanisms behind extreme-token phenomena. First, we show that these phenomena arise in very simple architectures -- transformers with one to three layers -- trained on a toy model, the Bigram-Backcopy (BB) task. In this setting, we identify an active-dormant mechanism, where attention heads become sinks for specific input domains while remaining non-sinks for others. Our theoretical analysis of the training dynamics reveals that these phenomena are driven by a mutual reinforcement mechanism. Building on these insights, we propose strategies to mitigate extreme-token phenomena during pretraining, including replacing softmax with ReLU and Adam with SGD. Next, we extend our analysis to pretrained LLMs, including Llama and OLMo, showing that many attention heads exhibit a similar active-dormant mechanism as in the BB task, and that the mutual reinforcement mechanism also governs the emergence of extreme-token phenomena during LLM pretraining. Our results reveal that many of the static and dynamic properties of extreme-token phenomena predicted by the BB task align with observations in pretrained LLMs.|Tianyu Guo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13835)|null|

Automating web tasks (like booking hotels within a budget) is increasingly sought after. Fulfilling practical needs, the web agent also serves as an important proof-of-concept example for various agent grounding scenarios, with its success promising advancements in many future applications. Prior research often handcrafts web agent strategies (e.g., prompting templates, multi-agent systems, search methods, etc.) and the corresponding in-context examples, which may not generalize well across all real-world scenarios. On the other hand, there has been limited study on the misalignment between a web agent's observation/action representation and the pre-training data of the LLM it's based on. This discrepancy is especially notable when LLMs are primarily trained for language completion rather than tasks involving embodied navigation actions and symbolic web elements. Our study enhances an LLM-based web agent by simply refining its observation and action space to better align with the LLM's capabilities. This approach enables our base agent to significantly outperform previous methods on a wide variety of web tasks. Specifically, on WebArena, a benchmark featuring general-purpose web interaction tasks, our agent AgentOccam surpasses the previous state-of-the-art and concurrent work by 9.8 (+29.4%) and 5.9 (+15.8%) absolute points respectively, and boosts the success rate by 26.6 points (+161%) over similar plain web agents with its observation and action space alignment. We achieve this without using in-context examples, new agent roles, online feedback or search strategies. AgentOccam's simple design highlights LLMs' impressive zero-shot performance on web tasks, and underlines the critical role of carefully tuning observation and action spaces for LLM-based agents.|Ke Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13825)|null|
|**2024-10-16**|**Meta-Chunking: Learning Efficient Text Segmentation via Logical Perception**|Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while serving as a viable complement to large language models (LLMs), often overlooks the crucial aspect of text chunking within its pipeline, which impacts the quality of knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper introduces the concept of Meta-Chunking, which refers to a granularity between sentences and paragraphs, consisting of a collection of sentences within a paragraph that have deep linguistic logical connections. To implement Meta-Chunking, we designed two strategies based on LLMs: Margin Sampling Chunking and Perplexity Chunking. The former employs LLMs to perform binary classification on whether consecutive sentences need to be segmented, making decisions based on the probability difference obtained from margin sampling. The latter precisely identifies text chunk boundaries by analyzing the characteristics of perplexity distribution. Additionally, considering the inherent complexity of different texts, we propose a strategy that combines Meta-Chunking with dynamic merging to achieve a balance between fine-grained and coarse-grained text chunking. Experiments conducted on eleven datasets demonstrate that Meta-Chunking can more efficiently improve the performance of single-hop and multi-hop question answering based on RAG. For instance, on the 2WikiMultihopQA dataset, it outperforms similarity chunking by 1.32 while only consuming 45.8% of the time.

|**2024-10-16**|**JudgeBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM-based Judges**|LLM-based judges have emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation and are increasingly used to assess, compare, and improve models. However, the reliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs become more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring stronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a judge's alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more challenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of factual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we propose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging response pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench leverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into challenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges, fine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench poses a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many strong models (e.g., GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random guessing. Overall, JudgeBench offers a reliable platform for assessing increasingly advanced LLM-based judges.

However, leveraging the ICL capabilities within LLMs to directly predict robot actions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RoboPrompt, a framework that enables off-the-shelf text-only LLMs to directly predict robot actions through ICL without training. Our approach first heuristically identifies keyframes that capture important moments from an episode. Next, we extract end-effector actions from these keyframes as well as the estimated initial object poses, and both are converted into textual descriptions. Finally, we construct a structured template to form ICL demonstrations from these textual descriptions and a task instruction. This enables an LLM to directly predict robot actions at test time. Through extensive experiments and analysis, RoboPrompt shows stronger performance over zero-shot and ICL baselines in simulated and real-world settings.|Yida Yin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12782)|null|
|**2024-10-16**|**Identifying Task Groupings for Multi-Task Learning Using Pointwise V-Usable Information**|The success of multi-task learning can depend heavily on which tasks are grouped together. Naively grouping all tasks or a random set of tasks can result in negative transfer, with the multi-task models performing worse than single-task models. Though many efforts have been made to identify task groupings and to measure the relatedness among different tasks, it remains a challenging research topic to define a metric to identify the best task grouping out of a pool of many potential task combinations. We propose a metric of task relatedness based on task difficulty measured by pointwise V-usable information (PVI). PVI is a recently proposed metric to estimate how much usable information a dataset contains given a model. We hypothesize that tasks with not statistically different PVI estimates are similar enough to benefit from the joint learning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the feasibility of this metric for task grouping on 15 NLP datasets in the general, biomedical, and clinical domains. We compare the results of the joint learners against single learners, existing baseline methods, and recent large language models, including Llama 2 and GPT-4. The results show that by grouping tasks with similar PVI estimates, the joint learners yielded competitive results with fewer total parameters, with consistent performance across domains.|Yingya Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12774)|null|

However, the contrastive triplets often used for training these representations may vary in both style and content, leading to potential content leakage in the representations. We introduce StyleDistance, a novel approach to training stronger content-independent style embeddings. We use a large language model to create a synthetic dataset of near-exact paraphrases with controlled style variations, and produce positive and negative examples across 40 distinct style features for precise contrastive learning. We assess the quality of our synthetic data and embeddings through human and automatic evaluations. StyleDistance enhances the content-independence of style embeddings, which generalize to real-world benchmarks and outperform leading style representations in downstream applications.

|**2024-10-17**|**CREAM: Consistency Regularized Self-Rewarding Language Models**|Recent self-rewarding large language models (LLM) have successfully applied LLM-as-a-Judge to iteratively improve the alignment performance without the need of human annotations for preference data. These methods commonly utilize the same LLM to act as both the policy model (which generates responses) and the reward model (which scores and ranks those responses). The ranked responses are then used as preference pairs to train the LLM via direct alignment technologies (e.g. DPO). However, it is noteworthy that throughout this process, there is no guarantee of accuracy in the rewarding and ranking, which is critical for ensuring accurate rewards and high-quality preference data. Empirical results from relatively small LLMs (e.g., 7B parameters) also indicate that improvements from self-rewarding may diminish after several iterations in certain situations, which we hypothesize is due to accumulated bias in the reward system. This bias can lead to unreliable preference data for training the LLM. To address this issue, we first formulate and analyze the generalized iterative preference fine-tuning framework for self-rewarding language model. We then introduce the regularization to this generalized framework to mitigate the overconfident preference labeling in the self-rewarding process. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose a Consistency Regularized sElf-rewarding lAnguage Model (CREAM) that leverages the rewarding consistency across different iterations to regularize the self-rewarding training, helping the model to learn from more reliable preference data. With this explicit regularization, our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of CREAM in improving both reward consistency and alignment performance.

|**2024-10-16**|**FusionLLM: A Decentralized LLM Training System on Geo-distributed GPUs with Adaptive Compression**|To alleviate hardware scarcity in training large deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly large language models (LLMs), we present FusionLLM, a decentralized training system designed and implemented for training DNNs using geo-distributed GPUs across different computing clusters or individual devices. Decentralized training faces significant challenges regarding system design and efficiency, including: 1) the need for remote automatic differentiation (RAD), 2) support for flexible model definitions and heterogeneous software, 3) heterogeneous hardware leading to low resource utilization or the straggler problem, and 4) slow network communication. To address these challenges, in the system design, we represent the model as a directed acyclic graph of operators (OP-DAG). Each node in the DAG represents the operator in the DNNs, while the edge represents the data dependency between operators. Based on this design, 1) users are allowed to customize any DNN without caring low-level operator implementation; 2) we enable the task scheduling with the more fine-grained sub-tasks, offering more optimization space; 3) a DAG runtime executor can implement RAD withour requiring the consistent low-level ML framework versions.   To enhance system efficiency, we implement a workload estimator and design an OP-Fence scheduler to cluster devices with similar bandwidths together and partition the DAG to increase throughput. Additionally, we propose an AdaTopK compressor to adaptively compress intermediate activations and gradients at the slowest communication links. To evaluate the convergence and efficiency of our system and algorithms, we train ResNet-101 and GPT-2 on three real-world testbeds using 48 GPUs connected with 8 Mbps~10 Gbps networks.

Despite extensive research on Large Language Models (LLMs), the challenge of Text-to-Image (T2I) model alignment remains largely unexplored. Addressing this problem, we propose LiVO (Lightweight Value Optimization), a novel lightweight method for aligning T2I models with human values. LiVO only optimizes a plug-and-play value encoder to integrate a specified value principle with the input prompt, allowing the control of generated images over both semantics and values. Specifically, we design a diffusion model-tailored preference optimization loss, which theoretically approximates the Bradley-Terry model used in LLM alignment but provides a more flexible trade-off between image quality and value conformity. To optimize the value encoder, we also develop a framework to automatically construct a text-image preference dataset of 86k (prompt, aligned image, violating image, value principle) samples. Without updating most model parameters and through adaptive value selection from the input prompt, LiVO significantly reduces harmful outputs and achieves faster convergence, surpassing several strong baselines and taking an initial step towards ethically aligned T2I models.|Xingqi Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12700)|**[link](https://github.com/achernarwang/LiVO)**|

|**2024-10-16**|**Cross-Modal Safety Mechanism Transfer in Large Vision-Language Models**|Vision-language alignment in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) successfully enables LLMs to understand visual input. However, we find that existing vision-language alignment methods fail to transfer the existing safety mechanism for text in LLMs to vision, which leads to vulnerabilities in toxic image. To explore the cause of this problem, we give the insightful explanation of where and how the safety mechanism of LVLMs operates and conduct comparative analysis between text and vision. We find that the hidden states at the specific transformer layers play a crucial role in the successful activation of safety mechanism, while the vision-language alignment at hidden states level in current methods is insufficient. This results in a semantic shift for input images compared to text in hidden states, therefore misleads the safety mechanism. To address this, we propose a novel Text-Guided vision-language Alignment method (TGA) for LVLMs. TGA retrieves the texts related to input vision and uses them to guide the projection of vision into the hidden states space in LLMs. Experiments show that TGA not only successfully transfers the safety mechanism for text in basic LLMs to vision in vision-language alignment for LVLMs without any safety fine-tuning on the visual modality but also maintains the general performance on various vision tasks (Safe and Good).|Shicheng Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12662)|null|
|**2024-10-15**|**MoH: Multi-Head Attention as Mixture-of-Head Attention**|In this work, we upgrade the multi-head attention mechanism, the core of the Transformer model, to improve efficiency while maintaining or surpassing the previous accuracy level. We show that multi-head attention can be expressed in the summation form. Drawing on the insight that not all attention heads hold equal significance, we propose Mixture-of-Head attention (MoH), a new architecture that treats attention heads as experts in the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism. MoH has two significant advantages: First, MoH enables each token to select the appropriate attention heads, enhancing inference efficiency without compromising accuracy or increasing the number of parameters. Second, MoH replaces the standard summation in multi-head attention with a weighted summation, introducing flexibility to the attention mechanism and unlocking extra performance potential. Extensive experiments on ViT, DiT, and LLMs demonstrate that MoH outperforms multi-head attention by using only 50%-90% of the attention heads. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-trained multi-head attention models, such as LLaMA3-8B, can be further continue-tuned into our MoH models. Notably, MoH-LLaMA3-8B achieves an average accuracy of 64.0% across 14 benchmarks, outperforming LLaMA3-8B by 2.4% by utilizing only 75% of the attention heads. We believe the proposed MoH is a promising alternative to multi-head attention and provides a strong foundation for developing advanced and efficient attention-based models.|Peng Jin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11842)|**[link](https://github.com/skyworkai/moh)**|

However, they face challenges in modeling user-item collaborative preferences, personalizing explanations, and handling sparse user-item interactions. To address these issues, we propose GaVaMoE, a novel Gaussian-Variational Gated Mixture of Experts framework for explainable recommendation. GaVaMoE introduces two key components: (1) a rating reconstruction module that employs Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to capture complex user-item collaborative preferences, serving as a pre-trained multi-gating mechanism; and (2) a set of fine-grained expert models coupled with the multi-gating mechanism for generating highly personalized explanations. The VAE component models latent factors in user-item interactions, while the GMM clusters users with similar behaviors. Each cluster corresponds to a gate in the multi-gating mechanism, routing user-item pairs to appropriate expert models. This architecture enables GaVaMoE to generate tailored explanations for specific user types and preferences, mitigating data sparsity by leveraging user similarities. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GaVaMoE significantly outperforms existing methods in explanation quality, personalization, and consistency. Notably, GaVaMoE exhibits robust performance in scenarios with sparse user-item interactions, maintaining high-quality explanations even for users with limited historical data.|Fei Tang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11841)|null|

Previous methods integrating multiple vision encoders to enhance visual detail introduce redundancy and computational overhead. We observe that most MLLMs utilize only the last-layer feature map of the vision encoder for visual representation, neglecting the rich fine-grained information in shallow feature maps. To address this issue, we propose \modelname, a simple yet effective multi-layer feature fuser that efficiently integrates deep and shallow features from Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, it leverages semantically aligned deep features as queries to dynamically extract missing details from shallow features, thus preserving semantic alignment while enriching the representation with fine-grained information. Applied to the LLaVA-1.5 model, \modelname~achieves significant improvements in visual representation and benchmark performance, providing a more flexible and lightweight solution compared to multi-encoder ensemble methods.

It can serve as a natural interface for image editing, dramatically improving precision and flexibility. Leveraging this benefit, we introduce a new framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with Text2Image generative model for scene graph-based image editing. This integration enables precise modifications at the object level and creative recomposition of scenes without compromising overall image integrity. Our approach involves two primary stages: 1) Utilizing a LLM-driven scene parser, we construct an image's scene graph, capturing key objects and their interrelationships, as well as parsing fine-grained attributes such as object masks and descriptions. These annotations facilitate concept learning with a fine-tuned diffusion model, representing each object with an optimized token and detailed description prompt. 2) During the image editing phase, a LLM editing controller guides the edits towards specific areas. These edits are then implemented by an attention-modulated diffusion editor, utilizing the fine-tuned model to perform object additions, deletions, replacements, and adjustments. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing image editing methods in terms of editing precision and scene aesthetics.|Zhiyuan Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11815)|null|

During tool learning, LLMs may call multiple tools in nested orders, where the latter tool call may take the former response as its input parameters. However, current research on the nested tool learning capabilities is still under-explored, since the existing benchmarks lack of relevant data instances. To address this problem, we introduce NesTools to bridge the current gap in comprehensive nested tool learning evaluations. NesTools comprises a novel automatic data generation method to construct large-scale nested tool calls with different nesting structures. With manual review and refinement, the dataset is in high quality and closely aligned with real-world scenarios. Therefore, NesTools can serve as a new benchmark to evaluate the nested tool learning abilities of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on 22 LLMs, and provide in-depth analyses with NesTools, which shows that current LLMs still suffer from the complex nested tool learning task.|Han Han et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11805)|null|
|**2024-10-15**|**FoundTS: Comprehensive and Unified Benchmarking of Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting**|Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is key functionality in numerous fields, including in finance, weather services, and energy management. While TSF methods are emerging these days, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and struggle with poor generalization performance on new domains. Foundation models aim to overcome this limitation. Pre-trained on large-scale language or time series data, they exhibit promising inferencing capabilities in new or unseen data. This has spurred a surge in new TSF foundation models. We propose a new benchmark, FoundTS, to enable thorough and fair evaluation and comparison of such models. FoundTS covers a variety of TSF foundation models, including those based on large language models and those pretrained on time series. Next, FoundTS supports different forecasting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, thereby facilitating more thorough evaluations. Finally, FoundTS offers a pipeline that standardizes evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, thereby facilitating fair evaluations. Building on this, we report on an extensive evaluation of TSF foundation models on a broad range of datasets from diverse domains and with different statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing foundation models, and we identify directions for future model design.

To mitigate the additional computational and financial costs associated with in-context learning, several prompt compression methods have been proposed to compress the in-context learning prompts. Despite their success, these methods face challenges with transferability due to model-specific compression, or rely on external training data, such as GPT-4. In this paper, we investigate the ability of LLMs to develop a unified compression method that discretizes uninformative tokens, utilizing a self-supervised pre-training technique. By introducing a small number of parameters during the continual pre-training, the proposed Selection-p produces a probability for each input token, indicating whether to preserve or discard it. Experiments show Selection-p achieves state-of-the-art performance across numerous classification tasks, achieving compression rates of up to 10 times while experiencing only a marginal 0.8% decrease in performance. Moreover, it exhibits superior transferability to different models compared to prior work. Additionally, we further analyze how Selection-p helps maintain performance on in-context learning with long contexts.|Tsz Ting Chung et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11786)|null|

Despite the diverse and high-performing designs available, practitioners often face confusion when selecting the most effective pipeline for their specific task: \textit{Which topology is the best choice for my task, avoiding unnecessary communication token overhead while ensuring high-quality solution?} In response to this dilemma, we introduce G-Designer, an adaptive, efficient, and robust solution for multi-agent deployment, which dynamically designs task-aware, customized communication topologies. Specifically, G-Designer models the multi-agent system as a multi-agent network, leveraging a variational graph auto-encoder to encode both the nodes (agents) and a task-specific virtual node, and decodes a task-adaptive and high-performing communication topology. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks showcase that G-Designer is: \textbf{(1) high-performing}, achieving superior results on MMLU with accuracy at $84.50\%$ and on HumanEval with pass@1 at $89.90\%$; \textbf{(2) task-adaptive}, architecting communication protocols tailored to task difficulty, reducing token consumption by up to $95.33\%$ on HumanEval; and \textbf{(3) adversarially robust}, defending against agent adversarial attacks with merely $0.3\%$ accuracy drop.|Guibin Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11782)|null|
|**2024-10-15**|**Language Models Encode Numbers Using Digit Representations in Base 10**|Large language models (LLMs) frequently make errors when handling even simple numerical problems, such as comparing two small numbers. A natural hypothesis is that these errors stem from how LLMs represent numbers, and specifically, whether their representations of numbers capture their numeric values. We tackle this question from the observation that LLM errors on numerical tasks are often distributed across \textit{the digits} of the answer rather than normally around \textit{its numeric value}. Through a series of probing experiments and causal interventions, we show that LLMs internally represent numbers with individual circular representations per-digit in base 10. This digit-wise representation, as opposed to a value representation, sheds light on the error patterns of models on tasks involving numerical reasoning and could serve as a basis for future studies on analyzing numerical mechanisms in LLMs.|Amit Arnold Levy et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11781)|null|
|**2024-10-15**|**MLLM can see? Dynamic Correction Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation**|Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, but the underlying reasons remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis and find that, although MLLMs incorrectly generate the objects in the final output, they are actually able to recognize visual objects in the preceding layers. We speculate that this may be due to the strong knowledge priors of the language model suppressing the visual information, leading to hallucinations. Motivated by this, we propose a novel dynamic correction decoding method for MLLMs (DeCo), which adaptively selects the appropriate preceding layers and proportionally integrates knowledge into the final layer to adjust the output logits. Note that DeCo is model agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated with various classic decoding strategies and applied to different MLLMs. We evaluate DeCo on widely-used benchmarks, demonstrating that it can reduce hallucination rates by a large margin compared to baselines, highlighting its potential to mitigate hallucinations.

|**2024-10-14**|**DuoAttention: Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference with Retrieval and Streaming Heads**|Deploying long-context large language models (LLMs) is essential but poses significant computational and memory challenges. Caching all Key and Value (KV) states across all attention heads consumes substantial memory. Existing KV cache pruning methods either damage the long-context capabilities of LLMs or offer only limited efficiency improvements. In this paper, we identify that only a fraction of attention heads, a.k.a, Retrieval Heads, are critical for processing long contexts and require full attention across all tokens. In contrast, all other heads, which primarily focus on recent tokens and attention sinks--referred to as Streaming Heads--do not require full attention. Based on this insight, we introduce DuoAttention, a framework that only applies a full KV cache to retrieval heads while using a light-weight, constant-length KV cache for streaming heads, which reduces both LLM's decoding and pre-filling memory and latency without compromising its long-context abilities. DuoAttention uses a lightweight, optimization-based algorithm with synthetic data to identify retrieval heads accurately. Our method significantly reduces long-context inference memory by up to 2.55x for MHA and 1.67x for GQA models while speeding up decoding by up to 2.18x and 1.50x and accelerating pre-filling by up to 1.73x and 1.63x for MHA and GQA models, respectively, with minimal accuracy loss compared to full attention. Notably, combined with quantization, DuoAttention enables Llama-3-8B decoding with 3.3 million context length on a single A100 GPU.

|**2024-10-15**|**TemporalBench: Benchmarking Fine-grained Temporal Understanding for Multimodal Video Models**|Understanding fine-grained temporal dynamics is crucial for multimodal video comprehension and generation. Due to the lack of fine-grained temporal annotations, existing video benchmarks mostly resemble static image benchmarks and are incompetent at evaluating models for temporal understanding. In this paper, we introduce TemporalBench, a new benchmark dedicated to evaluating fine-grained temporal understanding in videos. TemporalBench consists of ~10K video question-answer pairs, derived from ~2K high-quality human annotations detailing the temporal dynamics in video clips. As a result, our benchmark provides a unique testbed for evaluating various temporal understanding and reasoning abilities such as action frequency, motion magnitude, event order, etc. Moreover, it enables evaluations on various tasks like both video question answering and captioning, both short and long video understanding, as well as different models such as multimodal video embedding models and text generation models. Results show that state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o achieve only 38.5% question answering accuracy on TemporalBench, demonstrating a significant gap (~30%) between humans and AI in temporal understanding. Furthermore, we notice a critical pitfall for multi-choice QA where LLMs can detect the subtle changes in negative captions and find a centralized description as a cue for its prediction, where we propose Multiple Binary Accuracy (MBA) to correct such bias. We hope that TemporalBench can foster research on improving models' temporal reasoning capabilities.

|**2024-10-14**|**Your Mixture-of-Experts LLM Is Secretly an Embedding Model For Free**|While large language models (LLMs) excel on generation tasks, their decoder-only architecture often limits their potential as embedding models if no further representation finetuning is applied. Does this contradict their claim of generalists? To answer the question, we take a closer look at Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs. Our study shows that the expert routers in MoE LLMs can serve as an off-the-shelf embedding model with promising performance on a diverse class of embedding-focused tasks, without requiring any finetuning. Moreover, our extensive analysis shows that the MoE routing weights (RW) is complementary to the hidden state (HS) of LLMs, a widely-used embedding. Compared to HS, we find that RW is more robust to the choice of prompts and focuses on high-level semantics. Motivated by the analysis, we propose MoEE combining RW and HS, which achieves better performance than using either separately. Our exploration of their combination and prompting strategy shed several novel insights, e.g., a weighted sum of RW and HS similarities outperforms the similarity on their concatenation. Our experiments are conducted on 6 embedding tasks with 20 datasets from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). The results demonstrate the significant improvement brought by MoEE to LLM-based embedding without further finetuning.|Ziyue Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10814)|null|

However, their long-term memory capabilities in sustained interactions remain underexplored. This paper introduces LongMemEval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate five core long-term memory abilities of chat assistants: information extraction, multi-session reasoning, temporal reasoning, knowledge updates, and abstention. With 500 meticulously curated questions embedded within freely scalable user-assistant chat histories, LongMemEval presents a significant challenge to existing long-term memory systems, with commercial chat assistants and long-context LLMs showing 30% accuracy drop on memorizing information across sustained interactions. We then present a unified framework that breaks down the long-term memory design into four design choices across the indexing, retrieval, and reading stages. Built upon key experimental insights, we propose several memory designs including session decomposition for optimizing value granularity, fact-augmented key expansion for enhancing the index structure, and time-aware query expansion for refining the search scope. Experiment results show that these optimizations greatly improve both memory recall and downstream question answering on LongMemEval. Overall, our study provides valuable resources and guidance for advancing the long-term memory capabilities of LLM-based chat assistants, paving the way toward more personalized and reliable conversational AI.|Di Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813)|**[link](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/longmemeval)**|

However, ensuring their safe use remains a significant challenge. Preference training and safety measures often overfit to harms prevalent in Western-centric datasets, and safety protocols frequently fail to extend to multilingual settings. In this work, we explore model merging in a diverse multi-task setting, combining safety and general-purpose tasks within a multilingual context. Each language introduces unique and varied learning challenges across tasks. We find that objective-based merging is more effective than mixing data, with improvements of up to 8% and 10% in general performance and safety respectively. We also find that language-based merging is highly effective -- by merging monolingually fine-tuned models, we achieve a 4% increase in general performance and 7% reduction in harm across all languages on top of the data mixtures method using the same available data. Overall, our comprehensive study of merging approaches provides a useful framework for building strong and safe multilingual models.|Aakanksha et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10801)|null|

However, we have identified that recent methods inevitably suffer from loss of image information during understanding task, due to either image discretization or diffusion denoising steps. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Auto-Regressive (MMAR) probabilistic modeling framework. Unlike discretization line of method, MMAR takes in continuous-valued image tokens to avoid information loss. Differing from diffusion-based approaches, we disentangle the diffusion process from auto-regressive backbone model by employing a light-weight diffusion head on top each auto-regressed image patch embedding. In this way, when the model transits from image generation to understanding through text generation, the backbone model's hidden representation of the image is not limited to the last denoising step. To successfully train our method, we also propose a theoretically proven technique that addresses the numerical stability issue and a training strategy that balances the generation and understanding task goals. Through extensive evaluations on 18 image understanding benchmarks, MMAR demonstrates much more superior performance than other joint multi-modal models, matching the method that employs pretrained CLIP vision encoder, meanwhile being able to generate high quality images at the same time. We also showed that our method is scalable with larger data and model size.|Jian Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10798)|null|
|**2024-10-14**|**Context-Parametric Inversion: Why Instruction Finetuning May Not Actually Improve Context Reliance**|Large language models are instruction-finetuned to enhance their ability to follow user instructions and process the input context. However, even state-of-the-art models often struggle to follow the instruction, especially when the input context is not aligned with the model's parametric knowledge. This manifests as various failures, such as hallucinations where the responses are outdated, biased or contain unverified facts. In this work, we try to understand the underlying reason for this poor context reliance, especially after instruction tuning. We observe an intriguing phenomenon: during instruction tuning, the context reliance initially increases as expected, but then gradually decreases as instruction finetuning progresses. We call this phenomenon context-parametric inversion and observe it across multiple general purpose instruction tuning datasets like TULU, Alpaca and Ultrachat, as well as model families such as Llama, Mistral and Pythia. In a simple theoretical setup, we isolate why context-parametric inversion occurs along the gradient descent trajectory of instruction finetuning. We tie this phenomena to examples in the instruction finetuning data mixture where the input context provides information that is already present in the model's parametric knowledge. Our analysis suggests natural mitigation strategies that provide some limited gains, while also validating our theoretical insights. We hope that our work serves as a starting point in addressing this failure mode in a staple part of LLM training.|Sachin Goyal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10796)|**[link](https://github.com/locuslab/context-parametric-inversion)**|

To address these issues, we introduce Focused ReAct, an enhanced version of the ReAct paradigm that incorporates reiteration and early stop mechanisms. These improvements help the model stay focused on the original query and avoid repetitive behaviors. Experimental results show accuracy gains of 18% to 530% and a runtime reduction of up to 34% compared to the original ReAct method.|Shuoqiu Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10779)|null|
|**2024-10-14**|**AFlow: Automating Agentic Workflow Generation**|Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in solving complex tasks across diverse domains, typically by employing agentic workflows that follow detailed instructions and operational sequences. However, constructing these workflows requires significant human effort, limiting scalability and generalizability. Recent research has sought to automate the generation and optimization of these workflows, but existing methods still rely on initial manual setup and fall short of achieving fully automated and effective workflow generation. To address this challenge, we reformulate workflow optimization as a search problem over code-represented workflows, where LLM-invoking nodes are connected by edges. We introduce AFlow, an automated framework that efficiently explores this space using Monte Carlo Tree Search, iteratively refining workflows through code modification, tree-structured experience, and execution feedback. Empirical evaluations across six benchmark datasets demonstrate AFlow's efficacy, yielding a 5.7% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, AFlow enables smaller models to outperform GPT-4o on specific tasks at 4.55% of its inference cost in dollars.

|**2024-10-14**|**Denial-of-Service Poisoning Attacks against Large Language Models**|Recent studies have shown that LLMs are vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where adversarial inputs like spelling errors or non-semantic prompts trigger endless outputs without generating an [EOS] token. These attacks can potentially cause high latency and make LLM services inaccessible to other users or tasks. However, when there are speech-to-text interfaces (e.g., voice commands to a robot), executing such DoS attacks becomes challenging, as it is difficult to introduce spelling errors or non-semantic prompts through speech. A simple DoS attack in these scenarios would be to instruct the model to "Keep repeating Hello", but we observe that relying solely on natural instructions limits output length, which is bounded by the maximum length of the LLM's supervised finetuning (SFT) data. To overcome this limitation, we propose poisoning-based DoS (P-DoS) attacks for LLMs, demonstrating that injecting a single poisoned sample designed for DoS purposes can break the output length limit. For example, a poisoned sample can successfully attack GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini (via OpenAI's finetuning API) using less than $1, causing repeated outputs up to the maximum inference length (16K tokens, compared to 0.5K before poisoning). Additionally, we perform comprehensive ablation studies on open-source LLMs and extend our method to LLM agents, where attackers can control both the finetuning dataset and algorithm. Our findings underscore the urgent need for defenses against P-DoS attacks to secure LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/P-DoS.|Kuofeng Gao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10760)|**[link](https://github.com/sail-sg/p-dos)**|

However, concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs for code persist despite their widespread use. Much of the existing research focused on either training or evaluation, raising questions about whether stakeholders in training and evaluation align in their understanding of model trustworthiness and whether they can move toward a unified direction. In this paper, we propose a vision for a unified trustworthiness auditing framework, DataTrust, which adopts a data-centric approach that synergistically emphasizes both training and evaluation data and their correlations. DataTrust aims to connect model trustworthiness indicators in evaluation with data quality indicators in training. It autonomously inspects training data and evaluates model trustworthiness using synthesized data, attributing potential causes from specific evaluation data to corresponding training data and refining indicator connections. Additionally, a trustworthiness arena powered by DataTrust will engage crowdsourced input and deliver quantitative outcomes. We outline the benefits that various stakeholders can gain from DataTrust and discuss the challenges and opportunities it presents.|Chong Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09048)|null|
|**2024-10-11**|**Unraveling and Mitigating Safety Alignment Degradation of Vision-Language Models**|The safety alignment ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is prone to be degraded by the integration of the vision module compared to its LLM backbone. We investigate this phenomenon, dubbed as ''safety alignment degradation'' in this paper, and show that the challenge arises from the representation gap that emerges when introducing vision modality to VLMs. In particular, we show that the representations of multi-modal inputs shift away from that of text-only inputs which represent the distribution that the LLM backbone is optimized for. At the same time, the safety alignment capabilities, initially developed within the textual embedding space, do not successfully transfer to this new multi-modal representation space. To reduce safety alignment degradation, we introduce Cross-Modality Representation Manipulation (CMRM), an inference time representation intervention method for recovering the safety alignment ability that is inherent in the LLM backbone of VLMs, while simultaneously preserving the functional capabilities of VLMs. The empirical results show that our framework significantly recovers the alignment ability that is inherited from the LLM backbone with minimal impact on the fluency and linguistic capabilities of pre-trained VLMs even without additional training. Specifically, the unsafe rate of LLaVA-7B on multi-modal input can be reduced from 61.53% to as low as 3.15% with only inference-time intervention.

We first observe a positive correlation between the effectiveness of attacks and the internal behaviors of the models. For instance, attacks tend to be less effective when models pay more attention to system prompts designed to ensure LLM safety alignment. Building on this discovery, we introduce an enhanced method that manipulates models' attention scores to facilitate LLM jailbreaking, which we term AttnGCG. Empirically, AttnGCG shows consistent improvements in attack efficacy across diverse LLMs, achieving an average increase of ~7% in the Llama-2 series and ~10% in the Gemma series. Our strategy also demonstrates robust attack transferability against both unseen harmful goals and black-box LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Moreover, we note our attention-score visualization is more interpretable, allowing us to gain better insights into how our targeted attention manipulation facilitates more effective jailbreaking.

A collection of predictive ``experts'' is learned along with a ``gating function'' that controls how much influence each expert is given when a prediction is made. This structure allows relatively simple models to excel in complex, heterogeneous data settings. In many contemporary settings, unlabeled data are widely available while labeled data are difficult to obtain. Semi-supervised learning methods seek to leverage the unlabeled data. We propose a novel method for semi-supervised learning of MoE models. We start from a semi-supervised MoE model that was developed by oceanographers that makes the strong assumption that the latent clustering structure in unlabeled data maps directly to the influence that the gating function should give each expert in the supervised task. We relax this assumption, imagining a noisy connection between the two, and propose an algorithm based on least trimmed squares, which succeeds even in the presence of misaligned data. Our theoretical analysis characterizes the conditions under which our approach yields estimators with a near-parametric rate of convergence.

|**2024-10-11**|**SimpleStrat: Diversifying Language Model Generation with Stratification**|Generating diverse responses from large language models (LLMs) is crucial for applications such as planning/search and synthetic data generation, where diversity provides distinct answers across generations. Prior approaches rely on increasing temperature to increase diversity. However, contrary to popular belief, we show not only does this approach produce lower quality individual generations as temperature increases, but it depends on model's next-token probabilities being similar to the true distribution of answers. We propose \method{}, an alternative approach that uses the language model itself to partition the space into strata. At inference, a random stratum is selected and a sample drawn from within the strata. To measure diversity, we introduce CoverageQA, a dataset of underspecified questions with multiple equally plausible answers, and assess diversity by measuring KL Divergence between the output distribution and uniform distribution over valid ground truth answers. As computing probability per response/solution for proprietary models is infeasible, we measure recall on ground truth solutions. Our evaluation show using SimpleStrat achieves higher recall by 0.05 compared to GPT-4o and 0.36 average reduction in KL Divergence compared to Llama 3.|Justin Wong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09038)|null|
|**2024-10-11**|**Mentor-KD: Making Small Language Models Better Multi-step Reasoners**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have displayed remarkable performances across various complex tasks by leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Recently, studies have proposed a Knowledge Distillation (KD) approach, reasoning distillation, which transfers such reasoning ability of LLMs through fine-tuning language models of multi-step rationales generated by LLM teachers. However, they have inadequately considered two challenges regarding insufficient distillation sets from the LLM teacher model, in terms of 1) data quality and 2) soft label provision. In this paper, we propose Mentor-KD, which effectively distills the multi-step reasoning capability of LLMs to smaller LMs while addressing the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, we exploit a mentor, intermediate-sized task-specific fine-tuned model, to augment additional CoT annotations and provide soft labels for the student model during reasoning distillation. We conduct extensive experiments and confirm Mentor-KD's effectiveness across various models and complex reasoning tasks.|Hojae Lee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09037)|**[link](https://github.com/2hojae/mentor-kd)**|

It has been widely adopted across scientific research fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science, as well as in industrial applications such as semiconductor characterization. In practice, obtaining high-quality ptychographic images requires simultaneous optimization of numerous experimental and algorithmic parameters. Traditionally, parameter selection often relies on trial and error, leading to low-throughput workflows and potential human bias. In this work, we develop the "Ptychographic Experiment and Analysis Robot" (PEAR), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate data analysis in ptychography. To ensure high robustness and accuracy, PEAR employs multiple LLM agents for tasks including knowledge retrieval, code generation, parameter recommendation, and image reasoning. Our study demonstrates that PEAR's multi-agent design significantly improves the workflow success rate, even with smaller open-weight models such as LLaMA 3.1 8B. PEAR also supports various automation levels and is designed to work with customized local knowledge bases, ensuring flexibility and adaptability across different research environments.|Xiangyu Yin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09034)|null|
|**2024-10-11**|**AgentHarm: A Benchmark for Measuring Harmfulness of LLM Agents**|The robustness of LLMs to jailbreak attacks, where users design prompts to circumvent safety measures and misuse model capabilities, has been studied primarily for LLMs acting as simple chatbots. Meanwhile, LLM agents -- which use external tools and can execute multi-stage tasks -- may pose a greater risk if misused, but their robustness remains underexplored. To facilitate research on LLM agent misuse, we propose a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. We evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. We publicly release AgentHarm to enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents. We publicly release the benchmark at https://huggingface.co/ai-safety-institute/AgentHarm.|Maksym Andriushchenko et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09024)|null|
|**2024-10-11**|**The Impact of Visual Information in Chinese Characters: Evaluating Large Models' Ability to Recognize and Utilize Radicals**|The glyphic writing system of Chinese incorporates information-rich visual features in each character, such as radicals that provide hints about meaning or pronunciation. However, there has been no investigation into whether contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can harness these sub-character features in Chinese through prompting. In this study, we establish a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' and VLMs' understanding of visual elements in Chinese characters, including radicals, composition structures, strokes, and stroke counts. Our results reveal that models surprisingly exhibit some, but still limited, knowledge of the visual information, regardless of whether images of characters are provided. To incite models' ability to use radicals, we further experiment with incorporating radicals into the prompts for Chinese language understanding tasks. We observe consistent improvement in Part-Of-Speech tagging when providing additional information about radicals, suggesting the potential to enhance CLP by integrating sub-character information.|Xiaofeng Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09013)|null|
|**2024-10-10**|**Mono-InternVL: Pushing the Boundaries of Monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models with Endogenous Visual Pre-training**|The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to an influx of efforts to extend their capabilities to multimodal tasks. Among them, growing attention has been focused on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single LLM. Despite the structural simplicity and deployment-friendliness, training a monolithic MLLM with promising performance still remains challenging. In particular, the popular approaches adopt continuous pre-training to extend a pre-trained LLM to a monolithic MLLM, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting and leads to performance degeneration. In this paper, we aim to overcome this limitation from the perspective of delta tuning. Specifically, our core idea is to embed visual parameters into a pre-trained LLM, thereby incrementally learning visual knowledge from massive data via delta tuning, i.e., freezing the LLM when optimizing the visual parameters. Based on this principle, we present Mono-InternVL, a novel monolithic MLLM that seamlessly integrates a set of visual experts via a multimodal mixture-of-experts structure. Moreover, we propose an innovative pre-training strategy to maximize the visual capability of Mono-InternVL, namely Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP). In particular, EViP is designed as a progressive learning process for visual experts, which aims to fully exploit the visual knowledge from noisy data to high-quality data. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 16 benchmarks. Experimental results not only validate the superior performance of Mono-InternVL compared to the state-of-the-art MLLM on 6 multimodal benchmarks, e.g., +113 points over InternVL-1.5 on OCRBench, but also confirm its better deployment efficiency, with first token latency reduced by up to 67%.|Gen Luo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08202)|null|
|**2024-10-10**|**From Exploration to Mastery: Enabling LLMs to Master Tools via Self-Driven Interactions**|Tool learning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external environments by invoking tools, serving as an effective strategy to mitigate the limitations inherent in their pre-training data. In this process, tool documentation plays a crucial role by providing usage instructions for LLMs, thereby facilitating effective tool utilization. This paper concentrates on the critical challenge of bridging the comprehension gap between LLMs and external tools due to the inadequacies and inaccuracies inherent in existing human-centric tool documentation. We propose a novel framework, DRAFT, aimed at Dynamically Refining tool documentation through the Analysis of Feedback and Trails emanating from LLMs' interactions with external tools. This methodology pivots on an innovative trial-and-error approach, consisting of three distinct learning phases: experience gathering, learning from experience, and documentation rewriting, to iteratively enhance the tool documentation. This process is further optimized by implementing a diversity-promoting exploration strategy to ensure explorative diversity and a tool-adaptive termination mechanism to prevent overfitting while enhancing efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DRAFT's iterative, feedback-based refinement significantly ameliorates documentation quality, fostering a deeper comprehension and more effective utilization of tools by LLMs. Notably, our analysis reveals that the tool documentation refined via our approach demonstrates robust cross-model generalization capabilities.|Changle Qu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08197)|**[link](https://github.com/quchangle1/DRAFT)**|
|**2024-10-10**|**MathCoder2: Better Math Reasoning from Continued Pretraining on Model-translated Mathematical Code**|Code has been shown to be effective in enhancing the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models due to its precision and accuracy. Previous works involving continued mathematical pretraining often include code that utilizes math-related packages, which are primarily designed for fields such as engineering, machine learning, signal processing, or module testing, rather than being directly focused on mathematical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for generating mathematical code accompanied with corresponding reasoning steps for continued pretraining. Our approach begins with the construction of a high-quality mathematical continued pretraining dataset by incorporating math-related web data, code using mathematical packages, math textbooks, and synthetic data. Next, we construct reasoning steps by extracting LaTeX expressions, the conditions needed for the expressions, and the results of the expressions from the previously collected dataset. Based on this extracted information, we generate corresponding code to accurately capture the mathematical reasoning process. Appending the generated code to each reasoning step results in data consisting of paired natural language reasoning steps and their corresponding code. Combining this data with the original dataset results in a 19.2B-token high-performing mathematical pretraining corpus, which we name MathCode-Pile. Training several popular base models with this corpus significantly improves their mathematical abilities, leading to the creation of the MathCoder2 family of models. All of our data processing and training code is open-sourced, ensuring full transparency and easy reproducibility of the entire data collection and training pipeline.

|**2024-10-10**|**GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model for Test-time Alignment**|Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but require careful alignment with human preferences. Traditional training-time methods finetune LLMs using human preference datasets but incur significant training costs and require repeated training to handle diverse user preferences. Test-time alignment methods address this by using reward models (RMs) to guide frozen LLMs without retraining. However, existing test-time approaches rely on trajectory-level RMs which are designed to evaluate complete responses, making them unsuitable for autoregressive text generation that requires computing next-token rewards from partial responses. To address this, we introduce GenARM, a test-time alignment approach that leverages the Autoregressive Reward Model--a novel reward parametrization designed to predict next-token rewards for efficient and effective autoregressive generation. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this parametrization can provably guide frozen LLMs toward any distribution achievable by traditional RMs within the KL-regularized reinforcement learning framework. Experimental results show that GenARM significantly outperforms prior test-time alignment baselines and matches the performance of training-time methods. Additionally, GenARM enables efficient weak-to-strong guidance, aligning larger LLMs with smaller RMs without the high costs of training larger models. Furthermore, GenARM supports multi-objective alignment, allowing real-time trade-offs between preference dimensions and catering to diverse user preferences without retraining.|Yuancheng Xu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08193)|null|
|**2024-10-10**|**SG-Nav: Online 3D Scene Graph Prompting for LLM-based Zero-shot Object Navigation**|In this paper, we propose a new framework for zero-shot object navigation. Existing zero-shot object navigation methods prompt LLM with the text of spatially closed objects, which lacks enough scene context for in-depth reasoning. To better preserve the information of environment and fully exploit the reasoning ability of LLM, we propose to represent the observed scene with 3D scene graph. The scene graph encodes the relationships between objects, groups and rooms with a LLM-friendly structure, for which we design a hierarchical chain-of-thought prompt to help LLM reason the goal location according to scene context by traversing the nodes and edges. Moreover, benefit from the scene graph representation, we further design a re-perception mechanism to empower the object navigation framework with the ability to correct perception error. We conduct extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D and RoboTHOR environments, where SG-Nav surpasses previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by more than 10% SR on all benchmarks, while the decision process is explainable. To the best of our knowledge, SG-Nav is the first zero-shot method that achieves even higher performance than supervised object navigation methods on the challenging MP3D benchmark.|Hang Yin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08189)|null|
|**2024-10-10**|**Sample then Identify: A General Framework for Risk Control and Assessment in Multimodal Large Language Models**|Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit promising advancements across various tasks, yet they still encounter significant trustworthiness issues. Prior studies apply Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) in language modeling to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees. However, these methods typically rely on internal model logits or are restricted to multiple-choice settings, which hampers their generalizability and adaptability in dynamic, open-ended environments. In this paper, we introduce TRON, a two-step framework for risk control and assessment, applicable to any MLLM that supports sampling in both open-ended and closed-ended scenarios. TRON comprises two main components: (1) a novel conformal score to sample response sets of minimum size, and (2) a nonconformity score to identify high-quality responses based on self-consistency theory, controlling the error rates by two specific risk levels. Furthermore, we investigate semantic redundancy in prediction sets within open-ended contexts for the first time, leading to a promising evaluation metric for MLLMs based on average set size. Our comprehensive experiments across four Video Question-Answering (VideoQA) datasets utilizing eight MLLMs show that TRON achieves desired error rates bounded by two user-specified risk levels. Additionally, deduplicated prediction sets maintain adaptiveness while being more efficient and stable for risk assessment under different risk levels.|Qingni Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08174)|null|
|**2024-10-10**|**On the Evaluation of Generative Robotic Simulations**|Due to the difficulty of acquiring extensive real-world data, robot simulation has become crucial for parallel training and sim-to-real transfer, highlighting the importance of scalable simulated robotic tasks. Foundation models have demonstrated impressive capacities in autonomously generating feasible robotic tasks. However, this new paradigm underscores the challenge of adequately evaluating these autonomously generated tasks. To address this, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored to generative simulations. Our framework segments evaluation into three core aspects: quality, diversity, and generalization. For single-task quality, we evaluate the realism of the generated task and the completeness of the generated trajectories using large language models and vision-language models. In terms of diversity, we measure both task and data diversity through text similarity of task descriptions and world model loss trained on collected task trajectories. For task-level generalization, we assess the zero-shot generalization ability on unseen tasks of a policy trained with multiple generated tasks. Experiments conducted on three representative task generation pipelines demonstrate that the results from our framework are highly consistent with human evaluations, confirming the feasibility and validity of our approach. The findings reveal that while metrics of quality and diversity can be achieved through certain methods, no single approach excels across all metrics, suggesting a need for greater focus on balancing these different metrics. Additionally, our analysis further highlights the common challenge of low generalization capability faced by current works.

|**2024-10-10**|**Agent S: An Open Agentic Framework that Uses Computers Like a Human**|We present Agent S, an open agentic framework that enables autonomous interaction with computers through a Graphical User Interface (GUI), aimed at transforming human-computer interaction by automating complex, multi-step tasks. Agent S aims to address three key challenges in automating computer tasks: acquiring domain-specific knowledge, planning over long task horizons, and handling dynamic, non-uniform interfaces. To this end, Agent S introduces experience-augmented hierarchical planning, which learns from external knowledge search and internal experience retrieval at multiple levels, facilitating efficient task planning and subtask execution. In addition, it employs an Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) to better elicit the reasoning and control capabilities of GUI agents based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark shows that Agent S outperforms the baseline by 9.37% on success rate (an 83.6% relative improvement) and achieves a new state-of-the-art. Comprehensive analysis highlights the effectiveness of individual components and provides insights for future improvements. Furthermore, Agent S demonstrates broad generalizability to different operating systems on a newly-released WindowsAgentArena benchmark.

|**2024-10-10**|**Rewarding Progress: Scaling Automated Process Verifiers for LLM Reasoning**|A promising approach for improving reasoning in large language models is to use process reward models (PRMs). PRMs provide feedback at each step of a multi-step reasoning trace, potentially improving credit assignment over outcome reward models (ORMs) that only provide feedback at the final step. However, collecting dense, per-step human labels is not scalable, and training PRMs from automatically-labeled data has thus far led to limited gains. To improve a base policy by running search against a PRM or using it as dense rewards for reinforcement learning (RL), we ask: "How should we design process rewards?". Our key insight is that, to be effective, the process reward for a step should measure progress: a change in the likelihood of producing a correct response in the future, before and after taking the step, corresponding to the notion of step-level advantages in RL. Crucially, this progress should be measured under a prover policy distinct from the base policy. We theoretically characterize the set of good provers and our results show that optimizing process rewards from such provers improves exploration during test-time search and online RL. In fact, our characterization shows that weak prover policies can substantially improve a stronger base policy, which we also observe empirically. We validate our claims by training process advantage verifiers (PAVs) to predict progress under such provers, and show that compared to ORMs, test-time search against PAVs is $>8\%$ more accurate, and $1.5-5\times$ more compute-efficient. Online RL with dense rewards from PAVs enables one of the first results with $5-6\times$ gain in sample efficiency, and $>6\%$ gain in accuracy, over ORMs.|Amrith Setlur et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08146)|null|
|**2024-10-10**|**Insight Over Sight? Exploring the Vision-Knowledge Conflicts in Multimodal LLMs**|This paper explores the problem of commonsense-level vision-knowledge conflict in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where visual information contradicts model's internal commonsense knowledge (see Figure 1). To study this issue, we introduce an automated pipeline, augmented with human-in-the-loop quality control, to establish a benchmark aimed at simulating and assessing the conflicts in MLLMs. Utilizing this pipeline, we have crafted a diagnostic benchmark comprising 374 original images and 1,122 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs. This benchmark covers two types of conflict target and three question difficulty levels, providing a thorough assessment tool. Through this benchmark, we evaluate the conflict-resolution capabilities of nine representative MLLMs across various model families and find a noticeable over-reliance on textual queries. Drawing on these findings, we propose a novel prompting strategy, "Focus-on-Vision" (FoV), which markedly enhances MLLMs' ability to favor visual data over conflicting textual knowledge. Our detailed analysis and the newly proposed strategy significantly advance the understanding and mitigating of vision-knowledge conflicts in MLLMs. The data and code are made publicly available.|Xiaoyuan Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08145)|null|
|**2024-10-09**|**MM-Ego: Towards Building Egocentric Multimodal LLMs**|This research aims to comprehensively explore building a multimodal foundation model for egocentric video understanding. To achieve this goal, we work on three fronts. First, as there is a lack of QA data for egocentric video understanding, we develop a data engine that efficiently generates 7M high-quality QA samples for egocentric videos ranging from 30 seconds to one hour long, based on human-annotated data. This is currently the largest egocentric QA dataset. Second, we contribute a challenging egocentric QA benchmark with 629 videos and 7,026 questions to evaluate the models' ability in recognizing and memorizing visual details across videos of varying lengths. We introduce a new de-biasing evaluation method to help mitigate the unavoidable language bias present in the models being evaluated. Third, we propose a specialized multimodal architecture featuring a novel "Memory Pointer Prompting" mechanism. This design includes a global glimpse step to gain an overarching understanding of the entire video and identify key visual information, followed by a fallback step that utilizes the key visual information to generate responses. This enables the model to more effectively comprehend extended video content. With the data, benchmark, and model, we successfully build MM-Ego, an egocentric multimodal LLM that shows powerful performance on egocentric video understanding.|Hanrong Ye et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07177)|null|
|**2024-10-09**|**Astute RAG: Overcoming Imperfect Retrieval Augmentation and Knowledge Conflicts for Large Language Models**|Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while effective in integrating external knowledge to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs), can be undermined by imperfect retrieval, which may introduce irrelevant, misleading, or even malicious information. Despite its importance, previous studies have rarely explored the behavior of RAG through joint analysis on how errors from imperfect retrieval attribute and propagate, and how potential conflicts arise between the LLMs' internal knowledge and external sources. We find that imperfect retrieval augmentation might be inevitable and quite harmful, through controlled analysis under realistic conditions. We identify the knowledge conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a bottleneck to overcome in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To render LLMs resilient to imperfect retrieval, we propose Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach that adaptively elicits essential information from LLMs' internal knowledge, iteratively consolidates internal and external knowledge with source-awareness, and finalizes the answer according to information reliability. Our experiments using Gemini and Claude demonstrate that Astute RAG significantly outperforms previous robustness-enhanced RAG methods. Notably, Astute RAG is the only approach that matches or exceeds the performance of LLMs without RAG under worst-case scenarios. Further analysis reveals that Astute RAG effectively resolves knowledge conflicts, improving the reliability and trustworthiness of RAG systems.|Fei Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07176)|null|
|**2024-10-09**|**Do better language models have crisper vision?**|How well do text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) grasp the visual world? As LLMs are increasingly used in computer vision, addressing this question becomes both fundamental and pertinent. However, existing studies have primarily focused on limited scenarios, such as their ability to generate visual content or cluster multimodal data. To this end, we propose the Visual Text Representation Benchmark (ViTeRB) to isolate key properties that make language models well-aligned with the visual world. With this, we identify large-scale decoder-based LLMs as ideal candidates for representing text in vision-centric contexts, counter to the current practice of utilizing text encoders. Building on these findings, we propose ShareLock, an ultra-lightweight CLIP-like model. By leveraging precomputable frozen features from strong vision and language models, ShareLock achieves an impressive 51% accuracy on ImageNet despite utilizing just 563k image-caption pairs. Moreover, training requires only 1 GPU hour (or 10 hours including the precomputation of features) - orders of magnitude less than prior methods.

|**2024-10-09**|**Glider: Global and Local Instruction-Driven Expert Router**|The availability of performant pre-trained models has led to a proliferation of fine-tuned expert models that are specialized to particular domains. This has enabled the creation of powerful and adaptive routing-based "Model MoErging" methods with the goal of using expert modules to create an aggregate system with improved performance or generalization. However, existing MoErging methods often prioritize generalization to unseen tasks at the expense of performance on held-in tasks, which limits its practical applicability in real-world deployment scenarios. We observe that current token-level routing mechanisms neglect the global semantic context of the input task. This token-wise independence hinders effective expert selection for held-in tasks, as routing decisions fail to incorporate the semantic properties of the task. To address this, we propose, Global and Local Instruction Driven Expert Router (GLIDER) that integrates a multi-scale routing mechanism, encompassing a semantic global router and a learned local router. The global router leverages LLM's advanced reasoning capabilities for semantic-related contexts to enhance expert selection. Given the input query and LLM, the router generates semantic task instructions that guide the retrieval of the most relevant experts across all layers. This global guidance is complemented by a local router that facilitates token-level routing decisions within each module, enabling finer control and enhanced performance on unseen tasks. Our experiments using T5-based models for T0 and FLAN tasks demonstrate that GLIDER achieves substantially improved held-in performance while maintaining strong generalization on held-out tasks. We also perform ablations experiments to dive deeper into the components of GLIDER. Our experiments highlight the importance of our multi-scale routing that leverages LLM-driven semantic reasoning for MoErging methods.|Pingzhi Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07172)|null|
|**2024-10-09**|**Deciphering Cross-Modal Alignment in Large Vision-Language Models with Modality Integration Rate**|We present the Modality Integration Rate (MIR), an effective, robust, and generalized metric to indicate the multi-modal pre-training quality of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). Large-scale pre-training plays a critical role in building capable LVLMs, while evaluating its training quality without the costly supervised fine-tuning stage is under-explored. Loss, perplexity, and in-context evaluation results are commonly used pre-training metrics for Large Language Models (LLMs), while we observed that these metrics are less indicative when aligning a well-trained LLM with a new modality. Due to the lack of proper metrics, the research of LVLMs in the critical pre-training stage is hindered greatly, including the training data choice, efficient module design, etc. In this paper, we propose evaluating the pre-training quality from the inter-modal distribution distance perspective and present MIR, the Modality Integration Rate, which is 1) \textbf{Effective} to represent the pre-training quality and show a positive relation with the benchmark performance after supervised fine-tuning. 2) \textbf{Robust} toward different training/evaluation data. 3) \textbf{Generalize} across training configurations and architecture choices. We conduct a series of pre-training experiments to explore the effectiveness of MIR and observe satisfactory results that MIR is indicative about training data selection, training strategy schedule, and model architecture design to get better pre-training results.

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.|Manling Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07166)|**[link](https://github.com/embodied-agent-interface/embodied-agent-interface)**|

Nevertheless, existing methods primarily focus on SMPL-based motion generation, which is limited by the scarcity of realistic large-scale interaction data. This constraint affects their ability to create everyday HOI scenes. This paper addresses this challenge using a zero-shot approach with a pre-trained diffusion model. Despite this potential, achieving our goals is difficult due to the diffusion model's lack of understanding of ''where'' and ''how'' objects interact with the human body. To tackle these issues, we introduce AvatarGO, a novel framework designed to generate animatable 4D HOI scenes directly from textual inputs. Specifically, 1) for the ''where'' challenge, we propose LLM-guided contact retargeting, which employs Lang-SAM to identify the contact body part from text prompts, ensuring precise representation of human-object spatial relations. 2) For the ''how'' challenge, we introduce correspondence-aware motion optimization that constructs motion fields for both human and object models using the linear blend skinning function from SMPL-X. Our framework not only generates coherent compositional motions, but also exhibits greater robustness in handling penetration issues. Extensive experiments with existing methods validate AvatarGO's superior generation and animation capabilities on a variety of human-object pairs and diverse poses. As the first attempt to synthesize 4D avatars with object interactions, we hope AvatarGO could open new doors for human-centric 4D content creation.|Yukang Cao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07164)|null|
|**2024-10-09**|**Simplicity Prevails: Rethinking Negative Preference Optimization for LLM Unlearning**|In this work, we address the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning, aiming to remove unwanted data influences and associated model capabilities (e.g., copyrighted data or harmful content generation) while preserving essential model utilities, without the need for retraining from scratch. Despite the growing need for LLM unlearning, a principled optimization framework remains lacking. To this end, we revisit the state-of-the-art approach, negative preference optimization (NPO), and identify the issue of reference model bias, which could undermine NPO's effectiveness, particularly when unlearning forget data of varying difficulty. Given that, we propose a simple yet effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that 'simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We also provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages, supported by analysis using mixtures of Markov chains. Furthermore, we present extensive experiments validating SimNPO's superiority over existing unlearning baselines in benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, and robustness against relearning attacks.

Existing 4D generation methods can generate high-quality 4D objects or scenes based on user-friendly conditions, benefiting the gaming and video industries. However, these methods struggle to synthesize significant object deformation of complex 4D transitions and interactions within scenes. To address this challenge, we propose Trans4D, a novel text-to-4D synthesis framework that enables realistic complex scene transitions. Specifically, we first use multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to produce a physic-aware scene description for 4D scene initialization and effective transition timing planning. Then we propose a geometry-aware 4D transition network to realize a complex scene-level 4D transition based on the plan, which involves expressive geometrical object deformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Trans4D consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in generating 4D scenes with accurate and high-quality transitions, validating its effectiveness.

|**2024-10-09**|**Cheating Automatic LLM Benchmarks: Null Models Achieve High Win Rates**|Automatic LLM benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard-Auto, and MT-Bench, have become popular for evaluating language models due to their cost-effectiveness and scalability compared to human evaluation. Achieving high win rates on these benchmarks can significantly boost the promotional impact of newly released language models. This promotional benefit may motivate tricks, such as manipulating model output length or style to game win rates, even though several mechanisms have been developed to control length and disentangle style to reduce gameability. Nonetheless, we show that even a "null model" that always outputs a constant response (irrelevant to input instructions) can cheat automatic benchmarks and achieve top-ranked win rates: an 86.5% LC win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0; an 83.0 score on Arena-Hard-Auto; and a 9.55 score on MT-Bench. Moreover, the crafted cheating outputs are transferable because we assume that the instructions of these benchmarks (e.g., 805 samples of AlpacaEval 2.0) are private and cannot be accessed. While our experiments are primarily proof-of-concept, an adversary could use LLMs to generate more imperceptible cheating responses, unethically benefiting from high win rates and promotional impact. Our findings call for the development of anti-cheating mechanisms for reliable automatic benchmarks.

|**2024-10-07**|**Data Advisor: Dynamic Data Curation for Safety Alignment of Large Language Models**|Data is a crucial element in large language model (LLM) alignment. Recent studies have explored using LLMs for efficient data collection. However, LLM-generated data often suffers from quality issues, with underrepresented or absent aspects and low-quality datapoints. To address these problems, we propose Data Advisor, an enhanced LLM-based method for generating data that takes into account the characteristics of the desired dataset. Starting from a set of pre-defined principles in hand, Data Advisor monitors the status of the generated data, identifies weaknesses in the current dataset, and advises the next iteration of data generation accordingly. Data Advisor can be easily integrated into existing data generation methods to enhance data quality and coverage. Experiments on safety alignment of three representative LLMs (i.e., Mistral, Llama2, and Falcon) demonstrate the effectiveness of Data Advisor in enhancing model safety against various fine-grained safety issues without sacrificing model utility.|Fei Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05269)|null|

While natural language enables straightforward ways to represent under-specified, partially observable events, visual data does not facilitate analogous methods and, consequently, introduces unique challenges in event understanding. With the growing prevalence of vision-capable AI agents, these systems must be able to model events from collections of unstructured video data. To tackle robust event modeling in multimodal settings, we introduce a multimodal formulation for partially-defined events and cast the extraction of these events as a three-stage span retrieval task. We propose a corresponding benchmark for this task, MultiVENT-G, that consists of 14.5 hours of densely annotated current event videos and 1,168 text documents, containing 22.8K labeled event-centric entities. We propose a collection of LLM-driven approaches to the task of multimodal event analysis, and evaluate them on MultiVENT-G. Results illustrate the challenges that abstract event understanding poses and demonstrates promise in event-centric video-language systems.|Kate Sanders et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05267)|null|
|**2024-10-07**|**PrefixQuant: Static Quantization Beats Dynamic through Prefixed Outliers in LLMs**|Quantization is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) by enhancing memory efficiency and inference speed. Existing methods for activation quantization mainly address channel-wise outliers, often neglecting token-wise outliers, leading to reliance on costly per-token dynamic quantization. To address this, we introduce PrefixQuant, a novel technique that isolates outlier tokens offline without re-training. Specifically, PrefixQuant identifies high-frequency outlier tokens and prefixes them in the KV cache, preventing the generation of outlier tokens during inference and simplifying quantization. To our knowledge, PrefixQuant is the first to enable efficient per-tensor static quantization to outperform expensive per-token dynamic quantization. For instance, in W4A4KV4 (4- bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) Llama-3-8B, PrefixQuant with per-tensor static quantization achieves a 7.43 WikiText2 perplexity and 71.08% average accuracy on 5 common-sense reasoning tasks, outperforming previous per-token dynamic quantization methods like QuaRot with 0.98 perplexity improvement and +5.98 points accuracy. Additionally, the inference speed of W4A4 quantized models using PrefixQuant is 1.60x to 2.81x faster than FP16 models and exceeds QuaRot models by 1.2x to 1.3x.

|**2024-10-07**|**TurtleBench: Evaluating Top Language Models via Real-World Yes/No Puzzles**|As the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) expands, the demand for reliable evaluations increases. Existing LLM evaluation benchmarks primarily rely on static datasets, making it challenging to assess model performance in dynamic interactions with users. Moreover, these benchmarks often depend on specific background knowledge, complicating the measurement of a model's logical reasoning capabilities. Other dynamic evaluation methods based on strong models or manual efforts may introduce biases and incur high costs and time demands, hindering large-scale application. To address these issues, we propose TurtleBench. TurtleBench collects real user guesses from our online Turtle Soup Puzzle platform that we developed. This approach allows for the relatively dynamic generation of evaluation datasets, mitigating the risk of model cheating while aligning assessments more closely with genuine user needs for reasoning capabilities, thus enhancing the reliability of evaluations. TurtleBench includes 1,532 user guesses along with the correctness of guesses after annotation. Using this dataset, we thoroughly evaluated nine of the most advanced LLMs available today. Notably, the OpenAI o1 series models did not achieve leading results in these evaluations. We propose several hypotheses for further research, such as "the latent reasoning of o1 utilizes trivial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques" and "increasing CoT length not only provides reasoning benefits but also incurs noise costs."|Qingchen Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05262)|**[link](https://github.com/mazzzystar/TurtleBench)**|
|**2024-10-07**|**Differential Transformer**|Transformer tends to overallocate attention to irrelevant context. In this work, we introduce Diff Transformer, which amplifies attention to the relevant context while canceling noise. Specifically, the differential attention mechanism calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. The subtraction cancels noise, promoting the emergence of sparse attention patterns. Experimental results on language modeling show that Diff Transformer outperforms Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and training tokens. More intriguingly, it offers notable advantages in practical applications, such as long-context modeling, key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation, in-context learning, and reduction of activation outliers. By being less distracted by irrelevant context, Diff Transformer can mitigate hallucination in question answering and text summarization. For in-context learning, Diff Transformer not only enhances accuracy but is also more robust to order permutation, which was considered as a chronic robustness issue. The results position Diff Transformer as a highly effective and promising architecture to advance large language models.|Tianzhu Ye et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05258)|null|
|**2024-10-07**|**GLEE: A Unified Framework and Benchmark for Language-based Economic Environments**|Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in economic and strategic interactions, where communication via natural language is often prevalent. This raises key questions: Do LLMs behave rationally? Can they mimic human behavior? Do they tend to reach an efficient and fair outcome? What is the role of natural language in the strategic interaction? How do characteristics of the economic environment influence these dynamics? These questions become crucial concerning the economic and societal implications of integrating LLM-based agents into real-world data-driven systems, such as online retail platforms and recommender systems. While the ML community has been exploring the potential of LLMs in such multi-agent setups, varying assumptions, design choices and evaluation criteria across studies make it difficult to draw robust and meaningful conclusions. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for standardizing research on two-player, sequential, language-based games. Inspired by the economic literature, we define three base families of games with consistent parameterization, degrees of freedom and economic measures to evaluate agents' performance (self-gain), as well as the game outcome (efficiency and fairness). We develop an open-source framework for interaction simulation and analysis, and utilize it to collect a dataset of LLM vs. LLM interactions across numerous game configurations and an additional dataset of human vs. LLM interactions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate how our framework and dataset can be used to: (i) compare the behavior of LLM-based agents to human players in various economic contexts; (ii) evaluate agents in both individual and collective performance measures; and (iii) quantify the effect of the economic characteristics of the environments on the behavior of agents.|Eilam Shapira et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05254)|**[link](https://github.com/eilamshapira/GLEE)**|
|**2024-10-07**|**Causal Micro-Narratives**|We present a novel approach to classify causal micro-narratives from text. These narratives are sentence-level explanations of the cause(s) and/or effect(s) of a target subject. The approach requires only a subject-specific ontology of causes and effects, and we demonstrate it with an application to inflation narratives. Using a human-annotated dataset spanning historical and contemporary US news articles for training, we evaluate several large language models (LLMs) on this multi-label classification task. The best-performing model--a fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B--achieves F1 scores of 0.87 on narrative detection and 0.71 on narrative classification. Comprehensive error analysis reveals challenges arising from linguistic ambiguity and highlights how model errors often mirror human annotator disagreements. This research establishes a framework for extracting causal micro-narratives from real-world data, with wide-ranging applications to social science research.|Mourad Heddaya et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05252)|null|
|**2024-10-07**|**SFTMix: Elevating Language Model Instruction Tuning with Mixup Recipe**|To induce desired behaviors in large language models (LLMs) for interaction-driven tasks, the instruction-tuning stage typically trains LLMs on instruction-response pairs using the next-token prediction (NTP) loss. Previous work aiming to improve instruction-tuning performance often emphasizes the need for higher-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, which typically involves expensive data filtering with proprietary LLMs or labor-intensive data generation by human annotators. However, these approaches do not fully leverage the datasets' intrinsic properties, resulting in high computational and labor costs, thereby limiting scalability and performance gains. In this paper, we propose SFTMix, a novel recipe that elevates instruction-tuning performance beyond the conventional NTP paradigm, without the need for well-curated datasets. Observing that LLMs exhibit uneven confidence across the semantic representation space, we argue that examples with different confidence levels should play distinct roles during the instruction-tuning process. Based on this insight, SFTMix leverages training dynamics to identify examples with varying confidence levels, then applies a Mixup-based regularization to mitigate overfitting on confident examples while propagating supervision signals to improve learning on relatively unconfident ones. This approach enables SFTMix to significantly outperform NTP across a wide range of instruction-following and healthcare domain-specific SFT tasks, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse LLM families and scalability to datasets of any size. Comprehensive ablation studies further verify the robustness of SFTMix's design choices, underscoring its versatility in consistently enhancing performance across different LLMs and datasets in broader natural language processing applications.|Yuxin Xiao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05248)|null|
|**2024-10-07**|**Navigating the Digital World as Humans Do: Universal Visual Grounding for GUI Agents**|Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are transforming the capabilities of graphical user interface (GUI) agents, facilitating their transition from controlled simulations to complex, real-world applications across various platforms. However, the effectiveness of these agents hinges on the robustness of their grounding capability. Current GUI agents predominantly utilize text-based representations such as HTML or accessibility trees, which, despite their utility, often introduce noise, incompleteness, and increased computational overhead. In this paper, we advocate a human-like embodiment for GUI agents that perceive the environment entirely visually and directly take pixel-level operations on the GUI. The key is visual grounding models that can accurately map diverse referring expressions of GUI elements to their coordinates on the GUI across different platforms. We show that a simple recipe, which includes web-based synthetic data and slight adaptation of the LLaVA architecture, is surprisingly effective for training such visual grounding models. We collect the largest dataset for GUI visual grounding so far, containing 10M GUI elements and their referring expressions over 1.3M screenshots, and use it to train UGround, a strong universal visual grounding model for GUI agents. Empirical results on six benchmarks spanning three categories (grounding, offline agent, and online agent) show that 1) UGround substantially outperforms existing visual grounding models for GUI agents, by up to 20% absolute, and 2) agents with UGround outperform state-of-the-art agents, despite the fact that existing agents use additional text-based input while ours only uses visual perception. These results provide strong support for the feasibility and promises of GUI agents that navigate the digital world as humans do.|Boyu Gou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05243)|null|

The GSM8K benchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on grade-school-level questions. While the performance of LLMs on GSM8K has significantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear whether their mathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions about the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, we conduct a large-scale study on several SOTA open and closed models. To overcome the limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved benchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a diverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations, providing key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning capabilities of models.Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question. Specifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and show that their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases. We hypothesize that this decline is because current LLMs cannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from their training data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question causes significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art models, even though the clause doesn't contribute to the reasoning chain needed for the final answer. Overall, our work offers a more nuanced understanding of LLMs' capabilities and limitations in mathematical reasoning.|Iman Mirzadeh et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05229)|null|
|**2024-10-04**|**Enhance Reasoning by Learning from Mistakes: Peer-Review Knowledge Distillation from Multiple Large Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited complex reasoning abilities by generating question rationales and demonstrated exceptional performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, these reasoning capabilities generally emerge in models with tens of billions of parameters, creating significant computational challenges for real-world deployment. Recent research has concentrated on improving open-source smaller models through knowledge distillation (KD) from commercial LLMs. Nevertheless, most of these studies rely solely on the responses from one single LLM as the gold rationale for training. In this paper, we introduce a novel Mistake-Aware Peer-Review Distillation (MAPD) approach: 1) Instead of merely obtaining gold rationales from teachers, our method asks teachers to identify and explain the student's mistakes, providing customized instruction learning data. 2) We design a simulated peer-review process between teacher LLMs, which selects only the generated rationales above the acceptance threshold. This reduces the chance of teachers guessing correctly with flawed rationale, improving instructional data quality. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.|Zhuochun Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03663)|null|

However, their unethical applications, such as disseminating disinformation, have become a growing concern. Although recent works have proposed a number of LLM detection methods, their robustness and reliability remain unclear. In this paper, we present RAFT: a grammar error-free black-box attack against existing LLM detectors. In contrast to previous attacks for language models, our method exploits the transferability of LLM embeddings at the word-level while preserving the original text quality. We leverage an auxiliary embedding to greedily select candidate words to perturb against the target detector. Experiments reveal that our attack effectively compromises all detectors in the study across various domains by up to 99%, and are transferable across source models. Manual human evaluation studies show our attacks are realistic and indistinguishable from original human-written text. We also show that examples generated by RAFT can be used to train adversarially robust detectors. Our work shows that current LLM detectors are not adversarially robust, underscoring the urgent need for more resilient detection mechanisms.|James Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03658)|null|

Simulation-trained policies also face scalability issues as many sim-to-real methods focus on a single task. To address these challenges, this work proposes GenSim2, a scalable framework that leverages coding LLMs with multi-modal and reasoning capabilities for complex and realistic simulation task creation, including long-horizon tasks with articulated objects. To automatically generate demonstration data for these tasks at scale, we propose planning and RL solvers that generalize within object categories. The pipeline can generate data for up to 100 articulated tasks with 200 objects and reduce the required human efforts. To utilize such data, we propose an effective multi-task language-conditioned policy architecture, dubbed proprioceptive point-cloud transformer (PPT), that learns from the generated demonstrations and exhibits strong sim-to-real zero-shot transfer. Combining the proposed pipeline and the policy architecture, we show a promising usage of GenSim2 that the generated data can be used for zero-shot transfer or co-train with real-world collected data, which enhances the policy performance by 20% compared with training exclusively on limited real data.|Pu Hua et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03645)|null|
|**2024-10-04**|**Aligning LLMs with Individual Preferences via Interaction**|As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly advanced capabilities, aligning their behaviors with human values and preferences becomes crucial for their wide adoption. While previous research focuses on general alignment to principles such as helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty, the need to account for individual and diverse preferences has been largely overlooked, potentially undermining customized human experiences. To address this gap, we train LLMs that can ''interact to align'', essentially cultivating the meta-skill of LLMs to implicitly infer the unspoken personalized preferences of the current user through multi-turn conversations, and then dynamically align their following behaviors and responses to these inferred preferences. Our approach involves establishing a diverse pool of 3,310 distinct user personas by initially creating seed examples, which are then expanded through iterative self-generation and filtering. Guided by distinct user personas, we leverage multi-LLM collaboration to develop a multi-turn preference dataset containing 3K+ multi-turn conversations in tree structures. Finally, we apply supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs using this dataset. For evaluation, we establish the ALOE (ALign With CustOmized PrEferences) benchmark, consisting of 100 carefully selected examples and well-designed metrics to measure the customized alignment performance during conversations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enabling dynamic, personalized alignment via interaction.|Shujin Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03642)|**[link](https://github.com/shujinwu-0814/aloe)**|

There are a number of lightweight LLMs (e.g., Gemini Nano, LLAMA2 7B) that can run locally on smartphones, providing users with greater control over their personal data. As a rapidly emerging application, we are concerned about their performance on commercial-off-the-shelf mobile devices. To fully understand the current landscape of LLM deployment on mobile platforms, we conduct a comprehensive measurement study on mobile devices. We evaluate both metrics that affect user experience, including token throughput, latency, and battery consumption, as well as factors critical to developers, such as resource utilization, DVFS strategies, and inference engines. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis of how these hardware capabilities and system dynamics affect on-device LLM performance, which may help developers identify and address bottlenecks for mobile LLM applications. We also provide comprehensive comparisons across the mobile system-on-chips (SoCs) from major vendors, highlighting their performance differences in handling LLM workloads.

|**2024-10-04**|**TICKing All the Boxes: Generated Checklists Improve LLM Evaluation and Generation**|Given the widespread adoption and usage of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to have flexible and interpretable evaluations of their instruction-following ability. Preference judgments between model outputs have become the de facto evaluation standard, despite distilling complex, multi-faceted preferences into a single ranking. Furthermore, as human annotation is slow and costly, LLMs are increasingly used to make these judgments, at the expense of reliability and interpretability. In this work, we propose TICK (Targeted Instruct-evaluation with ChecKlists), a fully automated, interpretable evaluation protocol that structures evaluations with LLM-generated, instruction-specific checklists. We first show that, given an instruction, LLMs can reliably produce high-quality, tailored evaluation checklists that decompose the instruction into a series of YES/NO questions. Each question asks whether a candidate response meets a specific requirement of the instruction. We demonstrate that using TICK leads to a significant increase (46.4% $\to$ 52.2%) in the frequency of exact agreements between LLM judgements and human preferences, as compared to having an LLM directly score an output. We then show that STICK (Self-TICK) can be used to improve generation quality across multiple benchmarks via self-refinement and Best-of-N selection. STICK self-refinement on LiveBench reasoning tasks leads to an absolute gain of $+$7.8%, whilst Best-of-N selection with STICK attains $+$6.3% absolute improvement on the real-world instruction dataset, WildBench. In light of this, structured, multi-faceted self-improvement is shown to be a promising way to further advance LLM capabilities. Finally, by providing LLM-generated checklists to human evaluators tasked with directly scoring LLM responses to WildBench instructions, we notably increase inter-annotator agreement (0.194 $\to$ 0.256).|Jonathan Cook et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03608)|null|

While existing watermarking detection techniques primarily focus on classifying entire documents as watermarked or not, they often neglect the common scenario of identifying individual watermark segments within longer, mixed-source documents. Drawing inspiration from plagiarism detection systems, we propose two novel methods for partial watermark detection. First, we develop a geometry cover detection framework aimed at determining whether there is a watermark segment in long text. Second, we introduce an adaptive online learning algorithm to pinpoint the precise location of watermark segments within the text. Evaluated on three popular watermarking techniques (KGW-Watermark, Unigram-Watermark, and Gumbel-Watermark), our approach achieves high accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Moreover, our framework is adaptable to other watermarking techniques, offering new insights for precise watermark detection.|Xuandong Zhao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03600)|null|

However, existing research primarily focuses on improving performance, lacking a comprehensive framework to explain and understand the fundamental factors behind CoT's success. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel perspective grounded in the Hopfieldian view of cognition in cognitive neuroscience. We establish a connection between CoT reasoning and key cognitive elements such as stimuli, actions, neural populations, and representation spaces. From our view, we can understand the reasoning process as the movement between these representation spaces. Building on this insight, we develop a method for localizing reasoning errors in the response of CoTs. Moreover, we propose the Representation-of-Thought (RoT) framework, which leverages the robustness of low-dimensional representation spaces to enhance the robustness of the reasoning process in CoTs. Experimental results demonstrate that RoT improves the robustness and interpretability of CoT reasoning while offering fine-grained control over the reasoning process.|Lijie Hu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03595)|null|

To address the aforementioned challenge, we follow a common cognitive process - when one's initial memory of critical on-sight details fades, it is intuitive to look at them a second time to seek a factual and accurate answer. Therefore, we introduce Memory-space Visual Retracing (MemVR), a novel hallucination mitigation paradigm that without the need for external knowledge retrieval or additional fine-tuning. In particular, we treat visual prompts as supplementary evidence to be reinjected into MLLMs via Feed Forward Network (FFN) as key-value memory, when the model is uncertain or even amnesic about question-relevant visual memories. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that MemVR significantly mitigates hallucination issues across various MLLMs and excels in general benchmarks without incurring added time overhead, thus emphasizing its potential for widespread applicability.|Xin Zou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03577)|null|

Although current image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods are generally effective, they tend to face two challenges: \textbf{1)} black-box nature with unknown detection principle, \textbf{2)} limited generalization across diverse tampering methods (e.g., Photoshop, DeepFake, AIGC-Editing). To address these issues, we propose the explainable IFDL task and design FakeShield, a multi-modal framework capable of evaluating image authenticity, generating tampered region masks, and providing a judgment basis based on pixel-level and image-level tampering clues. Additionally, we leverage GPT-4o to enhance existing IFDL datasets, creating the Multi-Modal Tamper Description dataSet (MMTD-Set) for training FakeShield's tampering analysis capabilities. Meanwhile, we incorporate a Domain Tag-guided Explainable Forgery Detection Module (DTE-FDM) and a Multi-modal Forgery Localization Module (MFLM) to address various types of tamper detection interpretation and achieve forgery localization guided by detailed textual descriptions.

Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in generating coherent and long sequences of tokens in the domain of natural language processing, while the exploration of autoregressive LLMs for video generation is limited to generating short videos of several seconds. In this work, we conduct a deep analysis of the challenges that prevent autoregressive LLM-based video generators from generating long videos. Based on the observations and analysis, we propose Loong, a new autoregressive LLM-based video generator that can generate minute-long videos.

This requires the development of new application-specific filtering of web-scale data. Filtering with a high-performance, general-purpose LLM such as GPT-4o can be highly effective, but this is extremely expensive at web-scale. This paper proposes SIEVE, a lightweight alternative that matches GPT-4o accuracy at a fraction of the cost. SIEVE can perform up to 500 filtering operations for the cost of one GPT-4o filtering call. The key to SIEVE is a seamless integration of GPT-4o and lightweight T5 models, using active learning to fine-tune T5 in the background with a small number of calls to GPT-4o. Once trained, it performs as well as GPT-4o at a tiny fraction of the cost. We experimentally validate SIEVE on the OpenWebText dataset, using five highly customized filter tasks targeting high quality and domain-specific content. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in curating large, high-quality datasets for language model training at a substantially lower cost (1%) than existing techniques. To further validate SIEVE, experiments show that SIEVE and GPT-4o achieve similar accuracy, with human evaluators preferring SIEVE's filtering results to those of GPT-4o.|Jifan Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02755)|null|
|**2024-10-03**|**Training Language Models on Synthetic Edit Sequences Improves Code Synthesis**|Software engineers mainly write code by editing existing programs. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) autoregressively synthesize programs in a single pass. One explanation for this is the scarcity of open-sourced edit data. While high-quality instruction data for code synthesis is already scarce, high-quality edit data is even scarcer. To fill this gap, we develop a synthetic data generation algorithm called LintSeq. This algorithm refactors existing code into a sequence of code edits by using a linter to procedurally sample across the error-free insertions that can be used to sequentially write programs. It outputs edit sequences as text strings consisting of consecutive program diffs. To test LintSeq, we use it to refactor a dataset of instruction + program pairs into instruction + program-diff-sequence tuples. Then, we instruction finetune a series of smaller LLMs ranging from 2.6B to 14B parameters on both the re-factored and original versions of this dataset, comparing zero-shot performance on code synthesis benchmarks. We show that during repeated sampling, edit sequence finetuned models produce more diverse programs than baselines. This results in better inference-time scaling for benchmark coverage as a function of samples, i.e. the fraction of problems "pass@k" solved by any attempt given "k" tries. For example, on HumanEval pass@50, small LLMs finetuned on synthetic edit sequences are competitive with GPT-4 and outperform models finetuned on the baseline dataset by +20% (+/-3%) in absolute score. Finally, we also pretrain our own tiny LMs for code understanding. We show that finetuning tiny models on synthetic code edits results in state-of-the-art code synthesis for the on-device model class. Our 150M parameter edit sequence LM matches or outperforms code models with twice as many parameters, both with and without repeated sampling, including Codex and AlphaCode.|Ulyana Piterbarg et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02749)|null|

However, crafting effective prompts that guide LLMs to generate summaries with the appropriate level of detail and writing style remains a challenge. In this paper, we explore the use of salient information extracted from the source document to enhance summarization prompts. We show that adding keyphrases in prompts can improve ROUGE F1 and recall, making the generated summaries more similar to the reference and more complete. The number of keyphrases can control the precision-recall trade-off. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that incorporating phrase-level salient information is superior to word- or sentence-level. However, the impact on hallucination is not universally positive across LLMs. To conduct this analysis, we introduce Keyphrase Signal Extractor (CriSPO), a lightweight model that can be finetuned to extract salient keyphrases. By using CriSPO, we achieve consistent ROUGE improvements across datasets and open-weight and proprietary LLMs without any LLM customization. Our findings provide insights into leveraging salient information in building prompt-based summarization systems.|Han He et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02748)|null|
|**2024-10-03**|**Contrastive Localized Language-Image Pre-Training**|Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has been a celebrated method for training vision encoders to generate image/text representations facilitating various applications. Recently, CLIP has been widely adopted as the vision backbone of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to connect image inputs for language interactions. The success of CLIP as a vision-language foundation model relies on aligning web-crawled noisy text annotations at image levels. Nevertheless, such criteria may become insufficient for downstream tasks in need of fine-grained vision representations, especially when region-level understanding is demanding for MLLMs. In this paper, we improve the localization capability of CLIP with several advances. We propose a pre-training method called Contrastive Localized Language-Image Pre-training (CLOC) by complementing CLIP with region-text contrastive loss and modules. We formulate a new concept, promptable embeddings, of which the encoder produces image embeddings easy to transform into region representations given spatial hints. To support large-scale pre-training, we design a visually-enriched and spatially-localized captioning framework to effectively generate region-text pseudo-labels at scale. By scaling up to billions of annotated images, CLOC enables high-quality regional embeddings for image region recognition and retrieval tasks, and can be a drop-in replacement of CLIP to enhance MLLMs, especially on referring and grounding tasks.|Hong-You Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02746)|null|
|**2024-10-03**|**Neutral residues: revisiting adapters for model extension**|We address the problem of extending a pretrained large language model to a new domain that was not seen at training time, like adding a language for which the original model has seen no or little training data. Popular solutions like fine-tuning or low-rank adaptation are successful at domain adaptation, but formally they do not add any extra capacity and degrade the performance in the original domain.   Our paper analyzes this extension problem under three angles: data, architecture and training procedure, which are advantageously considered jointly. In particular, we improve adapters and make it possible to learn an entire new language while ensuring that the output of the neural network is almost unchanged in the original domain. For this purpose, we modify the new residual blocks in a way that leads each new residual block to output near-zeros in the original domain.   This solution of neutral residues, which borrows architectural components from mixture of experts, is effective: with only 20% extra learnable weights compared to an original model trained on English, we get results that are significantly better than concurrent approaches (fine-tuning, low-rank or vanilla adapters) in terms of the trade-off between learning a new language and not forgetting English.|Franck Signe Talla et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02744)|null|
|**2024-10-03**|**MA-RLHF: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Macro Actions**|Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated effectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, token-level RLHF suffers from the credit assignment problem over long sequences, where delayed rewards make it challenging for the model to discern which actions contributed to successful outcomes. This hinders learning efficiency and slows convergence. In this paper, we propose MA-RLHF, a simple yet effective RLHF framework that incorporates macro actions -- sequences of tokens or higher-level language constructs -- into the learning process. By operating at this higher level of abstraction, our approach reduces the temporal distance between actions and rewards, facilitating faster and more accurate credit assignment. This results in more stable policy gradient estimates and enhances learning efficiency within each episode, all without increasing computational complexity during training or inference. We validate our approach through extensive experiments across various model sizes and tasks, including text summarization, dialogue generation, question answering, and program synthesis. Our method achieves substantial performance improvements over standard RLHF, with performance gains of up to 30% in text summarization and code generation, 18% in dialogue, and 8% in question answering tasks. Notably, our approach reaches parity with vanilla RLHF 1.7x to 2x faster in terms of training time and continues to outperform it with further training. We will make our code and data publicly available at https://github.com/ernie-research/MA-RLHF .|Yekun Chai et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02743)|null|
|**2024-10-03**|**Grounding Large Language Models In Embodied Environment With Imperfect World Models**|Despite a widespread success in various applications, large language models (LLMs) often stumble when tackling basic physical reasoning or executing robotics tasks, due to a lack of direct experience with the physical nuances of the real world. To address these issues, we propose a Grounding Large language model with Imperfect world MOdel (GLIMO), which utilizes proxy world models such as simulators to collect and synthesize trining data. GLIMO incorporates an LLM agent-based data generator to automatically create high-quality and diverse instruction datasets. The generator includes an iterative self-refining module for temporally consistent experience sampling, a diverse set of question-answering instruction seeds, and a retrieval-augmented generation module for reflecting on prior experiences. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach improve the performance of strong open-source LLMs like LLaMA-3 with a performance boost of 2.04 $\times$, 1.54 $\times$, and 1.82 $\times$ across three different benchmarks, respectively. The performance is able to compete with or surpass their larger counterparts such as GPT-4.|Haolan Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02742)|null|

|**2024-10-02**|**Locret: Enhancing Eviction in Long-Context LLM Inference with Trained Retaining Heads**|Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in supporting long-context comprehension and processing tasks. However, scaling the generation inference of LLMs to such long contexts incurs significant additional computation load, and demands a substantial GPU memory footprint to maintain the key-value (KV) cache of transformer-based LLMs. Existing KV cache compression methods, such as quantization, face memory bottlenecks as context length increases, while static-sized caches, such as eviction, suffer from inefficient policies. These limitations restrict deployment on consumer-grade devices like a single Nvidia 4090 GPU. To overcome this, we propose Locret, a framework for long-context LLM inference that introduces retaining heads to evaluate the causal importance of KV cache units, allowing for more accurate eviction within a fixed cache size. Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen backbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT datasets. During inference, we evict low-importance cache units along with a chunked prefill pattern, significantly reducing peak GPU memory usage. We conduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate Locret, where the experimental results show that Locret outperforms the recent competitive approaches, including InfLLM, Quantization, SirLLM, and MInference, in terms of memory efficiency and the quality of generated contents -- Locret achieves over a 20x and 8x KV cache compression ratio compared to the full KV cache for Phi-3-mini-128K and Llama-3.1-8B-instruct. Additionally, Locret can be combined with other methods, such as quantization and token merging. To our knowledge, Locret is the first framework capable of deploying Llama-3.1-8B or similar models on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, enabling 128K long-context inference without compromising generation quality, and requiring little additional system optimizations.|Yuxiang Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01805)|**[link](https://github.com/huangyuxiang03/Locret)**|
|**2024-10-02**|**Efficient $1$-bit tensor approximations**|We present a spatially efficient decomposition of matrices and arbitrary-order tensors as linear combinations of tensor products of $\{-1, 1\}$-valued vectors. For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, $$A - R_w = S_w C_w T_w^\top = \sum_{j=1}^w c_j \cdot \mathbf{s}_j \mathbf{t}_j^\top$$ is a {\it $w$-width signed cut decomposition of $A$}. Here $C_w = "diag"(\mathbf{c}_w)$ for some $\mathbf{c}_w \in \mathbb{R}^w,$ and $S_w, T_w$, and the vectors $\mathbf{s}_j, \mathbf{t}_j$ are $\{-1, 1\}$-valued. To store $(S_w, T_w, C_w)$, we may pack $w \cdot (m + n)$ bits, and require only $w$ floating point numbers. As a function of $w$, $\|R_w\|_F$ exhibits exponential decay when applied to #f32 matrices with i.i.d. $\mathcal N (0, 1)$ entries. Choosing $w$ so that $(S_w, T_w, C_w)$ has the same memory footprint as a \textit{f16} or \textit{bf16} matrix, the relative error is comparable. Our algorithm yields efficient signed cut decompositions in $20$ lines of pseudocode. It reflects a simple modification from a celebrated 1999 paper [1] of Frieze and Kannan. As a first application, we approximate the weight matrices in the open \textit{Mistral-7B-v0.1} Large Language Model to a $50\%$ spatial compression. Remarkably, all $226$ remainder matrices have a relative error $<6\%$ and the expanded model closely matches \textit{Mistral-7B-v0.1} on the {\it huggingface} leaderboard [2]. Benchmark performance degrades slowly as we reduce the spatial compression from $50\%$ to $25\%$ . We optimize our open source \textit{rust} implementation [3] with \textit{simd} instructions on \textit{avx2} and \textit{avx512} architectures.

Conventionally, data-driven approaches are utilized for this task, yet the high dimensional nature of genotype data makes the analysis and prediction difficult. Motivated by the extensive knowledge encoded in pre-trained LLMs and their success in processing complex biomedical concepts, we set to examine the ability of LLMs in feature selection and engineering for tabular genotype data, with a novel knowledge-driven framework. We develop FREEFORM, Free-flow Reasoning and Ensembling for Enhanced Feature Output and Robust Modeling, designed with chain-of-thought and ensembling principles, to select and engineer features with the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs. Evaluated on two distinct genotype-phenotype datasets, genetic ancestry and hereditary hearing loss, we find this framework outperforms several data-driven methods, particularly on low-shot regimes.

|**2024-10-02**|**When a language model is optimized for reasoning, does it still show embers of autoregression? An analysis of OpenAI o1**|In "Embers of Autoregression" (McCoy et al., 2023), we showed that several large language models (LLMs) have some important limitations that are attributable to their origins in next-word prediction. Here we investigate whether these issues persist with o1, a new system from OpenAI that differs from previous LLMs in that it is optimized for reasoning. We find that o1 substantially outperforms previous LLMs in many cases, with particularly large improvements on rare variants of common tasks (e.g., forming acronyms from the second letter of each word in a list, rather than the first letter). Despite these quantitative improvements, however, o1 still displays the same qualitative trends that we observed in previous systems. Specifically, o1 - like previous LLMs - is sensitive to the probability of examples and tasks, performing better and requiring fewer "thinking tokens" in high-probability settings than in low-probability ones. These results show that optimizing a language model for reasoning can mitigate but might not fully overcome the language model's probability sensitivity.|R.

The code of nature, hidden in diverse genomes since the very beginning of life's evolution, holds immense potential for impacting humans and ecosystems through genome modeling. Recent breakthroughs in GFMs, such as Evo, have attracted significant investment and attention to genomic modeling, as they address long-standing challenges and transform in-silico genomic studies into automated, reliable, and efficient paradigms. In the context of this flourishing era of consecutive technological revolutions in genomics, GFM studies face two major challenges: the lack of GFM benchmarking tools and the absence of open-source software for diverse genomics. These challenges hinder the rapid evolution of GFMs and their wide application in tasks such as understanding and synthesizing genomes, problems that have persisted for decades. To address these challenges, we introduce GFMBench, a framework dedicated to GFM-oriented benchmarking. GFMBench standardizes benchmark suites and automates benchmarking for a wide range of open-source GFMs. It integrates millions of genomic sequences across hundreds of genomic tasks from four large-scale benchmarks, democratizing GFMs for a wide range of in-silico genomic applications.

Open-RAG uniquely trains the model to navigate challenging distractors that appear relevant but are misleading. As a result, Open-RAG leverages latent learning, dynamically selecting relevant experts and integrating external knowledge effectively for more accurate and contextually relevant responses. In addition, we propose a hybrid adaptive retrieval method to determine retrieval necessity and balance the trade-off between performance gain and inference speed. Experimental results show that the Llama2-7B-based Open-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs and RAG models such as ChatGPT, Self-RAG, and Command R+ in various knowledge-intensive tasks.

However, challenges arise when processing transcripts of spoken speech describing complex scenarios. These transcripts often contain ungrammatical or incomplete sentences, repetitions, hedging, and vagueness. For example, during a company's earnings call, an executive might project a positive revenue outlook to reassure investors, despite significant uncertainty regarding future earnings. It is crucial for LLMs to incorporate this uncertainty systematically when making decisions. In this paper, we introduce DeFine, a new framework that constructs probabilistic factor profiles from complex scenarios. DeFine then integrates these profiles with analogical reasoning, leveraging insights from similar past experiences to guide LLMs in making critical decisions in novel situations. Our framework separates the tasks of quantifying uncertainty in complex scenarios and incorporating it into LLM decision-making. This approach is particularly useful in fields such as medical consultations, negotiations, and political debates, where making decisions under uncertainty is vital.|Yebowen Hu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01772)|null|
|**2024-10-03**|**Quantifying Generalization Complexity for Large Language Models**|While large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in understanding complex queries and performing sophisticated tasks, their generalization abilities are often deeply entangled with memorization, necessitating more precise evaluation. To address this challenge, we introduce Scylla, a dynamic evaluation framework that quantitatively measures the generalization abilities of LLMs. Scylla disentangles generalization from memorization via assessing model performance on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data through 20 tasks across 5 levels of complexity. Through extensive experiments, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship between task complexity and the performance gap between ID and OOD data, which we term the generalization valley. Specifically, this phenomenon reveals a critical threshold - referred to as critical complexity - where reliance on non-generalizable behavior peaks, indicating the upper bound of LLMs' generalization capabilities. As model size increases, the critical complexity shifts toward higher levels of task complexity, suggesting that larger models can handle more complex reasoning tasks before over-relying on memorization. Leveraging Scylla and the concept of critical complexity, we benchmark 28LLMs including both open-sourced models such as LLaMA and Qwen families, and close-sourced models like Claude and GPT, providing a more robust evaluation and establishing a clearer understanding of LLMs' generalization capabilities.|Zhenting Qi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01769)|null|

The problem presents significant challenges due to the need for comprehensive knowledge of temporal and hierarchical task structures, as well as strong capabilities in reasoning and planning. To achieve this, prior work typically relies on extensive training on the target dataset, which often results in significant dataset bias and a lack of generalization to unseen tasks. In this work, we introduce VidAssist, an integrated framework designed for zero/few-shot goal-oriented planning in instructional videos. VidAssist leverages large language models (LLMs) as both the knowledge base and the assessment tool for generating and evaluating action plans, thus overcoming the challenges of acquiring procedural knowledge from small-scale, low-diversity datasets. Moreover, VidAssist employs a breadth-first search algorithm for optimal plan generation, in which a composite of value functions designed for goal-oriented planning is utilized to assess the predicted actions at each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VidAssist offers a unified framework for different goal-oriented planning setups, e.g., visual planning for assistance (VPA) and procedural planning (PP), and achieves remarkable performance in zero-shot and few-shot setups. Specifically, our few-shot model outperforms the prior fully supervised state-of-the-art method by +7.7% in VPA and +4.81% PP task on the COIN dataset while predicting 4 future actions.

Recent large language models (LLMs) based approaches have shown promising results and revolutionized code generation task. Despite the promising performance, LLMs often generate contents with hallucinations, especially for the code generation scenario requiring the handling of complex contextual dependencies in practical development process. Although previous study has analyzed hallucinations in LLM-powered code generation, the study is limited to standalone function generation. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to study the phenomena, mechanism, and mitigation of LLM hallucinations within more practical and complex development contexts in repository-level generation scenario. First, we manually examine the code generation results from six mainstream LLMs to establish a hallucination taxonomy of LLM-generated code. Next, we elaborate on the phenomenon of hallucinations, analyze their distribution across different models. We then analyze causes of hallucinations and identify four potential factors contributing to hallucinations. Finally, we propose an RAG-based mitigation method, which demonstrates consistent effectiveness in all studied LLMs. The replication package including code, data, and experimental results is available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/LLMCodingHallucination|Ziyao Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20550)|null|

This paper presents a novel framework that combines an automated data extraction using language models, and an uncertainty-informed prediction model to fill data gaps and improve prediction confidence. First, we have utilized and compared two approaches to automatically extract relevant data from a corpus of scientific literature on solvents used in perovskite synthesis: smaller bidirectional language models like BERT and ELMo are used for their repeatability and deterministic outputs, while autoregressive large language model (LLM) such as GPT-3.5 is used to leverage its larger training corpus and better response generation. Our novel 'prompting and verification' technique integrated with an LLM aims at targeted extraction and refinement, thereby reducing hallucination and improving the quality of the extracted data using the LLM. Next, the extracted data is fed into our pre-trained multi-task binary classification deep learning to predict the ED nature of extracted solvents. We have used a Shannon entropy-based uncertainty quantification utilizing the class probabilities obtained from the classification model to quantify uncertainty and identify data gaps in our predictions. This approach leads to the curation of a structured dataset for solvents used in perovskite synthesis and their uncertainty-informed virtual toxicity assessment. Additionally, chord diagrams have been used to visualize solvent interactions and prioritize those with potential hazards, revealing that 70% of the solvent interactions were primarily associated with two specific perovskites.|Arpan Mukherjee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20512)|null|
|**2024-09-30**|**COLLAGE: Collaborative Human-Agent Interaction Generation using Hierarchical Latent Diffusion and Language Models**|We propose a novel framework COLLAGE for generating collaborative agent-object-agent interactions by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and hierarchical motion-specific vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs). Our model addresses the lack of rich datasets in this domain by incorporating the knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs to guide a generative diffusion model. The hierarchical VQ-VAE architecture captures different motion-specific characteristics at multiple levels of abstraction, avoiding redundant concepts and enabling efficient multi-resolution representation. We introduce a diffusion model that operates in the latent space and incorporates LLM-generated motion planning cues to guide the denoising process, resulting in prompt-specific motion generation with greater control and diversity. Experimental results on the CORE-4D, and InterHuman datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating realistic and diverse collaborative human-object-human interactions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling complex interactions in various domains, such as robotics, graphics and computer vision.|Divyanshu Daiya et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20502)|null|
|**2024-10-01**|**Instance-adaptive Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought Prompting**|Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting emerges as a simple and effective strategy for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in real-world reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, the efficacy of a singular, task-level prompt uniformly applied across the whole of instances is inherently limited since one prompt cannot be a good partner for all, a more appropriate approach should consider the interaction between the prompt and each instance meticulously. This work introduces an instance-adaptive prompting algorithm as an alternative zero-shot CoT reasoning scheme by adaptively differentiating good and bad prompts. Concretely, we first employ analysis on LLMs through the lens of information flow to detect the mechanism under zero-shot CoT reasoning, in which we discover that information flows from question to prompt and question to rationale jointly influence the reasoning results most. We notice that a better zero-shot CoT reasoning needs the prompt to obtain semantic information from the question then the rationale aggregates sufficient information from the question directly and via the prompt indirectly. On the contrary, lacking any of those would probably lead to a bad one. Stem from that, we further propose an instance-adaptive prompting strategy (IAP) for zero-shot CoT reasoning. Experiments conducted with LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and Qwen on math, logic, and commonsense reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K, MMLU, Causal Judgement) obtain consistent improvement, demonstrating that the instance-adaptive zero-shot CoT prompting performs better than other task-level methods with some curated prompts or sophisticated procedures, showing the significance of our findings in the zero-shot CoT reasoning mechanism.|Xiaosong Yuan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20441)|null|

However, the inherent gap between user queries and relevant documents hinders precise matching. Motivated by our conical distribution hypothesis, which posits that potential queries and documents form a cone-like structure in the embedding space, we introduce QAEncoder, a training-free approach to bridge this gap. Specifically, QAEncoder estimates the expectation of potential queries in the embedding space as a robust surrogate for the document embedding, and attaches document fingerprints to effectively distinguish these embeddings. Extensive experiments on fourteen embedding models across six languages and eight datasets validate QAEncoder's alignment capability, which offers a plug-and-play solution that seamlessly integrates with existing RAG architectures and training-based methods.|Zhengren Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20434)|null|

Investigating and Improving Language Models' Ability to Resist Requests for Misinformation**|Background: Large language models (LLMs) are trained to follow directions, but this introduces a vulnerability to blindly comply with user requests even if they generate wrong information. In medicine, this could accelerate the generation of misinformation that impacts human well-being.   Objectives/Methods: We analyzed compliance to requests to generate misleading content about medications in settings where models know the request is illogical. We investigated whether in-context directions and instruction-tuning of LLMs to prioritize logical reasoning over compliance reduced misinformation risk.   Results: While all frontier LLMs complied with misinformation requests, both prompt-based and parameter-based approaches can improve the detection of logic flaws in requests and prevent the dissemination of medical misinformation.   Conclusion: Shifting LLMs to prioritize logic over compliance could reduce risks of exploitation for medical misinformation.|Shan Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20385)|null|
|**2024-09-27**|**LML: Language Model Learning a Dataset for Data-Augmented Prediction**|This paper introduces a new approach to using Large Language Models (LLMs) for classification tasks, which are typically handled using Machine Learning (ML) models. Unlike ML models that rely heavily on data cleaning and feature engineering, this method streamlines the process using LLMs. This paper proposes a new concept called "Language Model Learning (LML)" powered by a new method called "Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP)". The classification is performed by LLMs using a method similar to humans manually exploring and understanding the data and deciding classifications using data as a reference. Training data is summarized and evaluated to determine the features that lead to the classification of each label the most. In the process of DAP, the system uses the data summary to automatically create a query, which is used to retrieve relevant rows from the dataset. A classification is generated by the LLM using data summary and relevant rows, ensuring satisfactory accuracy even with complex data. Usage of data summary and similar data in DAP ensures context-aware decision-making. The proposed method uses the words "Act as an Explainable Machine Learning Model" in the prompt to enhance the interpretability of the predictions by allowing users to review the logic behind each prediction. In some test cases, the system scored an accuracy above 90%, proving the effectiveness of the system and its potential to outperform conventional ML models in various scenarios.

|**2024-09-27**|**Ruler: A Model-Agnostic Method to Control Generated Length for Large Language Models**|The instruction-following ability of large language models enables humans to interact with AI agents in a natural way. However, when required to generate responses of a specific length, large language models often struggle to meet users' needs due to their inherent difficulty in accurately perceiving numerical constraints. To explore the ability of large language models to control the length of generated responses, we propose the Target Length Generation Task (TLG) and design two metrics, Precise Match (PM) and Flexible Match (FM) to evaluate the model's performance in adhering to specified response lengths. Furthermore, we introduce a novel, model-agnostic approach called Ruler, which employs Meta Length Tokens (MLTs) to enhance the instruction-following ability of large language models under length-constrained instructions. Specifically, Ruler equips LLMs with the ability to generate responses of a specified length based on length constraints within the instructions. Moreover, Ruler can automatically generate appropriate MLT when length constraints are not explicitly provided, demonstrating excellent versatility and generalization. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of Ruler across different LLMs on Target Length Generation Task, e.g., at All Level 27.97 average gain on PM, 29.57 average gain on FM. In addition, we conduct extensive ablation experiments to further substantiate the efficacy and generalization of Ruler.

|**2024-09-27**|**From Seconds to Hours: Reviewing MultiModal Large Language Models on Comprehensive Long Video Understanding**|The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual encoders has recently shown promising performance in visual understanding tasks, leveraging their inherent capability to comprehend and generate human-like text for visual reasoning. Given the diverse nature of visual data, MultiModal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) exhibit variations in model designing and training for understanding images, short videos, and long videos. Our paper focuses on the substantial differences and unique challenges posed by long video understanding compared to static image and short video understanding. Unlike static images, short videos encompass sequential frames with both spatial and within-event temporal information, while long videos consist of multiple events with between-event and long-term temporal information. In this survey, we aim to trace and summarize the advancements of MM-LLMs from image understanding to long video understanding. We review the differences among various visual understanding tasks and highlight the challenges in long video understanding, including more fine-grained spatiotemporal details, dynamic events, and long-term dependencies. We then provide a detailed summary of the advancements in MM-LLMs in terms of model design and training methodologies for understanding long videos. Finally, we compare the performance of existing MM-LLMs on video understanding benchmarks of various lengths and discuss potential future directions for MM-LLMs in long video understanding.|Heqing Zou et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18938)|null|
|**2024-09-27**|**AIPatient: Simulating Patients with EHRs and LLM Powered Agentic Workflow**|Simulated patient systems play a crucial role in modern medical education and research, providing safe, integrative learning environments and enabling clinical decision-making simulations. Large Language Models (LLM) could advance simulated patient systems by replicating medical conditions and patient-doctor interactions with high fidelity and low cost. However, ensuring the effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems remains a challenge, as they require a large, diverse, and precise patient knowledgebase, along with a robust and stable knowledge diffusion to users. Here, we developed AIPatient, an advanced simulated patient system with AIPatient Knowledge Graph (AIPatient KG) as the input and the Reasoning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Reasoning RAG) agentic workflow as the generation backbone. AIPatient KG samples data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database, producing a clinically diverse and relevant cohort of 1,495 patients with high knowledgebase validity (F1 0.89). Reasoning RAG leverages six LLM powered agents spanning tasks including retrieval, KG query generation, abstraction, checker, rewrite, and summarization. This agentic framework reaches an overall accuracy of 94.15% in EHR-based medical Question Answering (QA), outperforming benchmarks that use either no agent or only partial agent integration. Our system also presents high readability (median Flesch Reading Ease 77.23; median Flesch Kincaid Grade 5.6), robustness (ANOVA F-value 0.6126, p<0.1), and stability (ANOVA F-value 0.782, p<0.1).

Directed graphs called fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) offer a powerful tool for encoding causal mental models, but extracting high-integrity FCMs from text is challenging. This study presents an approach using large language models (LLMs) to automate FCM extraction. We introduce novel graph-based similarity measures and evaluate them by correlating their outputs with human judgments through the Elo rating system. Results show positive correlations with human evaluations, but even the best-performing measure exhibits limitations in capturing FCM nuances. Fine-tuning LLMs improves performance, but existing measures still fall short. This study highlights the need for soft similarity measures tailored to FCM extraction, advancing collective intelligence modeling with NLP.|Maryam Berijanian et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18911)|**[link](https://github.com/kuldeep7688/soft-measures-causal-intelligence)**|
|**2024-09-27**|**IDGen: Item Discrimination Induced Prompt Generation for LLM Evaluation**|As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow increasingly adept at managing complex tasks, the evaluation set must keep pace with these advancements to ensure it remains sufficiently discriminative. Item Discrimination (ID) theory, which is widely used in educational assessment, measures the ability of individual test items to differentiate between high and low performers. Inspired by this theory, we propose an ID-induced prompt synthesis framework for evaluating LLMs to ensure the evaluation set can continually update and refine according to model abilities. Our data synthesis framework prioritizes both breadth and specificity. It can generate prompts that comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs while revealing meaningful performance differences between models, allowing for effective discrimination of their relative strengths and weaknesses across various tasks and domains. To produce high-quality data, we incorporate a self-correct mechanism into our generalization framework, and develop two models to predict prompt discrimination and difficulty score to facilitate our data synthesis framework, contributing valuable tools to evaluation data synthesis research. We apply our generated data to evaluate five SOTA models. Our data achieves an average score of 51.92, accompanied by a variance of 10.06. By contrast, previous works (i.e., SELF-INSTRUCT and WizardLM) obtain an average score exceeding 67, with a variance below 3.2. The results demonstrate that the data generated by our framework is more challenging and discriminative compared to previous works. We will release a dataset of over 3,000 carefully crafted prompts to facilitate evaluation research of LLMs.|Fan Lin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18892)|null|
|**2024-09-27**|**Emu3: Next-Token Prediction is All You Need**|While next-token prediction is considered a promising path towards artificial general intelligence, it has struggled to excel in multimodal tasks, which are still dominated by diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) and compositional approaches (e.g., CLIP combined with LLMs). In this paper, we introduce Emu3, a new suite of state-of-the-art multimodal models trained solely with next-token prediction. By tokenizing images, text, and videos into a discrete space, we train a single transformer from scratch on a mixture of multimodal sequences. Emu3 outperforms several well-established task-specific models in both generation and perception tasks, surpassing flagship models such as SDXL and LLaVA-1.6, while eliminating the need for diffusion or compositional architectures. Emu3 is also capable of generating high-fidelity video via predicting the next token in a video sequence. We simplify complex multimodal model designs by converging on a singular focus: tokens, unlocking great potential for scaling both during training and inference. Our results demonstrate that next-token prediction is a promising path towards building general multimodal intelligence beyond language. We open-source key techniques and models to support further research in this direction.|Xinlong Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18869)|null|
|**2024-09-27**|**Predicting and analyzing memorization within fine-tuned Large Language Models**|Large Language Models have received significant attention due to their abilities to solve a wide range of complex tasks. However these models memorize a significant proportion of their training data, posing a serious threat when disclosed at inference time. To mitigate this unintended memorization, it is crucial to understand what elements are memorized and why. Most existing works provide a posteriori explanations, which has a limited interest in practice. To address this gap, we propose a new approach based on sliced mutual information to detect memorized samples a priori, in a classification setting. It is efficient from the early stages of training, and is readily adaptable to practical scenarios. Our method is supported by new theoretical results that we demonstrate, and requires a low computational budget. We obtain strong empirical results, paving the way for systematic inspection and protection of these vulnerable samples before memorization happens.|Jérémie Dentan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18858)|null|

To mitigate this selection bias problem, previous solutions utilized debiasing methods to adjust the model's input and/or output. Our work, in contrast, investigates the model's internal representation of the selection bias. Specifically, we introduce a novel debiasing approach, Bias Node Pruning (BNP), which eliminates the linear layer parameters that contribute to the bias. Furthermore, we present Auxiliary Option Injection (AOI), a simple yet effective input modification technique for debiasing, which is compatible even with black-box LLMs. To provide a more systematic evaluation of selection bias, we review existing metrics and introduce Choice Kullback-Leibler Divergence (CKLD), which addresses the insensitivity of the commonly used metrics to label imbalance. Experiments show that our methods are robust and adaptable across various datasets when applied to three LLMs.|Hyeong Kyu Choi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18857)|null|

EgoLM exploits rich contexts for the disambiguation of egomotion tracking and understanding, which are ill-posed under single modality conditions. To facilitate the versatile and multi-modal framework, our key insight is to model the joint distribution of egocentric motions and natural languages using large language models (LLM). Multi-modal sensor inputs are encoded and projected to the joint latent space of language models, and used to prompt motion generation or text generation for egomotion tracking or understanding, respectively. Extensive experiments on large-scale multi-modal human motion dataset validate the effectiveness of EgoLM as a generalist model for universal egocentric learning.|Fangzhou Hong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18127)|null|

Due to these restrictions, existing CLIP applications in medical imaging focus mainly on modalities like chest X-rays that have abundant image-report data available, leaving many other important modalities under-explored. Here, we propose the first adaptation of the full CLIP model to mammography, which presents significant challenges due to labeled data scarcity, high-resolution images with small regions of interest, and data imbalance. We first develop a specialized supervision framework for mammography that leverages its multi-view nature. Furthermore, we design a symmetric local alignment module to better focus on detailed features in high-resolution images. Lastly, we incorporate a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for large language models pre-trained with medical knowledge to address data limitations. Our multi-view and multi-scale alignment (MaMA) method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for three different tasks on two large real-world mammography datasets, EMBED and RSNA-Mammo, with only 52% model size compared with the largest baseline.|Yuexi Du et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18119)|null|

To verify the significance of these models, a number of benchmarks have been proposed to diagnose their capabilities in different scenarios. However, existing benchmarks merely evaluate models through video-level question-answering, lacking fine-grained event-level assessment and task diversity. To fill this gap, we introduce E.T. Bench (Event-Level & Time-Sensitive Video Understanding Benchmark), a large-scale and high-quality benchmark for open-ended event-level video understanding. Categorized within a 3-level task taxonomy, E.T. Bench encompasses 7.3K samples under 12 tasks with 7K videos (251.4h total length) under 8 domains, providing comprehensive evaluations. We extensively evaluated 8 Image-LLMs and 12 Video-LLMs on our benchmark, and the results reveal that state-of-the-art models for coarse-level (video-level) understanding struggle to solve our fine-grained tasks, e.g., grounding event-of-interests within videos, largely due to the short video context length, improper time representations, and lack of multi-event training data. Focusing on these issues, we further propose a strong baseline model, E.T. Chat, together with an instruction-tuning dataset E.T. Instruct 164K tailored for fine-grained event-level understanding.

User interface icons are essential for navigation and interaction and often lack meaningful alt-text, creating barriers to effective use. Traditional deep learning approaches for generating alt-text require extensive datasets and struggle with the diversity and imbalance of icon types. More recent Vision Language Models (VLMs) require complete UI screens, which can be impractical during the iterative phases of app development. To address these issues, we introduce a novel method using Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously generate informative alt-text for mobile UI icons with partial UI data. By incorporating icon context, that include class, resource ID, bounds, OCR-detected text, and contextual information from parent and sibling nodes, we fine-tune an off-the-shelf LLM on a small dataset of approximately 1.4k icons, yielding IconDesc. In an empirical evaluation and a user study IconDesc demonstrates significant improvements in generating relevant alt-text. This ability makes IconDesc an invaluable tool for developers, aiding in the rapid iteration and enhancement of UI accessibility.|Sabrina Haque et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18060)|null|
|**2024-09-26**|**DualAD: Dual-Layer Planning for Reasoning in Autonomous Driving**|We present a novel autonomous driving framework, DualAD, designed to imitate human reasoning during driving. DualAD comprises two layers: a rule-based motion planner at the bottom layer that handles routine driving tasks requiring minimal reasoning, and an upper layer featuring a rule-based text encoder that converts driving scenarios from absolute states into text description. This text is then processed by a large language model (LLM) to make driving decisions. The upper layer intervenes in the bottom layer's decisions when potential danger is detected, mimicking human reasoning in critical situations. Closed-loop experiments demonstrate that DualAD, using a zero-shot pre-trained model, significantly outperforms rule-based motion planners that lack reasoning abilities. Our experiments also highlight the effectiveness of the text encoder, which considerably enhances the model's scenario understanding. Additionally, the integrated DualAD model improves with stronger LLMs, indicating the framework's potential for further enhancement.

However, empowering Large Language Models to perceive and generate images, texts, and speeches end-to-end with publicly available data remains challenging in the open-source community. Existing vision-language models rely on external tools for the speech processing, while speech-language models still suffer from limited or even without vision-understanding abilities. To address this gap, we propose EMOVA (EMotionally Omni-present Voice Assistant), to enable Large Language Models with end-to-end speech capabilities while maintaining the leading vision-language performance. With a semantic-acoustic disentangled speech tokenizer, we notice surprisingly that omni-modal alignment can further enhance vision-language and speech abilities compared with the corresponding bi-modal aligned counterparts. Moreover, a lightweight style module is proposed for flexible speech style controls (e.g., emotions and pitches). For the first time, EMOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the vision-language and speech benchmarks, and meanwhile, supporting omni-modal spoken dialogue with vivid emotions.|Kai Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18042)|null|
|**2024-09-26**|**Compositional Hardness of Code in Large Language Models -- A Probabilistic Perspective**|A common practice in large language model (LLM) usage for complex analytical tasks such as code generation, is to sample a solution for the entire task within the model's context window. Previous works have shown that subtask decomposition within the model's context (chain of thought), is beneficial for solving such tasks. In this work, we point a limitation of LLMs' ability to perform several sub-tasks within the same context window - an in-context hardness of composition, pointing to an advantage for distributing a decomposed problem in a multi-agent system of LLMs. The hardness of composition is quantified by a generation complexity metric, i.e., the number of LLM generations required to sample at least one correct solution. We find a gap between the generation complexity of solving a compositional problem within the same context relative to distributing it among multiple agents, that increases exponentially with the solution's length. We prove our results theoretically and demonstrate them empirically.|Yotam Wolf et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18028)|null|

Unlearning methods aim at completely removing hazardous capabilities from models and make them inaccessible to adversaries. This work challenges the fundamental differences between unlearning and traditional safety post-training from an adversarial perspective. We demonstrate that existing jailbreak methods, previously reported as ineffective against unlearning, can be successful when applied carefully. Furthermore, we develop a variety of adaptive methods that recover most supposedly unlearned capabilities. For instance, we show that finetuning on 10 unrelated examples or removing specific directions in the activation space can recover most hazardous capabilities for models edited with RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method.

While modern VLMs perform well on a number of standard image classification and image-text matching tasks, they still struggle with a number of crucial vision-language (VL) reasoning abilities such as counting and spatial reasoning. Moreover, while they might be very brittle to small variations in instructions and/or evaluation protocols, existing benchmarks fail to evaluate their robustness (or rather the lack of it). In order to couple challenging VL scenarios with comprehensive robustness evaluation, we introduce DARE, Diverse Visual Question Answering with Robustness Evaluation, a carefully created and curated multiple-choice VQA benchmark. DARE evaluates VLM performance on five diverse categories and includes four robustness-oriented evaluations based on the variations of: prompts, the subsets of answer options, the output format and the number of correct answers. Among a spectrum of other findings, we report that state-of-the-art VLMs still struggle with questions in most categories and are unable to consistently deliver their peak performance across the tested robustness evaluations. The worst case performance across the subsets of options is up to 34% below the performance in the standard case. The robustness of the open-source VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6 and Idefics2 cannot match the closed-source models such as GPT-4 and Gemini, but even the latter remain very brittle to different variations.|Hannah Sterz et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18023)|null|

To address this issue, a new paradigm named Online Long-context Processing (OLP) is proposed when we process a document of unlimited length, which typically occurs in the information reception and organization of diverse streaming media such as automated news reporting, live e-commerce, and viral short videos. Moreover, a dilemma was often encountered when we tried to select the most suitable LLM from a large number of LLMs amidst explosive growth aiming for outstanding performance, affordable prices, and short response delays. In view of this, we also develop Role Reinforcement Learning (Role-RL) to automatically deploy different LLMs in their respective roles within the OLP pipeline according to their actual performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on our OLP-MINI dataset and it is found that OLP with Role-RL framework achieves OLP benchmark with an average recall rate of 93.2% and the LLM cost saved by 79.4%.

|**2024-09-25**|**Attention Prompting on Image for Large Vision-Language Models**|Compared with Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can also accept images as input, thus showcasing more interesting emergent capabilities and demonstrating impressive performance on various vision-language tasks. Motivated by text prompting in LLMs, visual prompting has been explored to enhance LVLMs' capabilities of perceiving visual information. However, previous visual prompting techniques solely process visual inputs without considering text queries, limiting the models' ability to follow text instructions to complete tasks. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose a new prompting technique named Attention Prompting on Image, which just simply overlays a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image and effectively enhances LVLM on various tasks. Specifically, we generate an attention heatmap for the input image dependent on the text query with an auxiliary model like CLIP. Then the heatmap simply multiplies the pixel values of the original image to obtain the actual input image for the LVLM. Extensive experiments on various vison-language benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our technique.

|**2024-09-25**|**FineZip : Pushing the Limits of Large Language Models for Practical Lossless Text Compression**|While the language modeling objective has been shown to be deeply connected with compression, it is surprising that modern LLMs are not employed in practical text compression systems. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of neural network and transformer-based compression techniques to answer this question. We compare traditional text compression systems with neural network and LLM-based text compression methods. Although LLM-based systems significantly outperform conventional compression methods, they are highly impractical. Specifically, LLMZip, a recent text compression system using Llama3-8B requires 9.5 days to compress just 10 MB of text, although with huge improvements in compression ratios. To overcome this, we present FineZip - a novel LLM-based text compression system that combines ideas of online memorization and dynamic context to reduce the compression time immensely. FineZip can compress the above corpus in approximately 4 hours compared to 9.5 days, a 54 times improvement over LLMZip and comparable performance. FineZip outperforms traditional algorithmic compression methods with a large margin, improving compression ratios by approximately 50\%. With this work, we take the first step towards making lossless text compression with LLMs a reality. While FineZip presents a significant step in that direction, LLMs are still not a viable solution for large-scale text compression. We hope our work paves the way for future research and innovation to solve this problem.|Fazal Mittu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17141)|**[link](https://github.com/fazalmittu/finezip)**|

However, these agents often suffer from high latency and low reliability due to the extensive sequential UI interactions. To address this issue, we propose AXIS, a novel LLM-based agents framework prioritize actions through application programming interfaces (APIs) over UI actions. This framework also facilitates the creation and expansion of APIs through automated exploration of applications. Our experiments on Office Word demonstrate that AXIS reduces task completion time by 65%-70% and cognitive workload by 38%-53%, while maintaining accuracy of 97%-98% compare to humans. Our work contributes to a new human-agent-computer interaction (HACI) framework and a fresh UI design principle for application providers in the era of LLMs. It also explores the possibility of turning every applications into agents, paving the way towards an agent-centric operating system (Agent OS).|Junting Lu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17140)|null|
|**2024-09-25**|**Programming Every Example: Lifting Pre-training Data Quality like Experts at Scale**|Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts to craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous rules developed to date. However, these rules lack the flexibility to address the unique characteristics of individual example effectively. Meanwhile, applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts. In this paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B parameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to those of human experts. We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel framework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to refine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as string normalization, for each individual example at scale. Experimental results show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either original data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2% across various downstream benchmarks. Its effectiveness spans various model sizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, and FineWeb. Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable to models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens. Further analysis highlights that ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for efficient LLM pre-training.We are open-sourcing ProX with >100B corpus, models, and sharing all training and implementation details for reproducible research and future innovation.

These regions emerge during training and become more defined as training progresses or model size increases. The regions appear to be much larger than previously studied polytopes. Our analysis suggests that these stable regions align with semantic distinctions, where similar prompts cluster within regions, and activations from the same region lead to similar next token predictions.

|**2024-09-25**|**Accumulator-Aware Post-Training Quantization**|Several recent studies have investigated low-precision accumulation, reporting improvements in throughput, power, and area across various platforms. However, the accompanying proposals have only considered the quantization-aware training (QAT) paradigm, in which models are fine-tuned or trained from scratch with quantization in the loop. As models continue to grow in size, QAT techniques become increasingly more expensive, which has motivated the recent surge in post-training quantization (PTQ) research. To the best of our knowledge, ours marks the first formal study of accumulator-aware quantization in the PTQ setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce AXE, a practical framework of accumulator-aware extensions designed to endow overflow avoidance guarantees to existing layer-wise PTQ algorithms. We theoretically motivate AXE and demonstrate its flexibility by implementing it on top of two state-of-the-art PTQ algorithms: GPFQ and OPTQ. We further generalize AXE to support multi-stage accumulation for the first time, opening the door for full datapath optimization and scaling to large language models (LLMs). We evaluate AXE across image classification and language generation models, and observe significant improvements in the trade-off between accumulator bit width and model accuracy over baseline methods.|Ian Colbert et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17092)|null|

However, attribution for long documents remains largely unexplored. Post-hoc attribution systems are designed to map answer text back to the source document, yet the granularity of this mapping has not been addressed. Furthermore, a critical question arises: What precisely should be attributed, with an emphasis on identifying the information units within an answer that necessitate grounding? In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel approach to the factual decomposition of generated answers for attribution, employing template-based in-context learning. To accomplish this, we utilize the question and integrate negative sampling during few-shot in-context learning for decomposition. This approach enhances the semantic understanding of both abstractive and extractive answers. We examine the impact of answer decomposition by providing a thorough examination of various attribution approaches, ranging from retrieval-based techniques to LLM-based attributors.|Pritika Ramu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17073)|null|
|**2024-09-25**|**VPTQ: Extreme Low-bit Vector Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models**|Scaling model size significantly challenges the deployment and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recent research has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit (even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs, and decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due to numerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weight quantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit. Recent research on Vector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremely low-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookup tables.   In this paper, we introduce Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ) for extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs. We use Second-Order Optimization to formulate the LLM VQ problem and guide our quantization algorithm design by solving the optimization. We further refine the weights using Channel-Independent Second-Order Optimization for a granular VQ. In addition, by decomposing the optimization problem, we propose a brief and effective codebook initialization algorithm. We also extend VPTQ to support residual and outlier quantization, which enhances model accuracy and further compresses the model. Our experimental results show that VPTQ reduces model quantization perplexity by $0.01$-$0.34$ on LLaMA-2, $0.38$-$0.68$ on Mistral-7B, $4.41$-$7.34$ on LLaMA-3 over SOTA at 2-bit, with an average accuracy improvement of $0.79$-$1.5\%$ on LLaMA-2, $1\%$ on Mistral-7B, $11$-$22\%$ on LLaMA-3 on QA tasks on average. We only utilize $10.4$-$18.6\%$ of the quantization algorithm execution time, resulting in a $1.6$-$1.8\times$ increase in inference throughput compared to SOTA.|Yifei Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17066)|**[link](https://github.com/microsoft/vptq)**|
|**2024-09-25**|**Using LLM for Real-Time Transcription and Summarization of Doctor-Patient Interactions into ePuskesmas in Indonesia**|One of the key issues contributing to inefficiency in Puskesmas is the time-consuming nature of doctor-patient interactions. Doctors need to conduct thorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition, providing treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medical records. In regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds, doctors often have to ask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process. While diagnosing is essential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI to improve time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable early diagnosis and intervention. This paper proposes a solution using a localized large language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarize doctor-patient conversations. We utilize the Whisper model for transcription and GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format. This system is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension, allowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking. By leveraging this solution for real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, doctors can improve the turnaround time for patient care while enhancing the quality of records, which become more detailed and insightful for future visits. This innovation addresses challenges like overcrowded facilities and the administrative burden on healthcare providers in Indonesia. We believe this solution will help doctors save time, provide better care, and produce more accurate medical records, representing a significant step toward modernizing healthcare and ensuring patients receive timely, high-quality care, even in resource-constrained settings.|Azmul Asmar Irfan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17054)|null|

What Matters and What Does Not**|The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.|Francesco Verdini et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17044)|null|

However, the inherent heterogeneity of these teams presents significant challenges in initial task allocation (ITA), which involves assigning the most suitable tasks to each team member based on their individual capabilities before task execution. While current learning-based methods have shown promising results, they are often computationally expensive to train, and lack the flexibility to incorporate user preferences in multi-objective optimization and adapt to last-minute changes in real-world dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose REBEL, an LLM-based ITA framework that integrates rule-based and experience-enhanced learning. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation, REBEL dynamically retrieves relevant rules and past experiences, enhancing reasoning efficiency. Additionally, REBEL can complement pre-trained RL-based ITA policies, improving situational awareness and overall team performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach across various settings.

However, their widespread use raises concerns, particularly around the potential for LLMs to spread persuasive, humanlike misinformation at scale, which could significantly influence public opinion. This study examines these risks, focusing on LLMs ability to propagate misinformation as factual. To investigate this, we built the LLM Echo Chamber, a controlled digital environment simulating social media chatrooms, where misinformation often spreads. Echo chambers, where individuals only interact with like minded people, further entrench beliefs. By studying malicious bots spreading misinformation in this environment, we can better understand this phenomenon. We reviewed current LLMs, explored misinformation risks, and applied sota finetuning techniques. Using Microsoft phi2 model, finetuned with our custom dataset, we generated harmful content to create the Echo Chamber. This setup, evaluated by GPT4 for persuasiveness and harmfulness, sheds light on the ethical concerns surrounding LLMs and emphasizes the need for stronger safeguards against misinformation.|Tony Ma et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16241)|**[link](https://github.com/iamtonymwt/echo_chamber)**|

This paper examines the integration of LLMs within existing systems, emphasising the enhancement of conversational user interfaces (UIs) and their capabilities for data extraction by producing more accurate SPARQL queries without the requirement for model retraining. Typically, conversational UI models necessitate retraining with the introduction of new datasets or updates, limiting their functionality as general-purpose extraction tools. Our approach addresses this limitation by incorporating LLMs into the conversational UI workflow, significantly enhancing their ability to comprehend and process user queries effectively. By leveraging the advanced natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, our method improves RDF entity extraction within web systems employing conventional chatbots. This integration facilitates a more nuanced and context-aware interaction model, critical for handling the complex query patterns often encountered in RDF datasets and Linked Open Data (LOD) endpoints. The evaluation of this methodology shows a marked enhancement in system expressivity and the accuracy of responses to user queries, indicating a promising direction for future research in this area. This investigation not only underscores the versatility of LLMs in enhancing existing information systems but also sets the stage for further explorations into their potential applications within more specialised domains of web information systems.|Omar Mussa et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16220)|null|

However, detecting stationary crowds remains challenging due to several factors such as minimal movements (like breathing or casual fidgets), which can be easily treated as noise clusters during data collection and consequently filtered in the following processing procedures. Additionally, the uneven distribution of signal power due to signal power attenuation and interferences resulting from external reflectors or absorbers further complicates accurate detection. To address these challenges and enable stationary crowd detection across various application scenarios requiring specialized domain adaption, we introduce LLMCount, the first system to harness the capabilities of large-language models (LLMs) to enhance crowd detection performance. By exploiting the decision-making capability of LLM, we can successfully compensate the signal power to acquire a uniform distribution and thereby achieve a detection with higher accuracy. To assess the system's performance, comprehensive evaluations are conducted under diversified scenarios like hall, meeting room, and cinema. The evaluation results show that our proposed approach reaches high detection accuracy with lower overall latency compared with previous methods.|Boyan Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16209)|null|

With the further enhancement of this transformation, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has elevated the intelligence levels of these platforms. However, current academic benchmarks provide limited guidance for real-world industry scenarios. This limitation arises because educational applications require more than mere test question responses. To bridge this gap, we introduce CJEval, a benchmark based on Chinese Junior High School Exam Evaluations. CJEval consists of 26,136 samples across four application-level educational tasks covering ten subjects. These samples include not only questions and answers but also detailed annotations such as question types, difficulty levels, knowledge concepts, and answer explanations.

However, we observe that long text generation capabilities are not well investigated. Therefore, we introduce the Hierarchical Long Text Generation Benchmark (HelloBench), a comprehensive, in-the-wild, and open-ended benchmark to evaluate LLMs' performance in generating long text. Based on Bloom's Taxonomy, HelloBench categorizes long text generation tasks into five subtasks: open-ended QA, summarization, chat, text completion, and heuristic text generation. Besides, we propose Hierarchical Long Text Evaluation (HelloEval), a human-aligned evaluation method that significantly reduces the time and effort required for human evaluation while maintaining a high correlation with human evaluation. We have conducted extensive experiments across around 30 mainstream LLMs and observed that the current LLMs lack long text generation capabilities. Specifically, first, regardless of whether the instructions include explicit or implicit length constraints, we observe that most LLMs cannot generate text that is longer than 4000 words. Second, we observe that while some LLMs can generate longer text, many issues exist (e.g., severe repetition and quality degradation). Third, to demonstrate the effectiveness of HelloEval, we compare HelloEval with traditional metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU, etc.) and LLM-as-a-Judge methods, which show that HelloEval has the highest correlation with human evaluation.

Assessing the risks of CPSs is increasingly difficult due to incomplete and outdated cybersecurity knowledge. This highlights the urgent need for better-informed risk assessments and mitigation strategies. While previous efforts have relied on rule-based natural language processing (NLP) tools to map vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and attack patterns, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a unique opportunity to enhance cyber-attack knowledge completion through improved reasoning, inference, and summarization capabilities. We apply embedding models to encapsulate information on attack patterns and adversarial techniques, generating mappings between them using vector embeddings. Additionally, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based approach that leverages pre-trained models to create structured mappings between different taxonomies of threat patterns. Further, we use a small hand-labeled dataset to compare the proposed RAG-based approach to a baseline standard binary classification model. Thus, the proposed approach provides a comprehensive framework to address the challenge of cyber-attack knowledge graph completion.|Braden K Webb et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16176)|null|

This modularity has sparked interest in combining multiple LoRAs to enhance LLM capabilities. However, existing methods for LoRA composition primarily focus on task-specific adaptations that require additional training, and current model merging techniques often fail to fully leverage LoRA's modular nature, leading to parameter interference and performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of disassembling and reassembling multiple LoRAs at a finer granularity, analogous to assembling LEGO blocks. We introduce the concept of Minimal Semantic Units (MSUs), where the parameters corresponding to each rank in LoRA function as independent units. These MSUs demonstrate permutation invariance and concatenation-summation equivalence properties, enabling flexible combinations to create new LoRAs. Building on these insights, we propose the LoRA-LEGO framework. This framework conducts rank-wise parameter clustering by grouping MSUs from different LoRAs into $k$ clusters. The centroid of each cluster serves as a representative MSU, enabling the assembly of a merged LoRA with an adjusted rank of $k$ . Additionally, we apply a dual reweighting strategy to optimize the scale of the merged LoRA. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in LoRA merging.|Ziyu Zhao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16167)|null|

However, existing studies on RAG seldom address the issue of predictive uncertainty, i.e., how likely it is that a RAG model's prediction is incorrect, resulting in uncontrollable risks in real-world applications. In this work, we emphasize the importance of risk control, ensuring that RAG models proactively refuse to answer questions with low confidence. Our research identifies two critical latent factors affecting RAG's confidence in its predictions: the quality of the retrieved results and the manner in which these results are utilized. To guide RAG models in assessing their own confidence based on these two latent factors, we develop a counterfactual prompting framework that induces the models to alter these factors and analyzes the effect on their answers. We also introduce a benchmarking procedure to collect answers with the option to abstain, facilitating a series of experiments. For evaluation, we introduce several risk-related metrics and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.|Lu Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16146)|null|

Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning**|Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications.|Zayne Sprague et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183)|null|

Due to the implementation challenges associated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation, utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several insights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of perplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods systematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm that exact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging.

|**2024-09-18**|**Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty**|Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking and decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate information that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result, end-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore supervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty. Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then fine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of uncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and supervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to well-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim answers.|Arslan Chaudhry et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180)|null|
|**2024-09-18**|**Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit Recommendation with Preference**|Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their "black box" and static nature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item visual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style and color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the open-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative examples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates a self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank, and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's ability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the proposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit generation.|Najmeh Forouzandehmehr et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150)|null|
|**2024-09-18**|**MAgICoRe: Multi-Agent, Iterative, Coarse-to-Fine Refinement for Reasoning**|Large Language Models' (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test-time aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can over-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding how many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard ones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error localization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores. Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on step-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure sufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5 and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of MAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by 4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent communication.|Justin Chih-Yao Chen et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147)|**[link](https://github.com/dinobby/magicore)**|

The method enhances motion diffusion models by leveraging additional knowledge obtained through an improved motion retrieval process. By effectively prompting large language models (LLMs), we address spelling errors and rephrasing issues in motion retrieval. Our approach utilizes a multi-part retrieval strategy to improve the generalizability of motion retrieval across the language space. We create diverse samples through the spatial composition of the retrieved motions. Furthermore, by utilizing low-level, part-specific motion information, we can construct motion samples for unseen text descriptions. Our experiments demonstrate that our framework can serve as a plug-and-play module, improving the performance of motion diffusion models.

|**2024-09-24**|**Takin: A Cohort of Superior Quality Zero-shot Speech Generation Models**|With the advent of the big data and large language model era, zero-shot personalized rapid customization has emerged as a significant trend. In this report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for audiobook production. These models are capable of zero-shot speech production, generating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a multi-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural speech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre and prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models.

The core innovation of the Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement throughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to inference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized to generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the post-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive sampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative evolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model, it's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct. (3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling, optimizing the model's performance.   Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math competition problems.|An Yang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12122)|null|

However, audio codecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and inference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we present the Low Frame-rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech language models to achieve high-quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps bitrate and 21.5 frames per second. We demonstrate that our novel codec can make the inference of LLM-based text-to-speech models around three times faster while improving intelligibility and producing quality comparable to previous models.|Edresson Casanova et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12117)|null|

This practice has inspired the development of Phidias, a novel generative model that uses diffusion for reference-augmented 3D generation. Given an image, our method leverages a retrieved or user-provided 3D reference model to guide the generation process, thereby enhancing the generation quality, generalization ability, and controllability. Our model integrates three key components: 1) meta-ControlNet that dynamically modulates the conditioning strength, 2) dynamic reference routing that mitigates misalignment between the input image and 3D reference, and 3) self-reference augmentations that enable self-supervised training with a progressive curriculum. Collectively, these designs result in a clear improvement over existing methods. Phidias establishes a unified framework for 3D generation using text, image, and 3D conditions with versatile applications.|Zhenwei Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11406)|null|

We address this gap by introducing seven synthetic datasets in dialects alongside Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), created using Machine Translation (MT) combined with human post-editing. We present AraDiCE, a benchmark for Arabic Dialect and Cultural Evaluation. We evaluate LLMs on dialect comprehension and generation, focusing specifically on low-resource Arabic dialects. Additionally, we introduce the first-ever fine-grained benchmark designed to evaluate cultural awareness across the Gulf, Egypt, and Levant regions, providing a novel dimension to LLM evaluation. Our findings demonstrate that while Arabic-specific models like Jais and AceGPT outperform multilingual models on dialectal tasks, significant challenges persist in dialect identification, generation, and translation. This work contributes ~45K post-edited samples, a cultural benchmark, and highlights the importance of tailored training to improve LLM performance in capturing the nuances of diverse Arabic dialects and cultural contexts. We will release the dialectal translation models and benchmarks curated in this study.|Basel Mousi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11404)|null|
|**2024-09-17**|**NVLM: Open Frontier-Class Multimodal LLMs**|We introduce NVLM 1.0, a family of frontier-class multimodal large language models (LLMs) that achieve state-of-the-art results on vision-language tasks, rivaling the leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-access models (e.g., Llama 3-V 405B and InternVL 2). Remarkably, NVLM 1.0 shows improved text-only performance over its LLM backbone after multimodal training. In terms of model design, we perform a comprehensive comparison between decoder-only multimodal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA) and cross-attention-based models (e.g., Flamingo). Based on the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, we propose a novel architecture that enhances both training efficiency and multimodal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a 1-D tile-tagging design for tile-based dynamic high-resolution images, which significantly boosts performance on multimodal reasoning and OCR-related tasks. Regarding training data, we meticulously curate and provide detailed information on our multimodal pretraining and supervised fine-tuning datasets. Our findings indicate that dataset quality and task diversity are more important than scale, even during the pretraining phase, across all architectures. Notably, we develop production-grade multimodality for the NVLM-1.0 models, enabling them to excel in vision-language tasks while maintaining and even improving text-only performance compared to their LLM backbones. To achieve this, we craft and integrate a high-quality text-only dataset into multimodal training, alongside a substantial amount of multimodal math and reasoning data, leading to enhanced math and coding capabilities across modalities. To advance research in the field, we are releasing the model weights and will open-source the code for the community: https://nvlm-project.github.io/.|Wenliang Dai et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11402)|null|
|**2024-09-17**|**LLM-Agent-UMF: LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework for Seamless Integration of Multi Active/Passive Core-Agents**|The integration of tools in LLM-based agents overcame the difficulties of standalone LLMs and traditional agents' limited capabilities. However, the conjunction of these technologies and the proposed enhancements in several state-of-the-art works followed a non-unified software architecture resulting in a lack of modularity. Indeed, they focused mainly on functionalities and overlooked the definition of the component's boundaries within the agent. This caused terminological and architectural ambiguities between researchers which we addressed in this paper by proposing a unified framework that establishes a clear foundation for LLM-based agents' development from both functional and software architectural perspectives.   Our framework, LLM-Agent-UMF (LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework), clearly distinguishes between the different components of an agent, setting LLMs, and tools apart from a newly introduced element: the core-agent, playing the role of the central coordinator of the agent which comprises five modules: planning, memory, profile, action, and security, the latter often neglected in previous works. Differences in the internal structure of core-agents led us to classify them into a taxonomy of passive and active types. Based on this, we proposed different multi-core agent architectures combining unique characteristics of various individual agents.   For evaluation purposes, we applied this framework to a selection of state-of-the-art agents, thereby demonstrating its alignment with their functionalities and clarifying the overlooked architectural aspects. Moreover, we thoroughly assessed four of our proposed architectures by integrating distinctive agents into hybrid active/passive core-agents' systems. This analysis provided clear insights into potential improvements and highlighted the challenges involved in the combination of specific agents.|Amine B.

Effective Zero-Shot Annotation of Focalization**|Focalization, the perspective through which narrative is presented, is encoded via a wide range of lexico-grammatical features and is subject to reader interpretation. Moreover, trained readers regularly disagree on interpretations, suggesting that this problem may be computationally intractable. In this paper, we provide experiments to test how well contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) perform when annotating literary texts for focalization mode. Despite the challenging nature of the task, LLMs show comparable performance to trained human annotators in our experiments. We provide a case study working with the novels of Stephen King to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for computational literary studies, illustrating how focalization can be studied at scale.|Rebecca M.

|**2024-09-17**|**Diversify and Conquer: Diversity-Centric Data Selection with Iterative Refinement**|Finetuning large language models on instruction data is crucial for enhancing pre-trained knowledge and improving instruction-following capabilities. As instruction datasets proliferate, selecting optimal data for effective training becomes increasingly important. This work addresses the question: How can we determine the optimal subset of data for effective training? While existing research often emphasizes local criteria like instance quality for subset selection, we argue that a global approach focused on data diversity is more critical. Our method employs k-means clustering to ensure the selected subset effectively represents the full dataset. We propose an iterative refinement method inspired by active learning techniques to resample instances from clusters, reassessing each cluster's importance and sampling weight in every training iteration. This approach reduces the effect of outliers and automatically filters out clusters containing low-quality data. Through extensive evaluation across natural language reasoning, general world knowledge, code and math reasoning tasks, and by fine-tuning models from various families, we observe consistent improvements, achieving a 7% increase over random selection and a 3.8% improvement over state-of-the-art sampling methods. Our work highlights the significance of diversity-first sampling when finetuning LLMs to enhance performance across a broad array of evaluation tasks.

|**2024-09-17**|**Towards Time Series Reasoning with LLMs**|Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled numerous advances in understanding and reasoning in domains like vision, but we have not yet seen this broad success for time-series. Although prior works on time-series MLLMs have shown promising performance in time-series forecasting, very few works show how an LLM could be used for time-series reasoning in natural language. We propose a novel multi-modal time-series LLM approach that learns generalizable information across various domains with powerful zero-shot performance. First, we train a lightweight time-series encoder on top of an LLM to directly extract time-series information. Then, we fine-tune our model with chain-of-thought augmented time-series tasks to encourage the model to generate reasoning paths. We show that our model learns a latent representation that reflects specific time-series features (e.g. slope, frequency), as well as outperforming GPT-4o on a set of zero-shot reasoning tasks on a variety of domains.|Winnie Chow et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11376)|null|

Nonetheless, the development of a robust deep-learning model for retinal disease diagnosis necessitates a substantial dataset for training. The capacity to generalize effectively on smaller datasets remains a persistent challenge. The scarcity of data presents a significant barrier to the practical implementation of scalable medical AI solutions. To address this issue, we've combined a wide range of data sources to improve performance and generalization to new data by giving it a deeper understanding of the data representation from multi-modal datasets and developed a self-supervised framework based on large language models (LLMs), SwinV2 to gain a deeper understanding of multi-modal dataset representations, enhancing the model's ability to extrapolate to new data for the detection of eye diseases using optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. We adopt a two-phase training methodology, self-supervised pre-training, and fine-tuning on a downstream supervised classifier. An ablation study conducted across three datasets employing various encoder backbones, without data fusion, with low data availability setting, and without self-supervised pre-training scenarios, highlights the robustness of our method. Our findings demonstrate consistent performance across these diverse conditions, showcasing superior generalization capabilities compared to the baseline model, ResNet-50.|Fatema-E- Jannat et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11375)|null|
|**2024-09-17**|**CoCA: Regaining Safety-awareness of Multimodal Large Language Models with Constitutional Calibration**|The deployment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated remarkable success in engaging in conversations involving visual inputs, thanks to the superior power of large language models (LLMs). Those MLLMs are typically built based on the LLMs, with an image encoder to process images into the token embedding space of the LLMs. However, the integration of visual modality has introduced a unique vulnerability: the MLLM becomes susceptible to malicious visual inputs and prone to generating sensitive or harmful responses, even though the LLM has been trained on textual dataset to align with human value. In this paper, we first raise the question: ``Do the MLLMs possess safety-awareness against malicious image inputs?". We find that after adding a principle that specifies the safety requirement into the input of the MLLM, the model's safety awareness becomes boosted. This phenomenon verifies the existence of MLLM's safety-awareness against image inputs, it is only weakened by the modality gap. We then introduce a simple yet effective technique termed CoCA, which amplifies the safety-awareness of the MLLM by calibrating its output distribution. Our proposed strategy helps the model reclaim its original safety awareness without losing its original capabilities. We verify the effectiveness of our approach on both multimodal safety and understanding benchmarks.|Jiahui Gao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11365)|null|

As these embedded AI applications are deployed globally, there is a growing concern that the AI models underlying these applications prioritize Western values. This paper investigates what happens when a Western-centric AI model provides writing suggestions to users from a different cultural background. We conducted a cross-cultural controlled experiment with 118 participants from India and the United States who completed culturally grounded writing tasks with and without AI suggestions. Our analysis reveals that AI provided greater efficiency gains for Americans compared to Indians. Moreover, AI suggestions led Indian participants to adopt Western writing styles, altering not just what is written but also how it is written. These findings show that Western-centric AI models homogenize writing toward Western norms, diminishing nuances that differentiate cultural expression.|Dhruv Agarwal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11360)|null|
|**2024-09-16**|**RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector Retrieval**|Transformer-based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important in various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention operation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to the extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse property of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off-the-shelf ANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for accurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity. RetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS-based attention, and addresses it via an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to queries and only access 1--3% of data, thus achieving a sub-linear time complexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of long-context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the model accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).|Di Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516)|null|
|**2024-09-16**|**Context-aware Code Segmentation for C-to-Rust Translation using Large Language Models**|There is strong motivation to translate C code into Rust code due to the continuing threat of memory safety vulnerabilities in existing C programs and the significant attention paid to Rust as an alternative to the C language. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating this translation by generating more natural and safer code than rule-based methods, previous studies have shown that LLM-generated Rust code often fails to compile, even for relatively small C programs, due to significant differences between the two languages and context window limitations. We propose an LLM-based translation scheme that improves the success rate of translating large-scale C code into compilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1) pre-processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with Rust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid exceeding the LLM's context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and repairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using context-supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step in achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further tested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding 4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable Rust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.|Momoko Shiraishi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506)|null|

Existing works often rely on local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive explanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a multilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called DIctionary Label Attention (\method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense embeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a dictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through human evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human understandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our automated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language models (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and summarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We represent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes through a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global understanding of the model's predictions while maintaining competitive performance and scalability without extensive human annotation.|John Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10504)|null|
|**2024-09-16**|**Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on Logic Puzzles**|Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded remarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few years. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning capabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this work, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as solving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to search over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then apply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the application of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in a cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases, multiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We observe that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn to solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly) when trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that training Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and without such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis to Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves $92.04 \%$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal representations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear probing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any given cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine implicit in the Transformer weights.|Kulin Shah et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502)|null|

These tasks span from extracting data and summarizing literature to generating content, predictive modeling, decision-making, and system controls. Moreover, Vision Large Models (VLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which represent the next generation of language models, a.k.a., XLMs, can combine and integrate many data modalities with the strength of language understanding, thus advancing several information-based systems, such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Indeed, by combining language communication with multimodal sensory inputs, e.g., panoramic images and LiDAR or radar data, accurate driving actions can be taken. In this context, we provide in this survey paper a comprehensive overview of the potential of XLMs towards achieving autonomous driving. Specifically, we review the relevant literature on ADS and XLMs, including their architectures, tools, and frameworks.

With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their language capabilities are becoming increasingly comparable to those of humans. But do LLMs have memory? Based on current performance, LLMs do appear to exhibit memory. So, what is the underlying mechanism of this memory? Previous research has lacked a deep exploration of LLMs' memory capabilities and the underlying theory. In this paper, we use Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) to explain the memory mechanism in LLMs. We also conduct experiments to verify the memory capabilities of various LLMs, proposing a new method to assess their abilities based on these memory ability. We argue that LLM memory operates like Schr\"odinger's memory, meaning that it only becomes observable when a specific memory is queried. We can only determine if the model retains a memory based on its output in response to the query; otherwise, it remains indeterminate. Finally, we expand on this concept by comparing the memory capabilities of the human brain and LLMs, highlighting the similarities and differences in their operational mechanisms.|Wei Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10482)|null|

Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but manually designing them can be effort-intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied in robotic task planning for generating action sequences, but their ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, We propose LLM as BT-planner, a novel framework to leverage LLMs for BT generation in robotic assembly task planning and execution. Four in-context learning methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference capabilities of LLMs to produce task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort and ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. We also evaluate the performance of fine-tuned, fewer-parameter LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in simulated and real-world settings show that our framework enhances LLMs' performance in BT generation, improving success rates in BT generation through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning.|Jicong Ao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10444)|null|

However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about unauthorized access to users' privacy-sensitive information, which could be further abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization. Our study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android third-party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain. It focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data exfiltration and behavior-policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing techniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158 widely-used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a large alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data exfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30% of the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data handling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them over-collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We revisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months. Our analysis demonstrates a persistent lack of improvement in these concerning trends. Based on our findings, we propose three actionable recommendations to mitigate the privacy leakage risks and enhance privacy protection for Android users.

We find that many studies combining LLMs with SE have employed the concept of agents either explicitly or implicitly. However, there is a lack of an in-depth survey to sort out the development context of existing works, analyze how existing works combine the LLM-based agent technologies to optimize various tasks, and clarify the framework of LLM-based agents in SE. In this paper, we conduct the first survey of the studies on combining LLM-based agents with SE and present a framework of LLM-based agents in SE which includes three key modules: perception, memory, and action. We also summarize the current challenges in combining the two fields and propose future opportunities in response to existing challenges.

|**2024-09-13**|**AI-LieDar: Examine the Trade-off Between Utility and Truthfulness in LLM Agents**|To be safely and successfully deployed, LLMs must simultaneously satisfy truthfulness and utility goals. Yet, often these two goals compete (e.g., an AI agent assisting a used car salesman selling a car with flaws), partly due to ambiguous or misleading user instructions. We propose AI-LieDar, a framework to study how LLM-based agents navigate scenarios with utility-truthfulness conflicts in a multi-turn interactive setting. We design a set of realistic scenarios where language agents are instructed to achieve goals that are in conflict with being truthful during a multi-turn conversation with simulated human agents. To evaluate the truthfulness at large scale, we develop a truthfulness detector inspired by psychological literature to assess the agents' responses. Our experiment demonstrates that all models are truthful less than 50% of the time, although truthfulness and goal achievement (utility) rates vary across models. We further test the steerability of LLMs towards truthfulness, finding that models follow malicious instructions to deceive, and even truth-steered models can still lie. These findings reveal the complex nature of truthfulness in LLMs and underscore the importance of further research to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of LLMs and AI agents.|Zhe Su et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09013)|null|
|**2024-09-13**|**Contri(e)ve: Context + Retrieve for Scholarly Question Answering**|Scholarly communication is a rapid growing field containing a wealth of knowledge. However, due to its unstructured and document format, it is challenging to extract useful information from them through conventional document retrieval methods. Scholarly knowledge graphs solve this problem, by representing the documents in a semantic network, providing, hidden insights, summaries and ease of accessibility through queries. Naturally, question answering for scholarly graphs expands the accessibility to a wider audience. But some of the knowledge in this domain is still presented as unstructured text, thus requiring a hybrid solution for question answering systems. In this paper, we present a two step solution using open source Large Language Model(LLM): Llama3.1 for Scholarly-QALD dataset. Firstly, we extract the context pertaining to the question from different structured and unstructured data sources: DBLP, SemOpenAlex knowledge graphs and Wikipedia text. Secondly, we implement prompt engineering to improve the information retrieval performance of the LLM. Our approach achieved an F1 score of 40% and also observed some anomalous responses from the LLM, that are discussed in the final part of the paper.|Kanchan Shivashankar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09010)|null|
|**2024-09-13**|**Safeguarding Decentralized Social Media: LLM Agents for Automating Community Rule Compliance**|Ensuring content compliance with community guidelines is crucial for maintaining healthy online social environments. However, traditional human-based compliance checking struggles with scaling due to the increasing volume of user-generated content and a limited number of moderators. Recent advancements in Natural Language Understanding demonstrated by Large Language Models unlock new opportunities for automated content compliance verification. This work evaluates six AI-agents built on Open-LLMs for automated rule compliance checking in Decentralized Social Networks, a challenging environment due to heterogeneous community scopes and rules. Analyzing over 50,000 posts from hundreds of Mastodon servers, we find that AI-agents effectively detect non-compliant content, grasp linguistic subtleties, and adapt to diverse community contexts. Most agents also show high inter-rater reliability and consistency in score justification and suggestions for compliance. Human-based evaluation with domain experts confirmed the agents' reliability and usefulness, rendering them promising tools for semi-automated or human-in-the-loop content moderation systems.|Lucio La Cava et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08963)|null|

LLMs require data for fine-tuning, a crucial step in enhancing their performance. In the context of conversational customer support, the data takes the form of a conversation between a human customer and an agent and can be generated with an AI assistant. In our inquiry, involving 11 users who each completed 8 tasks, resulting in a total of 88 tasks, we found that the presence of hallucinations negatively impacts the quality of data. We also find that, although the cognitive forcing function does not always mitigate the detrimental effects of hallucinations on data quality, the presence of cognitive forcing functions and hallucinations together impacts data quality and influences how users leverage the AI responses presented to them. Our analysis of user behavior reveals distinct patterns of reliance on AI-generated responses, highlighting the importance of managing hallucinations in AI-generated content within conversational AI contexts.|Zahra Ashktorab et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08937)|null|
|**2024-09-13**|**SynSUM -- Synthetic Benchmark with Structured and Unstructured Medical Records**|We present the SynSUM benchmark, a synthetic dataset linking unstructured clinical notes to structured background variables. The dataset consists of 10,000 artificial patient records containing tabular variables (like symptoms, diagnoses and underlying conditions) and related notes describing the fictional patient encounter in the domain of respiratory diseases. The tabular portion of the data is generated through a Bayesian network, where both the causal structure between the variables and the conditional probabilities are proposed by an expert based on domain knowledge. We then prompt a large language model (GPT-4o) to generate a clinical note related to this patient encounter, describing the patient symptoms and additional context. The SynSUM dataset is primarily designed to facilitate research on clinical information extraction in the presence of tabular background variables, which can be linked through domain knowledge to concepts of interest to be extracted from the text - the symptoms, in the case of SynSUM. Secondary uses include research on the automation of clinical reasoning over both tabular data and text, causal effect estimation in the presence of tabular and/or textual confounders, and multi-modal synthetic data generation.

Despite these advancements, effectively understanding the wide spectrum of user search queries continues to pose a significant challenge. An accurate query understanding system that can handle a variety of entities that represent different user intents is essential for delivering an enhanced user experience. We can build such a system by training a natural language understanding (NLU) model; however, obtaining high-quality labeled training data in this specialized domain is a substantial obstacle. Manual annotation is costly and impractical for capturing users' vast vocabulary variations. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) through weak supervision to automatically annotate a vast collection of user search queries. Using prompt engineering and a diverse set of LLM personas, we generate training data that matches human annotator expectations. By incorporating domain knowledge via Chain of Thought and In-Context Learning, our approach leverages the labeled data to train low-latency models optimized for real-time inference. Extensive evaluations demonstrated that our approach outperformed the baseline with an average relative gain of 113% in recall. Furthermore, our novel prompt engineering framework yields higher quality LLM-generated data to be used for weak supervision; we observed 47.60% improvement over baseline in agreement rate between LLM predictions and human annotations with respect to F1 score, weighted according to the distribution of occurrences of the search queries. Our persona selection routing mechanism further adds an additional 3.67% increase in weighted F1 score on top of our novel prompt engineering framework.|Farnoosh Javadi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08931)|null|
|**2024-09-13**|**AnyBipe: An End-to-End Framework for Training and Deploying Bipedal Robots Guided by Large Language Models**|Training and deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies for robots, especially in accomplishing specific tasks, presents substantial challenges. Recent advancements have explored diverse reward function designs, training techniques, simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfers, and performance analysis methodologies, yet these still require significant human intervention. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for training and deploying RL policies, guided by Large Language Models (LLMs), and evaluates its effectiveness on bipedal robots. The framework consists of three interconnected modules: an LLM-guided reward function design module, an RL training module leveraging prior work, and a sim-to-real homomorphic evaluation module. This design significantly reduces the need for human input by utilizing only essential simulation and deployment platforms, with the option to incorporate human-engineered strategies and historical data. We detail the construction of these modules, their advantages over traditional approaches, and demonstrate the framework's capability to autonomously develop and refine controlling strategies for bipedal robot locomotion, showcasing its potential to operate independently of human intervention.|Yifei Yao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08904)|null|
|**2024-09-13**|**A Market for Lemons? Strategic Directions for a Vigilant Application of Artificial Intelligence in Entrepreneurship Research**|The rapid expansion of AI adoption (e.g., using machine learning, deep learning, or large language models as research methods) and the increasing availability of big data have the potential to bring about the most significant transformation in entrepreneurship scholarship the field has ever witnessed. This article makes a pressing meta-contribution by highlighting a significant risk of unproductive knowledge exchanges in entrepreneurship research amid the AI revolution. It offers strategies to mitigate this risk and provides guidance for future AI-based studies to enhance their collective impact and relevance. Drawing on Akerlof's renowned market-for-lemons concept, we identify the potential for significant knowledge asymmetries emerging from the field's evolution into its current landscape (e.g., complexities around construct validity, theory building, and research relevance). Such asymmetries are particularly deeply ingrained due to what we term the double-black-box puzzle, where the widely recognized black box nature of AI methods intersects with the black box nature of the entrepreneurship phenomenon driven by inherent uncertainty. As a result, these asymmetries could lead to an increase in suboptimal research products that go undetected, collectively creating a market for lemons that undermines the field's well-being, reputation, and impact. However, importantly, if these risks can be mitigated, the AI revolution could herald a new golden era for entrepreneurship research. We discuss the necessary actions to elevate the field to a higher level of AI resilience while steadfastly maintaining its foundational principles and core values.|Martin Obschonka et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08890)|null|
|**2024-09-13**|**Visual Language Tracking with Multi-modal Interaction: A Robust Benchmark**|Visual Language Tracking (VLT) enhances tracking by mitigating the limitations of relying solely on the visual modality, utilizing high-level semantic information through language. This integration of the language enables more advanced human-machine interaction. The essence of interaction is cognitive alignment, which typically requires multiple information exchanges, especially in the sequential decision-making process of VLT. However, current VLT benchmarks do not account for multi-round interactions during tracking. They provide only an initial text and bounding box (bbox) in the first frame, with no further interaction as tracking progresses, deviating from the original motivation of the VLT task. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and robust benchmark, VLT-MI (Visual Language Tracking with Multi-modal Interaction), which introduces multi-round interaction into the VLT task for the first time. (1) We generate diverse, multi-granularity texts for multi-round, multi-modal interaction based on existing mainstream VLT benchmarks using DTLLM-VLT, leveraging the world knowledge of LLMs. (2) We propose a new VLT interaction paradigm that achieves multi-round interaction through text updates and object recovery. When multiple tracking failures occur, we provide the tracker with more aligned texts and corrected bboxes through interaction, thereby expanding the scope of VLT downstream tasks. (3) We conduct comparative experiments on both traditional VLT benchmarks and VLT-MI, evaluating and analyzing the accuracy and robustness of trackers under the interactive paradigm. This work offers new insights and paradigms for the VLT task, enabling a fine-grained evaluation of multi-modal trackers. We believe this approach can be extended to additional datasets in the future, supporting broader evaluations and comparisons of video-language model capabilities.|Xuchen Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08887)|null|
|**2024-09-12**|**Windows Agent Arena: Evaluating Multi-Modal OS Agents at Scale**|Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable potential to act as computer agents, enhancing human productivity and software accessibility in multi-modal tasks that require planning and reasoning. However, measuring agent performance in realistic environments remains a challenge since: (i) most benchmarks are limited to specific modalities or domains (e.g. text-only, web navigation, Q&A, coding) and (ii) full benchmark evaluations are slow (on order of magnitude of days) given the multi-step sequential nature of tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the Windows Agent Arena: a reproducible, general environment focusing exclusively on the Windows operating system (OS) where agents can operate freely within a real Windows OS and use the same wide range of applications, tools, and web browsers available to human users when solving tasks. We adapt the OSWorld framework (Xie et al., 2024) to create 150+ diverse Windows tasks across representative domains that require agent abilities in planning, screen understanding, and tool usage. Our benchmark is scalable and can be seamlessly parallelized in Azure for a full benchmark evaluation in as little as 20 minutes. To demonstrate Windows Agent Arena's capabilities, we also introduce a new multi-modal agent, Navi. Our agent achieves a success rate of 19.5% in the Windows domain, compared to 74.5% performance of an unassisted human. Navi also demonstrates strong performance on another popular web-based benchmark, Mind2Web. We offer extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of Navi's performance, and provide insights into the opportunities for future research in agent development and data generation using Windows Agent Arena.

While existing AI-based tools enable querying this data using natural language, they mostly only support retrieving individual pieces of information like certain objects in photos and struggle with answering more complex queries that involve interpreting interconnected memories like event sequences. We conducted a one-month diary study to collect realistic user queries and generated a taxonomy of necessary contextual information for integrating with captured memories. We then introduce OmniQuery, a novel system that is able to answer complex personal memory-related questions that require extracting and inferring contextual information. OmniQuery augments single captured memories through integrating scattered contextual information from multiple interconnected memories, retrieves relevant memories, and uses a large language model (LLM) to comprehensive answers. In human evaluations, we show the effectiveness of OmniQuery with an accuracy of 71.5%, and it outperformed a conventional RAG system, winning or tying in 74.5% of the time.|Jiahao Nick Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08250)|null|

In this paper, we propose Source2Synth: a new method that can be used for teaching LLMs new skills without relying on costly human annotations. Source2Synth takes as input a custom data source and produces synthetic data points with intermediate reasoning steps grounded in real-world sources. Source2Synth improves the dataset quality by discarding low-quality generations based on their answerability. We demonstrate the generality of this approach by applying it to two challenging domains: we test reasoning abilities in multi-hop question answering (MHQA), and tool usage in tabular question answering (TQA). Our method improves performance by 25.51% for TQA on WikiSQL and 22.57% for MHQA on HotPotQA compared to the fine-tuned baselines.|Alisia Lupidi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08239)|null|

Honeypots, which are decoy systems designed to lure and interact with attackers, have emerged as a critical component in cybersecurity. In this paper, we present a novel approach to creating realistic and interactive honeypot systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). By fine-tuning a pre-trained open-source language model on a diverse dataset of attacker-generated commands and responses, we developed a honeypot capable of sophisticated engagement with attackers. Our methodology involved several key steps: data collection and processing, prompt engineering, model selection, and supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model's performance. Evaluation through similarity metrics and live deployment demonstrated that our approach effectively generates accurate and informative responses. The results highlight the potential of LLMs to revolutionize honeypot technology, providing cybersecurity professionals with a powerful tool to detect and analyze malicious activity, thereby enhancing overall security infrastructure.|Hakan T.

|**2024-09-12**|**What Makes a Maze Look Like a Maze?**|A unique aspect of human visual understanding is the ability to flexibly interpret abstract concepts: acquiring lifted rules explaining what they symbolize, grounding them across familiar and unfamiliar contexts, and making predictions or reasoning about them. While off-the-shelf vision-language models excel at making literal interpretations of images (e.g., recognizing object categories such as tree branches), they still struggle to make sense of such visual abstractions (e.g., how an arrangement of tree branches may form the walls of a maze). To address this challenge, we introduce Deep Schema Grounding (DSG), a framework that leverages explicit structured representations of visual abstractions for grounding and reasoning. At the core of DSG are schemas--dependency graph descriptions of abstract concepts that decompose them into more primitive-level symbols. DSG uses large language models to extract schemas, then hierarchically grounds concrete to abstract components of the schema onto images with vision-language models. The grounded schema is used to augment visual abstraction understanding. We systematically evaluate DSG and different methods in reasoning on our new Visual Abstractions Dataset, which consists of diverse, real-world images of abstract concepts and corresponding question-answer pairs labeled by humans. We show that DSG significantly improves the abstract visual reasoning performance of vision-language models, and is a step toward human-aligned understanding of visual abstractions.|Joy Hsu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08202)|null|
|**2024-09-12**|**Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Entity Matching**|Generative large language models (LLMs) are a promising alternative to pre-trained language models for entity matching due to their high zero-shot performance and their ability to generalize to unseen entities. Existing research on using LLMs for entity matching has focused on prompt engineering and in-context learning. This paper explores the potential of fine-tuning LLMs for entity matching. We analyze fine-tuning along two dimensions: 1) The representation of training examples, where we experiment with adding different types of LLM-generated explanations to the training set, and 2) the selection and generation of training examples using LLMs. In addition to the matching performance on the source dataset, we investigate how fine-tuning affects the model's ability to generalize to other in-domain datasets as well as across topical domains. Our experiments show that fine-tuning significantly improves the performance of the smaller models while the results for the larger models are mixed. Fine-tuning also improves the generalization to in-domain datasets while hurting cross-domain transfer. We show that adding structured explanations to the training set has a positive impact on the performance of three out of four LLMs, while the proposed example selection and generation methods only improve the performance of Llama 3.1 8B while decreasing the performance of GPT-4o Mini.|Aaron Steiner et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08185)|**[link](https://github.com/wbsg-uni-mannheim/tailormatch)**|
|**2024-09-12**|**Faster Speech-LLaMA Inference with Multi-token Prediction**|Large language models (LLMs) have become proficient at solving a wide variety of tasks, including those involving multi-modal inputs. In particular, instantiating an LLM (such as LLaMA) with a speech encoder and training it on paired data imparts speech recognition (ASR) abilities to the decoder-only model, hence called Speech-LLaMA. Nevertheless, due to the sequential nature of auto-regressive inference and the relatively large decoder, Speech-LLaMA models require relatively high inference time. In this work, we propose to speed up Speech-LLaMA inference by predicting multiple tokens in the same decoding step. We explore several model architectures that enable this, and investigate their performance using threshold-based and verification-based inference strategies. We also propose a prefix-based beam search decoding method that allows efficient minimum word error rate (MWER) training for such models. We evaluate our models on a variety of public benchmarks, where they reduce the number of decoder calls by ~3.2x while maintaining or improving WER performance.|Desh Raj et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08148)|null|
|**2024-09-12**|**LLM-POTUS Score: A Framework of Analyzing Presidential Debates with Large Language Models**|Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, yet their application to political discourse analysis remains underexplored. This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating presidential debate performances using LLMs, addressing the longstanding challenge of objectively assessing debate outcomes. We propose a framework that analyzes candidates' "Policies, Persona, and Perspective" (3P) and how they resonate with the "Interests, Ideologies, and Identity" (3I) of four key audience groups: voters, businesses, donors, and politicians. Our method employs large language models to generate the LLM-POTUS Score, a quantitative measure of debate performance based on the alignment between 3P and 3I. We apply this framework to analyze transcripts from recent U.S. presidential debates, demonstrating its ability to provide nuanced, multi-dimensional assessments of candidate performances. Our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of different debating strategies and their impact on various audience segments. This study not only offers a new tool for political analysis but also explores the potential and limitations of using LLMs as impartial judges in complex social contexts. In addition, this framework provides individual citizens with an independent tool to evaluate presidential debate performances, which enhances democratic engagement and reduces reliance on potentially biased media interpretations and institutional influence, thereby strengthening the foundation of informed civic participation.|Zhengliang Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08147)|null|

To address the challenge of extensive manual annotation, the study employs a large language model (LLM) for automatic annotation, resulting in the creation of the CLC-UKET dataset. The dataset consists of approximately 19,000 UKET cases and their metadata. Comprehensive legal annotations cover facts, claims, precedent references, statutory references, case outcomes, reasons and jurisdiction codes. Facilitated by the CLC-UKET data, we examine a multi-class case outcome prediction task in the UKET. Human predictions are collected to establish a performance reference for model comparison. Empirical results from baseline models indicate that finetuned transformer models outperform zero-shot and few-shot LLMs on the UKET prediction task. The performance of zero-shot LLMs can be enhanced by integrating task-related information into few-shot examples. We hope that the CLC-UKET dataset, along with human annotations and empirical findings, can serve as a valuable benchmark for employment-related dispute resolution.|Huiyuan Xie et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08098)|null|

This article reviews recent literature addressing key issues in LLM security, with a focus on accuracy, bias, content detection, and vulnerability to attacks. Issues related to inaccurate or misleading outputs from LLMs is discussed, with emphasis on the implementation from fact-checking methodologies to enhance response reliability. Inherent biases within LLMs are critically examined through diverse evaluation techniques, including controlled input studies and red teaming exercises.

The article also probes the complexity of distinguishing LLM-generated content from human-produced text, introducing detection mechanisms like DetectGPT and watermarking techniques while noting the limitations of machine learning enabled classifiers under intricate circumstances. Moreover, LLM vulnerabilities, including jailbreak attacks and prompt injection exploits, are analyzed by looking into different case studies and large-scale competitions like HackAPrompt.

However, it is often too time-consuming for widespread use in educational practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have potential for automating feedback, they struggle with reasoning and interaction in an interactive setting. This paper introduces CAELF, a Contestable AI Empowered LLM Framework for automating interactive feedback. CAELF allows students to query, challenge, and clarify their feedback by integrating a multi-agent system with computational argumentation. Essays are first assessed by multiple Teaching-Assistant Agents (TA Agents), and then a Teacher Agent aggregates the evaluations through formal reasoning to generate feedback and grades. Students can further engage with the feedback to refine their understanding. A case study on 500 critical thinking essays with user studies demonstrates that CAELF significantly improves interactive feedback, enhancing the reasoning and interaction capabilities of LLMs. This approach offers a promising solution to overcoming the time and resource barriers that have limited the adoption of interactive feedback in educational settings.|Shengxin Hong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07453)|null|

Such a capability would be a boon to the research community, helping researchers validate, understand, and extend prior work. To advance towards this goal, we introduce SUPER, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of LLMs in setting up and executing tasks from research repositories. SUPERaims to capture the realistic challenges faced by researchers working with Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) research repositories. Our benchmark comprises three distinct problem sets: 45 end-to-end problems with annotated expert solutions, 152 sub problems derived from the expert set that focus on specific challenges (e.g., configuring a trainer), and 602 automatically generated problems for larger-scale development. We introduce various evaluation measures to assess both task success and progress, utilizing gold solutions when available or approximations otherwise. We show that state-of-the-art approaches struggle to solve these problems with the best model (GPT-4o) solving only 16.3% of the end-to-end set, and 46.1% of the scenarios. This illustrates the challenge of this task, and suggests that SUPER can serve as a valuable resource for the community to make and measure progress.|Ben Bogin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07440)|**[link](https://github.com/allenai/super-benchmark)**|
|**2024-09-11**|**Towards Fairer Health Recommendations: finding informative unbiased samples via Word Sense Disambiguation**|There have been growing concerns around high-stake applications that rely on models trained with biased data, which consequently produce biased predictions, often harming the most vulnerable. In particular, biased medical data could cause health-related applications and recommender systems to create outputs that jeopardize patient care and widen disparities in health outcomes. A recent framework titled Fairness via AI posits that, instead of attempting to correct model biases, researchers must focus on their root causes by using AI to debias data. Inspired by this framework, we tackle bias detection in medical curricula using NLP models, including LLMs, and evaluate them on a gold standard dataset containing 4,105 excerpts annotated by medical experts for bias from a large corpus. We build on previous work by coauthors which augments the set of negative samples with non-annotated text containing social identifier terms. However, some of these terms, especially those related to race and ethnicity, can carry different meanings (e.g., "white matter of spinal cord"). To address this issue, we propose the use of Word Sense Disambiguation models to refine dataset quality by removing irrelevant sentences. We then evaluate fine-tuned variations of BERT models as well as GPT models with zero- and few-shot prompting. We found LLMs, considered SOTA on many NLP tasks, unsuitable for bias detection, while fine-tuned BERT models generally perform well across all evaluated metrics.|Gavin Butts et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07424)|null|
|**2024-09-11**|**CLNX: Bridging Code and Natural Language for C/C++ Vulnerability-Contributing Commits Identification**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in vulnerability identification. As C/C++ comprises half of the Open-Source Software (OSS) vulnerabilities over the past decade and updates in OSS mainly occur through commits, enhancing LLMs' ability to identify C/C++ Vulnerability-Contributing Commits (VCCs) is essential. However, current studies primarily focus on further pre-training LLMs on massive code datasets, which is resource-intensive and poses efficiency challenges. In this paper, we enhance the ability of BERT-based LLMs to identify C/C++ VCCs in a lightweight manner. We propose CodeLinguaNexus (CLNX) as a bridge facilitating communication between C/C++ programs and LLMs. Based on commits, CLNX efficiently converts the source code into a more natural representation while preserving key details. Specifically, CLNX first applies structure-level naturalization to decompose complex programs, followed by token-level naturalization to interpret complex symbols. We evaluate CLNX on public datasets of 25,872 C/C++ functions with their commits. The results show that CLNX significantly enhances the performance of LLMs on identifying C/C++ VCCs. Moreover, CLNX-equipped CodeBERT achieves new state-of-the-art and identifies 38 OSS vulnerabilities in the real world.|Zeqing Qin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07407)|null|
|**2024-09-11**|**AdaCAD: Adaptively Decoding to Balance Conflicts between Contextual and Parametric Knowledge**|Knowledge conflict arises from discrepancies between information in the context of a large language model (LLM) and the knowledge stored in its parameters. This can hurt performance when using standard decoding techniques, which tend to ignore the context. Existing test-time contrastive methods seek to address this by comparing the LLM's output distribution with and without the context and adjust the model according to the contrast between them. However, we find that these methods frequently misjudge the degree of conflict and struggle to handle instances that vary in their amount of conflict, with static methods over-adjusting when conflict is absent. We propose a fine-grained, instance-level approach called AdaCAD, which dynamically infers the weight of adjustment based on the degree of conflict, as measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence between distributions representing contextual and parametric knowledge. Our experiments across four models on six diverse question-answering (QA) datasets and three summarization tasks demonstrate that our training-free adaptive method consistently outperforms other decoding methods on QA, with average accuracy gains of 14.21% (absolute) over a static contrastive baseline, and improves the factuality of summaries by 5.59 (AlignScore). Furthermore, our analysis shows that while decoding with contrastive baselines hurts performance when conflict is absent, AdaCAD mitigates these losses, making it more applicable to real-world datasets in which some examples have conflict and others do not.|Han Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07394)|**[link](https://github.com/hannight/adacad)**|
|**2024-09-11**|**Demo: SGCode: A Flexible Prompt-Optimizing System for Secure Generation of Code**|This paper introduces SGCode, a flexible prompt-optimizing system to generate secure code with large language models (LLMs). SGCode integrates recent prompt-optimization approaches with LLMs in a unified system accessible through front-end and back-end APIs, enabling users to 1) generate secure code, which is free of vulnerabilities, 2) review and share security analysis, and 3) easily switch from one prompt optimization approach to another, while providing insights on model and system performance. We populated SGCode on an AWS server with PromSec, an approach that optimizes prompts by combining an LLM and security tools with a lightweight generative adversarial graph neural network to detect and fix security vulnerabilities in the generated code. Extensive experiments show that SGCode is practical as a public tool to gain insights into the trade-offs between model utility, secure code generation, and system cost. SGCode has only a marginal cost compared with prompting LLMs. SGCode is available at: http://3.131.141.63:8501/.|Khiem Ton et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07368)|null|
|**2024-09-11**|**Think Together and Work Better: Combining Humans' and LLMs' Think-Aloud Outcomes for Effective Text Evaluation**|This study introduces \textbf{InteractEval}, a framework that integrates human expertise and Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Think-Aloud (TA) method to generate attributes for checklist-based text evaluation. By combining human flexibility and reasoning with LLM consistency, InteractEval outperforms traditional non-LLM-based and LLM-based baselines across four distinct dimensions, consisting of Coherence, Fluency, Consistency, and Relevance. The experiment also investigates the effectiveness of the TA method, showing that it promotes divergent thinking in both humans and LLMs, leading to the generation of a wider range of relevant attributes and enhance text evaluation performance. Comparative analysis reveals that humans excel at identifying attributes related to internal quality (Coherence and Fluency), but LLMs perform better at those attributes related to external alignment (Consistency and Relevance). Consequently, leveraging both humans and LLMs together produces the best evaluation outcomes. In other words, this study emphasizes the necessity of effectively combining humans and LLMs in an automated checklist-based text evaluation framework.

However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly jailbreak attacks, which bypass safety protocols and cause the model to generate misleading or harmful responses. This vulnerability stems from both the inherent susceptibilities of LLMs and the expanded attack surface introduced by the visual modality. We propose Sim-CLIP+, a novel defense mechanism that adversarially fine-tunes the CLIP vision encoder by leveraging a Siamese architecture. This approach maximizes cosine similarity between perturbed and clean samples, facilitating resilience against adversarial manipulations. Sim-CLIP+ offers a plug-and-play solution, allowing seamless integration into existing LVLM architectures as a robust vision encoder. Unlike previous defenses, our method requires no structural modifications to the LVLM and incurs minimal computational overhead. Sim-CLIP+ demonstrates effectiveness against both gradient-based adversarial attacks and various jailbreak techniques. We evaluate Sim-CLIP+ against three distinct jailbreak attack strategies and perform clean evaluations using standard downstream datasets, including COCO for image captioning and OKVQA for visual question answering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sim-CLIP+ maintains high clean accuracy while substantially improving robustness against both gradient-based adversarial attacks and jailbreak techniques. Our code and robust vision encoders are available at https://github.com/speedlab-git/Robust-Encoder-against-Jailbreak-attack.git.|Md Zarif Hossain et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07353)|**[link](https://github.com/speedlab-git/robust-encoder-against-jailbreak-attack)**|
|**2024-09-11**|**Learning to Compress Contexts for Efficient Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering**|Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated great zero-shot performance on visual question answering (VQA). However, when it comes to knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA), MLLMs may lack human commonsense or specialized domain knowledge to answer such questions and require obtaining necessary information from external knowledge sources. Previous works like Retrival-Augmented VQA-v2 (RAVQA-v2) focus on utilizing as much input information, such as image-based textual descriptions and retrieved knowledge, as possible to improve performance, but they all overlook the issue that with the number of input tokens increasing, inference efficiency significantly decreases, which contradicts the demands of practical applications. To address this issue, we propose Retrieval-Augmented MLLM with Compressed Contexts (RACC). RACC learns to compress and aggregate retrieved contexts, from which it generates a compact modulation in the form of Key-Value (KV) cache. This modulation is then used to adapt the downstream frozen MLLM, thereby achieving effective and efficient inference. RACC achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of 62.9% on OK-VQA. Moreover, it significantly reduces inference latency by 22.0%-59.7% compared to the prominent RAVQA-v2. Abundant experiments show RACC's broad applicability. It is compatible with various off-the-shelf MLLMs and can also handle different knowledge sources including textual and multimodal documents.|Weixi Weng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07331)|null|
|**2024-09-11**|**MEDIC: Towards a Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Clinical Applications**|The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare applications has spurred calls for holistic evaluation beyond frequently-cited benchmarks like USMLE, to better reflect real-world performance. While real-world assessments are valuable indicators of utility, they often lag behind the pace of LLM evolution, likely rendering findings obsolete upon deployment. This temporal disconnect necessitates a comprehensive upfront evaluation that can guide model selection for specific clinical applications. We introduce MEDIC, a framework assessing LLMs across five critical dimensions of clinical competence: medical reasoning, ethics and bias, data and language understanding, in-context learning, and clinical safety. MEDIC features a novel cross-examination framework quantifying LLM performance across areas like coverage and hallucination detection, without requiring reference outputs. We apply MEDIC to evaluate LLMs on medical question-answering, safety, summarization, note generation, and other tasks. Our results show performance disparities across model sizes, baseline vs medically finetuned models, and have implications on model selection for applications requiring specific model strengths, such as low hallucination or lower cost of inference. MEDIC's multifaceted evaluation reveals these performance trade-offs, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical implementation in healthcare settings, ensuring that the most promising models are identified and adapted for diverse healthcare applications.|Praveen K Kanithi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07314)|null|
|**2024-09-10**|**Geometric-Averaged Preference Optimization for Soft Preference Labels**|Many algorithms for aligning LLMs with human preferences assume that human preferences are binary and deterministic. However, it is reasonable to think that they can vary with different individuals, and thus should be distributional to reflect the fine-grained relationship between the responses. In this work, we introduce the distributional soft preference labels and improve Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a weighted geometric average of the LLM output likelihood in the loss function. In doing so, the scale of learning loss is adjusted based on the soft labels, and the loss with equally preferred responses would be close to zero. This simple modification can be easily applied to any DPO family and helps the models escape from the over-optimization and objective mismatch prior works suffer from. In our experiments, we simulate the soft preference labels with AI feedback from LLMs and demonstrate that geometric averaging consistently improves performance on standard benchmarks for alignment research. In particular, we observe more preferable responses than binary labels and significant improvements with data where modestly-confident labels are in the majority.|Hiroki Furuta et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06691)|null|

This paper addresses the challenges of enhancing the long-context performance, reducing computational complexity, and leveraging pretrained models collectively termed the "impossible triangle." We introduce E2LLM (Encoder Elongated Large Language Models), a novel approach that effectively navigates this paradox. The method involves splitting long contexts into chunks, compressing each into embedding vectors via a pretrained text encoder, and utilizing an adapter to align these representations with a decoder-only LLM. Two training objectives, focusing on reconstruction of the encoder output and long-context instruction fine-tuning, are employed to facilitate the understanding of soft prompts by the LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that E2LLM achieves superior performance in long-context scenarios while balancing efficiency, performance, and compatibility with pretrained models. Our framework thus represents a significant advancement in the field, contributing to effective long-text modeling.|Zihan Liao et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06679)|null|

However, there is still a lack of exploration on how to build speech interaction models based on open-source LLMs. To address this, we propose LLaMA-Omni, a novel model architecture designed for low-latency and high-quality speech interaction with LLMs. LLaMA-Omni integrates a pretrained speech encoder, a speech adaptor, an LLM, and a streaming speech decoder. It eliminates the need for speech transcription, and can simultaneously generate text and speech responses directly from speech instructions with extremely low latency. We build our model based on the latest Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. To align the model with speech interaction scenarios, we construct a dataset named InstructS2S-200K, which includes 200K speech instructions and corresponding speech responses. Experimental results show that compared to previous speech-language models, LLaMA-Omni provides better responses in both content and style, with a response latency as low as 226ms. Additionally, training LLaMA-Omni takes less than 3 days on just 4 GPUs, paving the way for the efficient development of speech-language models in the future.|Qingkai Fang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06666)|**[link](https://github.com/ictnlp/llama-omni)**|

LLMs have the potential to affect traditional forms of democratic engagements, such as voter choice, government surveys, or even online communication with regulators; since bots are capable of producing large quantities of credible text. To investigate the human perception of LLM-generated content, we recruited over 1,000 participants who then tried to differentiate bot from human posts in social media discussion threads. We found that humans perform poorly at identifying the true nature of user posts on social media. We also found patterns in how humans identify LLM-generated text content in social media discourse. Finally, we observed the Uncanny Valley effect in text dialogue in both user perception and identification. This indicates that despite humans being poor at the identification process, they can still sense discomfort when reading LLM-generated content.|Kristina Radivojevic et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06653)|null|
|**2024-09-10**|**Optimal Workload Placement on Multi-Instance GPUs**|There is an urgent and pressing need to optimize usage of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), which have arguably become one of the most expensive and sought after IT resources. To help with this goal, several of the current generation of GPUs support a partitioning feature, called Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) to allow multiple workloads to share a GPU, albeit with some constraints. In this paper we investigate how to optimize the placement of Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI Inferencing workloads on GPUs. We first identify and present several use cases that are encountered in practice that require workloads to be efficiently placed or migrated to other GPUs to make room for incoming workloads. The overarching goal is to use as few GPUs as possible and to further minimize memory and compute wastage on GPUs that are utilized. We have developed two approaches to address this problem: an optimization method and a heuristic method. We benchmark these with two workload scheduling heuristics for multiple use cases. Our results show up to 2.85x improvement in the number of GPUs used and up to 70% reduction in GPU wastage over baseline heuristics. We plan to enable the SRE community to leverage our proposed method in production environments.|Bekir Turkkan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06646)|null|

Existing AudioLLMs typically combine a pre-trained audio encoder with a pre-trained LLM, which are subsequently finetuned on specific audio tasks. However, the pre-trained audio encoder has constrained capacity to capture features for new tasks and datasets. To address this, we propose to incorporate mixtures of `weak' encoders (MoWE) into the AudioLLM framework. MoWE supplements a base encoder with a pool of relatively light weight encoders, selectively activated based on the audio input to enhance feature extraction without significantly increasing model size. Our empirical results demonstrate that MoWE effectively improves multi-task performance, broadening the applicability of AudioLLMs to more diverse audio tasks.|Wenyu Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06635)|null|
|**2024-09-10**|**A Practice of Post-Training on Llama-3 70B with Optimal Selection of Additional Language Mixture Ratio**|Large Language Models (LLM) often needs to be Continual Pre-Trained (CPT) to obtain the unfamiliar language skill or adapt into new domains. The huge training cost of CPT often asks for cautious choice of key hyper-parameters such as the mixture ratio of extra language or domain corpus. However, there is no systematic study which bridge the gap between the optimal mixture ratio and the actual model performance, and the gap between experimental scaling law and the actual deployment in the full model size. In this paper, we perform CPT on Llama-3 8B and 70B to enhance its Chinese ability. We study the optimal correlation between the Additional Language Mixture Ratio (ALMR) and the Learning Rate (LR) on the 8B size which directly indicate the optimal experimental set up. By thorough choice of hyper-parameter, and subsequent fine-tuning, the model capability is improved not only on the Chinese-related benchmark, but also some specific domains including math, coding and emotional intelligence. We deploy the final 70B version of LLM on an real-life chat system which obtain satisfying performance.|Ningyuan Xi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06624)|null|

We exploit curated synthetic data on a large scale -- several Blackbird Language Matrices (BLMs) problems in Italian -- and use them to study how sentence representations built using pre-trained language models encode specific syntactic and semantic information. We use a two-level architecture to model separately a compression of the sentence embeddings into a representation that contains relevant information for a task, and a BLM task. We then investigate whether we can obtain compressed sentence representations that encode syntactic and semantic information relevant to several BLM tasks. While we expected that the sentence structure -- in terms of sequence of phrases/chunks -- and chunk properties could be shared across tasks, performance and error analysis show that the clues for the different tasks are encoded in different manners in the sentence embeddings, suggesting that abstract linguistic notions such as constituents or thematic roles does not seem to be present in the pretrained sentence embeddings.|Vivi Nastase et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06622)|null|

Inspirited by this observation, we proposed a new approach called Skepticism Modeling (SM). This approach is formalized by combining the information of token and logits for self estimation. We construct the doubt emotion aware data, perform continual pre-training, and then fine-tune the LLMs, improve their ability of self estimation. Experimental results demonstrate this new approach effectively enhances a model's ability to estimate their uncertainty, and validate its generalization ability of other tasks by out-of-domain experiments.|Yetao Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06601)|null|
|**2024-09-09**|**MMEvol: Empowering Multimodal Large Language Models with Evol-Instruct**|The development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has seen significant advancements. However, the quantity and quality of multimodal instruction data have emerged as significant bottlenecks in their progress. Manually creating multimodal instruction data is both time-consuming and inefficient, posing challenges in producing instructions of high complexity. Moreover, distilling instruction data from black-box commercial models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4V) often results in simplistic instruction data, which constrains performance to that of these models. The challenge of curating diverse and complex instruction data remains substantial. We propose MMEvol, a novel multimodal instruction data evolution framework that combines fine-grained perception evolution, cognitive reasoning evolution, and interaction evolution. This iterative approach breaks through data quality bottlenecks to generate a complex and diverse image-text instruction dataset, thereby empowering MLLMs with enhanced capabilities. Beginning with an initial set of instructions, SEED-163K, we utilize MMEvol to systematically broadens the diversity of instruction types, integrates reasoning steps to enhance cognitive capabilities, and extracts detailed information from images to improve visual understanding and robustness. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of our data, we train LLaVA-NeXT using the evolved data and conduct experiments across 13 vision-language tasks. Compared to the baseline trained with seed data, our approach achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.1 points and reaches state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on 9 of these tasks.|Run Luo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05840)|null|

This study explores LLMs' ability to tackle diverse programming challenges across platforms with varying difficulty, offering insights into their real-time and offline performance and comparing them with human programmers.   We tested 98 problems from LeetCode, 126 from Codeforces, covering 15 categories. Nine online contests from Codeforces and LeetCode were conducted, along with two certification tests on HackerRank, to assess real-time performance. Prompts and feedback mechanisms were used to guide LLMs, and correlations were explored across different scenarios.   LLMs, like ChatGPT (71.43% success on LeetCode), excelled in LeetCode and HackerRank certifications but struggled in virtual contests, particularly on Codeforces. They performed better than users in LeetCode archives, excelling in time and memory efficiency but underperforming in harder Codeforces contests.

However, progress in understanding pretraining data has been slow due to the costly pretraining runs required for data selection experiments. We present a framework that avoids these costs and selects high-quality pretraining data without any LLM training of our own. Our work is based on a simple observation: LLM losses on many pretraining texts are correlated with downstream benchmark performance, and selecting high-correlation documents is an effective pretraining data selection method. We build a new statistical framework for data selection centered around estimates of perplexity-benchmark correlations and perform data selection using a sample of 90 LLMs taken from the Open LLM Leaderboard on texts from tens of thousands of web domains.

This issue is even more pronounced when LLMs are applied to specific languages and domains. For example, LLMs may generate nonsense information when handling Chinese ancient poetry, proverbs, or idioms, owing to the lack of specific knowledge. To this end, this paper introduces a benchmark for rectifying Chinese knowledge in LLMs via knowledge editing. Specifically, we introduce a new Chinese dataset, CKnowEdit, by collecting seven type of knowledge from various sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, thereby accounting for the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical constructs inherent in the Chinese language. Through the analysis of this dataset, we uncover the challenges faced by current LLMs in mastering Chinese.

Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.|Emily Cheng et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05771)|null|
|**2024-09-09**|**Model Input Verification of Large Scale Simulations**|Reliable simulations are critical for analyzing and understanding complex systems, but their accuracy depends on correct input data. Incorrect inputs such as invalid or out-of-range values, missing data, and format inconsistencies can cause simulation crashes or unnoticed result distortions, ultimately undermining the validity of the conclusions. This paper presents a methodology for verifying the validity of input data in simulations, a process we term model input verification (MIV). We implement this approach in FabGuard, a toolset that uses established data schema and validation tools for the specific needs of simulation modeling. We introduce a formalism for categorizing MIV patterns and offer a streamlined verification pipeline that integrates into existing simulation workflows. FabGuard's applicability is demonstrated across three diverse domains: conflict-driven migration, disaster evacuation, and disease spread models. We also explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating constraint generation and inference. In a case study with a migration simulation, LLMs not only correctly inferred 22 out of 23 developer-defined constraints, but also identified errors in existing constraints and proposed new, valid constraints. Our evaluation demonstrates that MIV is feasible on large datasets, with FabGuard efficiently processing 12,000 input files in 140 seconds and maintaining consistent performance across varying file sizes.|Rumyana Neykova et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05768)|null|

It is a dynamic, interactive, and contextually responsive approach, actively involving a large language model (LLM) from the domain of natural language processing (NLP) in artificial intelligence (AI) to produce multiple statements of potential ideas for different design problems. Integrating such AI models with ideation creates what we refer to as an Active Ideation scenario, which helps foster continuous dialogue-based interaction, context-sensitive conversation, and prolific idea generation. A pilot study was conducted with thirty novice designers to generate ideas for given problems using traditional methods and the new CAI-based interface. The key parameters of fluency, novelty, and variety were used to compare the outcomes qualitatively by a panel of experts. The findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed tool for generating prolific, diverse and novel ideas. The interface was enhanced by incorporating a prompt-engineered structured dialogue style for each ideation stage to make it uniform and more convenient for the designers. The resulting responses of such a structured CAI interface were found to be more succinct and aligned towards the subsequent design stage, namely conceptualization. The paper thus established the rich potential of using Generative AI (Gen-AI) for the early ill-structured phase of the creative product design process.|B.

This work argues that hallucinations in language models are not just occasional errors but an inevitable feature of these systems. We demonstrate that hallucinations stem from the fundamental mathematical and logical structure of LLMs. It is, therefore, impossible to eliminate them through architectural improvements, dataset enhancements, or fact-checking mechanisms. Our analysis draws on computational theory and Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem, which references the undecidability of problems like the Halting, Emptiness, and Acceptance Problems. We demonstrate that every stage of the LLM process-from training data compilation to fact retrieval, intent classification, and text generation-will have a non-zero probability of producing hallucinations. This work introduces the concept of Structural Hallucination as an intrinsic nature of these systems. By establishing the mathematical certainty of hallucinations, we challenge the prevailing notion that they can be fully mitigated.|Sourav Banerjee et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05746)|null|

Often, the user doesn't know how to identify or access the right data source. This problem is compounded even further if multiple (and potentially siloed) data sources must be assembled to derive the answer. Recently, various Text-to-SQL applications that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) have addressed some of these problems by enabling users to ask questions in natural language. However, these applications remain impractical in realistic industrial settings because they fail to cope with the data source heterogeneity that typifies such environments. In this paper, we address heterogeneity by introducing the siwarex platform, which enables seamless natural language access to both databases and APIs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of siwarex, we extend the popular Spider dataset and benchmark by replacing some of its tables by data retrieval APIs. We find that siwarex does a good job of coping with data source heterogeneity.

Adapting generic LLMs for healthcare often requires continual pretraining, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes impractical. Instruction fine-tuning on a specific task may not always guarantee optimal performance due to the lack of broader domain knowledge that the model needs to understand and reason effectively in diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce two multilingual instruction fine-tuning datasets, MMed-IFT and MMed-IFT-MC, containing over 200k high-quality medical samples in six languages. We propose a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage injects general medical knowledge using MMed-IFT, while the second stage fine-tunes task-specific multiple-choice questions with MMed-IFT-MC. Our method achieves competitive results on both English and multilingual benchmarks, striking a balance between computational efficiency and performance.

However, their effectiveness often hinges on the ability to effectively leverage extensive, long user historical data due to its inherent noise and length of such data. Existing pretrained LLMs may generate summaries that are concise but lack the necessary context for downstream tasks, hindering their utility in personalization systems. To address these challenges, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Prediction Feedback (RLPF). RLPF fine-tunes LLMs to generate concise, human-readable user summaries that are optimized for downstream task performance. By maximizing the usefulness of the generated summaries, RLPF effectively distills extensive user history data while preserving essential information for downstream tasks. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in both extrinsic downstream task utility and intrinsic summary quality, surpassing baseline methods by up to 22% on downstream task performance and achieving an up to 84.59% win rate on Factuality, Abstractiveness, and Readability.

|**2024-09-06**|**Question-Answering Dense Video Events**|Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown excellent performance in question-answering of single-event videos. In this paper, we present question-answering dense video events, a novel task that requires answering and grounding the dense-event questions in long videos, thus challenging MLLMs to faithfully comprehend and reason about multiple events occurring over extended time periods. To facilitate the study, we construct DeVE-QA - a dataset featuring 78K questions about 26K events on 10.6K long videos. We then benchmark and show that existing MLLMs excelling at single-event QA struggle to perform well in DeVE-QA. For improvement, we propose DeVi, a novel training-free MLLM approach that highlights a hierarchical captioning module, a temporal event memory module, and a self-consistency checking module to respectively detect, contextualize and memorize, and ground dense-events in long videos for question answering. Extensive experiments show that DeVi is superior at answering dense-event questions and grounding relevant video moments. Compared with existing MLLMs, it achieves a remarkable increase of 4.1 percent and 3.7 percent for G(round)QA accuracy on DeVE-QA and NExT-GQA respectively.|Hangyu Qin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04388)|null|
|**2024-09-06**|**AGR: Age Group fairness Reward for Bias Mitigation in LLMs**|LLMs can exhibit age biases, resulting in unequal treatment of individuals across age groups. While much research has addressed racial and gender biases, age bias remains little explored. The scarcity of instruction-tuning and preference datasets for age bias hampers its detection and measurement, and existing fine-tuning methods seldom address age-related fairness. In this paper, we construct age bias preference datasets and instruction-tuning datasets for RLHF. We introduce ARG, an age fairness reward to reduce differences in the response quality of LLMs across different age groups. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this reward significantly improves response accuracy and reduces performance disparities across age groups.

|**2024-09-06**|**Learning vs Retrieval: The Role of In-Context Examples in Regression with LLMs**|Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of being in-context learners. However, the underlying mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) is still a major research question, and experimental research results about how models exploit ICL are not always consistent. In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating in-context learning mechanisms, which we claim are a combination of retrieving internal knowledge and learning from in-context examples by focusing on regression tasks. First, we show that LLMs can perform regression on real-world datasets and then design experiments to measure the extent to which the LLM retrieves its internal knowledge versus learning from in-context examples. We argue that this process lies on a spectrum between these two extremes. We provide an in-depth analysis of the degrees to which these mechanisms are triggered depending on various factors, such as prior knowledge about the tasks and the type and richness of the information provided by the in-context examples. We employ three LLMs and utilize multiple datasets to corroborate the robustness of our findings. Our results shed light on how to engineer prompts to leverage meta-learning from in-context examples and foster knowledge retrieval depending on the problem being addressed.|Aliakbar Nafar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04318)|null|

This increase of applications and required resources start to become limited by present day hardware technologies. Indeed, novel machine learning subjects such as large language models or high resolution image recognition raise the question of large computing time and energy cost of the required computation. In this context, optical platforms have been designed for several years with the goal of developing more efficient hardware for machine learning. Among different explored platforms, optical free-space propagation offers various advantages: parallelism, low energy cost and computational speed. Here, we present a new design combining the strong and tunable nonlinear properties of a light beam propagating through a hot atomic vapor with an Extreme Learning Machine model. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate the enhancement of the training using such free-space nonlinear propagation on a MNIST image classification task. We point out different experimental hyperparameters that can be further optimized to improve the accuracy of the platform.|Pierre Azam et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04312)|null|
|**2024-09-06**|**Using Large Language Models to Generate Authentic Multi-agent Knowledge Work Datasets**|Current publicly available knowledge work data collections lack diversity, extensive annotations, and contextual information about the users and their documents. These issues hinder objective and comparable data-driven evaluations and optimizations of knowledge work assistance systems. Due to the considerable resources needed to collect such data in real-life settings and the necessity of data censorship, collecting such a dataset appears nearly impossible. For this reason, we propose a configurable, multi-agent knowledge work dataset generator. This system simulates collaborative knowledge work among agents producing Large Language Model-generated documents and accompanying data traces. Additionally, the generator captures all background information, given in its configuration or created during the simulation process, in a knowledge graph. Finally, the resulting dataset can be utilized and shared without privacy or confidentiality concerns.   This paper introduces our approach's design and vision and focuses on generating authentic knowledge work documents using Large Language Models. Our study involving human raters who assessed 53% of the generated and 74% of the real documents as realistic demonstrates the potential of our approach. Furthermore, we analyze the authenticity criteria mentioned in the participants' comments and elaborate on potential improvements for identified common issues.|Desiree Heim et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04286)|null|
|**2024-09-06**|**Advancing Automated Knowledge Transfer in Evolutionary Multitasking via Large Language Models**|Evolutionary Multi-task Optimization (EMTO) is a paradigm that leverages knowledge transfer across simultaneously optimized tasks for enhanced search performance. To facilitate EMTO's performance, various knowledge transfer models have been developed for specific optimization tasks. However, designing these models often requires substantial expert knowledge. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in autonomous programming, aiming to produce effective solvers for specific problems. In this work, a LLM-based optimization paradigm is introduced to establish an autonomous model factory for generating knowledge transfer models, ensuring effective and efficient knowledge transfer across various optimization tasks. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conducted comprehensive empirical studies comparing the knowledge transfer model generated by the LLM with existing state-of-the-art knowledge transfer methods. The results demonstrate that the generated model is able to achieve superior or competitive performance against hand-crafted knowledge transfer models in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness.|Yuxiao Huang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04270)|null|
|**2024-09-09**|**Diagram Formalization Enhanced Multi-Modal Geometry Problem Solver**|Mathematical reasoning remains an ongoing challenge for AI models, especially for geometry problems that require both linguistic and visual signals. As the vision encoders of most MLLMs are trained on natural scenes, they often struggle to understand geometric diagrams, performing no better in geometry problem solving than LLMs that only process text. This limitation is amplified by the lack of effective methods for representing geometric relationships. To address these issues, we introduce the Diagram Formalization Enhanced Geometry Problem Solver (DFE-GPS), a new framework that integrates visual features, geometric formal language, and natural language representations. We propose a novel synthetic data approach and create a large-scale geometric dataset, SynthGeo228K, annotated with both formal and natural language captions, designed to enhance the vision encoder for a better understanding of geometric structures. Our framework improves MLLMs' ability to process geometric diagrams and extends their application to open-ended tasks on the formalgeo7k dataset.|Zeren Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04214)|null|
|**2024-09-06**|**GALLa: Graph Aligned Large Language Models for Improved Source Code Understanding**|Programming languages possess rich semantic information such as data flow that is represented by graphs and not available from the surface form of source code. Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Model. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with four different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 8B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3.|Ziyin Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04183)|null|
|**2024-09-06**|**Combining LLMs and Knowledge Graphs to Reduce Hallucinations in Question Answering**|Advancements in natural language processing have revolutionized the way we can interact with digital information systems, such as databases, making them more accessible. However, challenges persist, especially when accuracy is critical, as in the biomedical domain. A key issue is the hallucination problem, where models generate information unsupported by the underlying data, potentially leading to dangerous misinformation. This paper presents a novel approach designed to bridge this gap by combining Large Language Models (LLM) and Knowledge Graphs (KG) to improve the accuracy and reliability of question-answering systems, on the example of a biomedical KG. Built on the LangChain framework, our method incorporates a query checker that ensures the syntactical and semantic validity of LLM-generated queries, which are then used to extract information from a Knowledge Graph, substantially reducing errors like hallucinations. We evaluated the overall performance using a new benchmark dataset of 50 biomedical questions, testing several LLMs, including GPT-4 Turbo and llama3:70b. Our results indicate that while GPT-4 Turbo outperforms other models in generating accurate queries, open-source models like llama3:70b show promise with appropriate prompt engineering. To make this approach accessible, a user-friendly web-based interface has been developed, allowing users to input natural language queries, view generated and corrected Cypher queries, and verify the resulting paths for accuracy. Overall, this hybrid approach effectively addresses common issues such as data gaps and hallucinations, offering a reliable and intuitive solution for question answering systems.

|**2024-09-05**|**Attention Heads of Large Language Models: A Survey**|Since the advent of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but remain largely as black-box systems. Consequently, their development relies heavily on data-driven approaches, limiting performance enhancement through changes in internal architecture and reasoning pathways. As a result, many researchers have begun exploring the potential internal mechanisms of LLMs, aiming to identify the essence of their reasoning bottlenecks, with most studies focusing on attention heads. Our survey aims to shed light on the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by concentrating on the interpretability and underlying mechanisms of attention heads. We first distill the human thought process into a four-stage framework: Knowledge Recalling, In-Context Identification, Latent Reasoning, and Expression Preparation. Using this framework, we systematically review existing research to identify and categorize the functions of specific attention heads. Furthermore, we summarize the experimental methodologies used to discover these special heads, dividing them into two categories: Modeling-Free methods and Modeling-Required methods. Also, we outline relevant evaluation methods and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current research and propose several potential future directions.

|**2024-09-05**|**LLM-CI: Assessing Contextual Integrity Norms in Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs), while memorizing parts of their training data scraped from the Internet, may also inadvertently encode societal preferences and norms. As these models are integrated into sociotechnical systems, it is crucial that the norms they encode align with societal expectations. These norms could vary across models, hyperparameters, optimization techniques, and datasets. This is especially challenging due to prompt sensitivity $-$ small variations in prompts yield different responses, rendering existing assessment methodologies unreliable. There is a need for a comprehensive framework covering various models, optimization, and datasets, along with a reliable methodology to assess encoded norms.   We present LLM-CI, the first open-sourced framework to assess privacy norms encoded in LLMs. LLM-CI uses a Contextual Integrity-based factorial vignette methodology to assess the encoded norms across different contexts and LLMs. We propose the multi-prompt assessment methodology to address prompt sensitivity by assessing the norms from only the prompts that yield consistent responses across multiple variants. Using LLM-CI and our proposed methodology, we comprehensively evaluate LLMs using IoT and COPPA vignettes datasets from prior work, examining the impact of model properties (e.g., hyperparameters, capacity) and optimization strategies (e.g., alignment, quantization).|Yan Shvartzshnaider et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03735)|null|
|**2024-09-05**|**Safety vs. Performance: How Multi-Objective Learning Reduces Barriers to Market Entry**|Emerging marketplaces for large language models and other large-scale machine learning (ML) models appear to exhibit market concentration, which has raised concerns about whether there are insurmountable barriers to entry in such markets. In this work, we study this issue from both an economic and an algorithmic point of view, focusing on a phenomenon that reduces barriers to entry. Specifically, an incumbent company risks reputational damage unless its model is sufficiently aligned with safety objectives, whereas a new company can more easily avoid reputational damage. To study this issue formally, we define a multi-objective high-dimensional regression framework that captures reputational damage, and we characterize the number of data points that a new company needs to enter the market. Our results demonstrate how multi-objective considerations can fundamentally reduce barriers to entry -- the required number of data points can be significantly smaller than the incumbent company's dataset size. En route to proving these results, we develop scaling laws for high-dimensional linear regression in multi-objective environments, showing that the scaling rate becomes slower when the dataset size is large, which could be of independent interest.|Meena Jagadeesan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03734)|null|
|**2024-09-05**|**Planning In Natural Language Improves LLM Search For Code Generation**|While scaling training compute has led to remarkable improvements in large language models (LLMs), scaling inference compute has not yet yielded analogous gains. We hypothesize that a core missing component is a lack of diverse LLM outputs, leading to inefficient search due to models repeatedly sampling highly similar, yet incorrect generations. We empirically demonstrate that this lack of diversity can be mitigated by searching over candidate plans for solving a problem in natural language. Based on this insight, we propose PLANSEARCH, a novel search algorithm which shows strong results across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and LiveCodeBench (a contamination-free benchmark for competitive coding). PLANSEARCH generates a diverse set of observations about the problem and then uses these observations to construct plans for solving the problem. By searching over plans in natural language rather than directly over code solutions, PLANSEARCH explores a significantly more diverse range of potential solutions compared to baseline search methods. Using PLANSEARCH on top of Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves a state-of-the-art pass@200 of 77.0% on LiveCodeBench, outperforming both the best score achieved without search (pass@1 = 41.4%) and using standard repeated sampling (pass@200 = 60.6%). Finally, we show that, across all models, search algorithms, and benchmarks analyzed, we can accurately predict performance gains due to search as a direct function of the diversity over generated ideas.|Evan Wang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03733)|null|

However, to provide precise and relevant information in response to specific customer queries in industry settings, LLMs require access to a comprehensive knowledge base to avoid hallucinations. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a promising technique to address this challenge. Yet, developing an accurate question-answering framework for real-world applications using RAG entails several challenges: 1) data availability issues, 2) evaluating the quality of generated content, and 3) the costly nature of human evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework that employs LLMs with RAG capabilities for industry use cases. Given a customer query, the proposed system retrieves relevant knowledge documents and leverages them, along with previous chat history, to generate response suggestions for customer service agents in the contact centers of a major retail company. Through comprehensive automated and human evaluations, we show that this solution outperforms the current BERT-based algorithms in accuracy and relevance.

Nowadays, investors can use not only various fundamental information about a startup (e.g., the age of the startup, the number of founders, and the business sector) but also textual description of a startup's innovation and business model, which is widely available through online venture capital (VC) platforms such as Crunchbase. To support the decision-making of investors, we develop a machine learning approach with the aim of locating successful startups on VC platforms. Specifically, we develop, train, and evaluate a tailored, fused large language model to predict startup success. Thereby, we assess to what extent self-descriptions on VC platforms are predictive of startup success. Using 20,172 online profiles from Crunchbase, we find that our fused large language model can predict startup success, with textual self-descriptions being responsible for a significant part of the predictive power.

|**2024-09-05**|**The representation landscape of few-shot learning and fine-tuning in large language models**|In-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) are two common strategies for improving the performance of modern large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks. Despite their different natures, these strategies often lead to comparable performance gains. However, little is known about whether they induce similar representations inside LLMs. We approach this problem by analyzing the probability landscape of their hidden representations in the two cases. More specifically, we compare how LLMs solve the same question-answering task, finding that ICL and SFT create very different internal structures, in both cases undergoing a sharp transition in the middle of the network. In the first half of the network, ICL shapes interpretable representations hierarchically organized according to their semantic content. In contrast, the probability landscape obtained with SFT is fuzzier and semantically mixed. In the second half of the model, the fine-tuned representations develop probability modes that better encode the identity of answers, while the landscape of ICL representations is characterized by less defined peaks. Our approach reveals the diverse computational strategies developed inside LLMs to solve the same task across different conditions, allowing us to make a step towards designing optimal methods to extract information from language models.|Diego Doimo et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03662)|**[link](https://github.com/diegodoimo/geometry_icl_finetuning)**|
|**2024-09-06**|**LLM-based multi-agent poetry generation in non-cooperative environments**|Despite substantial progress of large language models (LLMs) for automatic poetry generation, the generated poetry lacks diversity while the training process differs greatly from human learning. Under the rationale that the learning process of the poetry generation systems should be more human-like and their output more diverse and novel, we introduce a framework based on social learning where we emphasize non-cooperative interactions besides cooperative interactions to encourage diversity. Our experiments are the first attempt at LLM-based multi-agent systems in non-cooperative environments for poetry generation employing both TRAINING-BASED agents (GPT-2) and PROMPTING-BASED agents (GPT-3 and GPT-4). Our evaluation based on 96k generated poems shows that our framework benefits the poetry generation process for TRAINING-BASED agents resulting in 1) a 3.0-3.7 percentage point (pp) increase in diversity and a 5.6-11.3 pp increase in novelty according to distinct and novel n-grams. The generated poetry from TRAINING-BASED agents also exhibits group divergence in terms of lexicons, styles and semantics. PROMPTING-BASED agents in our framework also benefit from non-cooperative environments and a more diverse ensemble of models with non-homogeneous agents has the potential to further enhance diversity, with an increase of 7.0-17.5 pp according to our experiments. However, PROMPTING-BASED agents show a decrease in lexical diversity over time and do not exhibit the group-based divergence intended in the social network. Our paper argues for a paradigm shift in creative tasks such as automatic poetry generation to include social learning processes (via LLM-based agent modeling) similar to human interaction.|Ran Zhang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03659)|**[link](https://github.com/zhangr2021/Multiagent_poetry)**|
|**2024-09-05**|**On the Limited Generalization Capability of the Implicit Reward Model Induced by Direct Preference Optimization**|Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an effective approach for aligning language models to human preferences. Central to RLHF is learning a reward function for scoring human preferences. Two main approaches for learning a reward model are 1) training an EXplicit Reward Model (EXRM) as in RLHF, and 2) using an implicit reward learned from preference data through methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Prior work has shown that the implicit reward model of DPO (denoted as DPORM) can approximate an EXRM in the limit. DPORM's effectiveness directly implies the optimality of the learned policy, and also has practical implication for LLM alignment methods including iterative DPO. However, it is unclear how well DPORM empirically matches the performance of EXRM. This work studies the accuracy at distinguishing preferred and rejected answers for both DPORM and EXRM. Our findings indicate that even though DPORM fits the training dataset comparably, it generalizes less effectively than EXRM, especially when the validation datasets contain distribution shifts. Across five out-of-distribution settings, DPORM has a mean drop in accuracy of 3% and a maximum drop of 7%. These findings highlight that DPORM has limited generalization ability and substantiates the integration of an explicit reward model in iterative DPO approaches.|Yong Lin et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03650)|null|

Inspired by modularity within the human brain, there is a growing tendency to decompose LLMs into numerous functional modules, allowing for inference with part of modules and dynamic assembly of modules to tackle complex tasks, such as mixture-of-experts. To highlight the inherent efficiency and composability of the modular approach, we coin the term brick to represent each functional module, designating the modularized structure as configurable foundation models. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive overview and investigation of the construction, utilization, and limitation of configurable foundation models. We first formalize modules into emergent bricks - functional neuron partitions that emerge during the pre-training phase, and customized bricks - bricks constructed via additional post-training to improve the capabilities and knowledge of LLMs. Based on diverse functional bricks, we further present four brick-oriented operations: retrieval and routing, merging, updating, and growing. These operations allow for dynamic configuration of LLMs based on instructions to handle complex tasks. To verify our perspective, we conduct an empirical analysis on widely-used LLMs. We find that the FFN layers follow modular patterns with functional specialization of neurons and functional neuron partitions. Finally, we highlight several open issues and directions for future research.

To minimize the gap between the historic orthography and contemporary spelling, usually an automatic orthographic normalization of the historical source material is pursued. This report proposes a normalization system for German literary texts from c. 1700-1900, trained on a parallel corpus. The proposed system makes use of a machine learning approach using Transformer language models, combining an encoder-decoder model to normalize individual word types, and a pre-trained causal language model to adjust these normalizations within their context. An extensive evaluation shows that the proposed system provides state-of-the-art accuracy, comparable with a much larger fully end-to-end sentence-based normalization system, fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer large language model. However, the normalization of historical text remains a challenge due to difficulties for models to generalize, and the lack of extensive high-quality parallel data.|Anton Ehrmanntraut et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02841)|null|

Our analysis reveals distinct patterns in predictive sentiments, with Matic demonstrating a notably higher propensity for optimistic predictions. Additionally, we investigate hope and regret sentiments, uncovering nuanced interplay between these emotions and predictive behaviors. Despite encountering limitations related to data volume and resource availability, our study reports valuable discoveries concerning investor behavior and sentiment trends within the cryptocurrency market, informing strategic decision-making and future research endeavors.|Moein Shahiki Tash et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02836)|null|
|**2024-09-04**|**CMM-Math: A Chinese Multimodal Math Dataset To Evaluate and Enhance the Mathematics Reasoning of Large Multimodal Models**|Large language models (LLMs) have obtained promising results in mathematical reasoning, which is a foundational skill for human intelligence. Most previous studies focus on improving and measuring the performance of LLMs based on textual math reasoning datasets (e.g., MATH, GSM8K). Recently, a few researchers have released English multimodal math datasets (e.g., MATHVISTA and MATH-V) to evaluate the effectiveness of large multimodal models (LMMs). In this paper, we release a Chinese multimodal math (CMM-Math) dataset, including benchmark and training parts, to evaluate and enhance the mathematical reasoning of LMMs. CMM-Math contains over 28,000 high-quality samples, featuring a variety of problem types (e.g., multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and so on) with detailed solutions across 12 grade levels from elementary to high school in China. Specifically, the visual context may be present in the questions or opinions, which makes this dataset more challenging. Through comprehensive analysis, we discover that state-of-the-art LMMs on the CMM-Math dataset face challenges, emphasizing the necessity for further improvements in LMM development. We also propose a Multimodal Mathematical LMM (Math-LMM) to handle the problems with mixed input of multiple images and text segments. We train our model using three stages, including foundational pre-training, foundational fine-tuning, and mathematical fine-tuning. The extensive experiments indicate that our model effectively improves math reasoning performance by comparing it with the SOTA LMMs over three multimodal mathematical datasets.|Wentao Liu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02834)|null|
|**2024-09-04**|**ExpLLM: Towards Chain of Thought for Facial Expression Recognition**|Facial expression recognition (FER) is a critical task in multimedia with significant implications across various domains. However, analyzing the causes of facial expressions is essential for accurately recognizing them. Current approaches, such as those based on facial action units (AUs), typically provide AU names and intensities but lack insight into the interactions and relationships between AUs and the overall expression. In this paper, we propose a novel method called ExpLLM, which leverages large language models to generate an accurate chain of thought (CoT) for facial expression recognition. Specifically, we have designed the CoT mechanism from three key perspectives: key observations, overall emotional interpretation, and conclusion. The key observations describe the AU's name, intensity, and associated emotions. The overall emotional interpretation provides an analysis based on multiple AUs and their interactions, identifying the dominant emotions and their relationships. Finally, the conclusion presents the final expression label derived from the preceding analysis. Furthermore, we also introduce the Exp-CoT Engine, designed to construct this expression CoT and generate instruction-description data for training our ExpLLM. Extensive experiments on the RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets demonstrate that ExpLLM outperforms current state-of-the-art FER methods. ExpLLM also surpasses the latest GPT-4o in expression CoT generation, particularly in recognizing micro-expressions where GPT-4o frequently fails.|Xing Lan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02828)|null|
|**2024-09-04**|**Design Contradictions: Help or Hindrance?**|The need for innovative ideas in data visualisation drives us to explore new creative approaches. Combining two or more creative words, particularly those that contradict each other, can positively impact the creative process, sparking novel ideas and designs. As we move towards AI-driven design, an open question arises: do these design contradictions work positively with AI tools? Currently, the answer is no. AI systems, like large language models (LLMs), rely on algorithms that engender similarity, whereas creativity often requires divergence and novelty. This poster initiates a conversation on how to drive AI systems to be more creative and generate new ideas. This research invites us to reconsider traditional design methods and explore new approaches in an AI-driven world. Can we apply the same techniques used in traditional design, like the double diamond model, or do we need new methods for design engineering? How can we quickly design visualisations and craft new ideas with generative AI? This paper seeks to start this critical conversation and offers practical insights into the potential of AI in driving creativity in data visualisation.|Aron E.

|**2024-08-30**|**SYNTHEVAL: Hybrid Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with Synthetic CheckLists**|Traditional benchmarking in NLP typically involves using static held-out test sets. However, this approach often results in an overestimation of performance and lacks the ability to offer comprehensive, interpretable, and dynamic assessments of NLP models. Recently, works like DynaBench (Kiela et al., 2021) and CheckList (Ribeiro et al., 2020) have addressed these limitations through behavioral testing of NLP models with test types generated by a multistep human-annotated pipeline. Unfortunately, manually creating a variety of test types requires much human labor, often at prohibitive cost. In this work, we propose SYNTHEVAL, a hybrid behavioral testing framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a wide range of test types for a comprehensive evaluation of NLP models. SYNTHEVAL first generates sentences via LLMs using controlled generation, and then identifies challenging examples by comparing the predictions made by LLMs with task-specific NLP models. In the last stage, human experts investigate the challenging examples, manually design templates, and identify the types of failures the taskspecific models consistently exhibit. We apply SYNTHEVAL to two classification tasks, sentiment analysis and toxic language detection, and show that our framework is effective in identifying weaknesses of strong models on these tasks.

|**2024-08-30**|**Advancing Multi-talker ASR Performance with Large Language Models**|Recognizing overlapping speech from multiple speakers in conversational scenarios is one of the most challenging problem for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Serialized output training (SOT) is a classic method to address multi-talker ASR, with the idea of concatenating transcriptions from multiple speakers according to the emission times of their speech for training. However, SOT-style transcriptions, derived from concatenating multiple related utterances in a conversation, depend significantly on modeling long contexts. Therefore, compared to traditional methods that primarily emphasize encoder performance in attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) architectures, a novel approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) that leverages the capabilities of pre-trained decoders may be better suited for such complex and challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based SOT approach for multi-talker ASR, leveraging pre-trained speech encoder and LLM, fine-tuning them on multi-talker dataset using appropriate strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional AED-based methods on the simulated dataset LibriMix and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the evaluation set of the real-world dataset AMI, outperforming the AED model trained with 1000 times more supervised data in previous works.|Mohan Shi et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17431)|null|
|**2024-08-30**|**Getting Inspiration for Feature Elicitation: App Store- vs. LLM-based Approach**|Over the past decade, app store (AppStore)-inspired requirements elicitation has proven to be highly beneficial. Developers often explore competitors' apps to gather inspiration for new features. With the advance of Generative AI, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of large language model (LLM)-inspired requirements elicitation. LLMs can assist in this process by providing inspiration for new feature ideas. While both approaches are gaining popularity in practice, there is a lack of insight into their differences. We report on a comparative study between AppStore- and LLM-based approaches for refining features into sub-features. By manually analyzing 1,200 sub-features recommended from both approaches, we identified their benefits, challenges, and key differences. While both approaches recommend highly relevant sub-features with clear descriptions, LLMs seem more powerful particularly concerning novel unseen app scopes. Moreover, some recommended features are imaginary with unclear feasibility, which suggests the importance of a human-analyst in the elicitation loop.|Jialiang Wei et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17404)|null|
|**2024-08-30**|**NDP: Next Distribution Prediction as a More Broad Target**|Large language models (LLMs) trained on next-token prediction (NTP) paradigm have demonstrated powerful capabilities. However, the existing NTP paradigm contains several limitations, particularly related to planned task complications and error propagation during inference. In our work, we extend the critique of NTP, highlighting its limitation also due to training with a narrow objective: the prediction of a sub-optimal one-hot distribution. To support this critique, we conducted a pre-experiment treating the output distribution from powerful LLMs as efficient world data compression. By evaluating the similarity between the $n$-gram distribution and the one-hot distribution with LLMs, we observed that the $n$-gram distributions align more closely with the output distribution of LLMs. Based on this insight, we introduce Next Distribution Prediction (NDP), which uses $n$ -gram distributions to replace the one-hot targets, enhancing learning without extra online training time. We conducted experiments across translation, general task, language transfer, and medical domain adaptation. Compared to NTP, NDP can achieve up to +2.97 COMET improvement in translation tasks, +0.61 average improvement in general tasks, and incredible +10.75 average improvement in the medical domain. This demonstrates the concrete benefits of addressing the target narrowing problem, pointing to a new direction for future work on improving NTP.|Junhao Ruan et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17377)|null|

Employing BERT-based models as a baseline, we compare their efficacy against these transformer-based models. Additionally, we assess the models' self-evaluation capabilities by analyzing the calibration of verbalized confidence scores in these text classification tasks. Our findings reveal that while BERT-based models generally outperform both the LLMs and SLM, the performance of the large generative models is still noteworthy. Furthermore, our calibration analysis reveals that although Gemma is well-calibrated in initial tasks, it thereafter produces inconsistent results; Llama is reasonably calibrated, and GPT consistently exhibits strong calibration. Through this research, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discussion on the utility and effectiveness of generative LMs in addressing some of the planet's most urgent issues, highlighting their strengths and limitations in the context of ecology and CC.|Francesca Grasso et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17362)|**[link](https://github.com/stefanolocci/LLMClassification)**|

Several popular community platforms now offer convenient distribution of a large variety of pre-trained models, allowing anyone to publish without rigorous verification. This scenario creates a privacy threat, as pre-trained models can be intentionally crafted to compromise the privacy of fine-tuning datasets. In this study, we introduce a novel poisoning technique that uses model-unlearning as an attack tool. This approach manipulates a pre-trained language model to increase the leakage of private data during the fine-tuning process. Our method enhances both membership inference and data extraction attacks while preserving model utility. Experimental results across different models, datasets, and fine-tuning setups demonstrate that our attacks significantly surpass baseline performance. This work serves as a cautionary note for users who download pre-trained models from unverified sources, highlighting the potential risks involved.|Md Rafi Ur Rashid et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17354)|null|

Automated process discovery methods often overlook valuable domain knowledge. This knowledge, including insights from domain experts and detailed process documentation, remains largely untapped during process discovery. This paper leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate such knowledge directly into process discovery. We use rules derived from LLMs to guide model construction, ensuring alignment with both domain knowledge and actual process executions. By integrating LLMs, we create a bridge between process knowledge expressed in natural language and the discovery of robust process models, advancing process discovery methodologies significantly. To showcase the usability of our framework, we conducted a case study with the UWV employee insurance agency, demonstrating its practical benefits and effectiveness.|Ali Norouzifar et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17316)|**[link](https://github.com/alinorouzifar/imr-llm)**|

Data-driven predictive methods, especially those utilizing machine learning techniques, have emerged to handle these complexities in urban delivery demand management problems. One particularly pressing problem that has not yet been sufficiently studied is the joint estimation and prediction of city-wide delivery demand. To this end, we formulate this problem as a graph-based spatiotemporal learning task. First, a message-passing neural network model is formalized to capture the interaction between demand patterns of associated regions. Second, by exploiting recent advances in large language models, we extract general geospatial knowledge encodings from the unstructured locational data and integrate them into the demand predictor. Last, to encourage the cross-city transferability of the model, an inductive training scheme is developed in an end-to-end routine. Extensive empirical results on two real-world delivery datasets, including eight cities in China and the US, demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in these challenging tasks.|Tong Nie et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17258)|null|
|**2024-08-30**|**VisionTS: Visual Masked Autoencoders Are Free-Lunch Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters**|Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either fine-tune large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time-series datasets to develop TSF foundation models. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. In this paper, we explore a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich and high-quality natural images, based on the intrinsic similarities between images and time series. To bridge the gap between the two domains, we reformulate the TSF task as an image reconstruction task, which is further processed by a visual masked autoencoder (MAE) self-supervised pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time-series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to existing TSF foundation models. With minimal fine-tuning, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. These findings suggest that visual models could be a free lunch for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-domain research between computer vision and TSF.

Benchmarking Cantonese Capabilities of Large Language Models**|The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the competitive landscape in natural language processing (NLP), particularly for English and other data-rich languages. However, underrepresented languages like Cantonese, spoken by over 85 million people, face significant development gaps, which is particularly concerning given the economic significance of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, and in substantial Cantonese-speaking populations in places like Singapore and North America. Despite its wide use, Cantonese has scant representation in NLP research, especially compared to other languages from similarly developed regions. To bridge these gaps, we outline current Cantonese NLP methods and introduce new benchmarks designed to evaluate LLM performance in factual generation, mathematical logic, complex reasoning, and general knowledge in Cantonese, which aim to advance open-source Cantonese LLM technology. We also propose future research directions and recommended models to enhance Cantonese LLM development.|Jiyue Jiang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16756)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**Reinforcement Learning without Human Feedback for Last Mile Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models**|Reinforcement learning is used to align language models with human preference signals after first pre-training the model to predict the next token of text within a large corpus using likelihood maximization. Before being deployed in a specific domain, models are often further fine-tuned on task specific data. Since human preferences are often unavailable for the last step, it is performed using likelihood maximization as that is the typical default method. However, reinforcement learning has other advantages besides facilitating alignment to a human derived reward function. For one, whereas likelihood maximization is a form of imitation learning in which the model is trained on what to do under ideal conditions, reinforcement learning is not limited to demonstrating actions just for optimally reached states and trains a model what to do under a range of scenarios as it explores the policy space. In addition, it also trains a model what not to do, suppressing competitive but poor actions. This work develops a framework for last-mile fine-tuning using reinforcement learning and tests whether it garners performance gains. The experiments center on abstractive summarization, but the framework is general and broadly applicable. Use of the procedure produced significantly better results than likelihood maximization when comparing raw predictions. For the specific data tested, the gap could be bridged by employing post-processing of the maximum likelihood outputs. Nonetheless, the framework offers a new avenue for model optimization in situations where post-processing may be less straightforward or effective, and it can be extended to include more complex classes of undesirable outputs to penalize and train against, such as hallucinations.|Alec Solway et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16753)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**Assessing Large Language Models for Online Extremism Research: Identification, Explanation, and New Knowledge**|The United States has experienced a significant increase in violent extremism, prompting the need for automated tools to detect and limit the spread of extremist ideology online. This study evaluates the performance of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) in detecting and classifying online domestic extremist posts. We collected social media posts containing "far-right" and "far-left" ideological keywords and manually labeled them as extremist or non-extremist. Extremist posts were further classified into one or more of five contributing elements of extremism based on a working definitional framework. The BERT model's performance was evaluated based on training data size and knowledge transfer between categories. We also compared the performance of GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 models using different prompts: na\"ive, layperson-definition, role-playing, and professional-definition. Results showed that the best performing GPT models outperformed the best performing BERT models, with more detailed prompts generally yielding better results. However, overly complex prompts may impair performance. Different versions of GPT have unique sensitives to what they consider extremist. GPT 3.5 performed better at classifying far-left extremist posts, while GPT 4 performed better at classifying far-right extremist posts. Large language models, represented by GPT models, hold significant potential for online extremism classification tasks, surpassing traditional BERT models in a zero-shot setting. Future research should explore human-computer interactions in optimizing GPT models for extremist detection and classification tasks to develop more efficient (e.g., quicker, less effort) and effective (e.g., fewer errors or mistakes) methods for identifying extremist content.|Beidi Dong et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16749)|null|

The paper advocates for a strictly non-anthropomorphic approach to models while cautiously applying methodologies used in studying human linguistic behavior to the simulated entities. While natural language processing researchers focus on the models themselves, their architecture, evaluation, and methods for improving performance, we as quantitative linguists should strive to build a robust theory concerning the characteristics of texts produced by LLMs, how they differ from human-produced texts, and the properties of simulated entities. Additionally, we should explore the potential of LLMs as an instrument for studying human culture, of which language is an integral part.|Jiří Milička et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16740)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**Smaller, Weaker, Yet Better: Training LLM Reasoners via Compute-Optimal Sampling**|Training on high-quality synthetic data from strong language models (LMs) is a common strategy to improve the reasoning performance of LMs. In this work, we revisit whether this strategy is compute-optimal under a fixed inference budget (e.g., FLOPs). To do so, we investigate the trade-offs between generating synthetic data using a stronger but more expensive (SE) model versus a weaker but cheaper (WC) model. We evaluate the generated data across three key metrics: coverage, diversity, and false positive rate, and show that the data from WC models may have higher coverage and diversity, but also exhibit higher false positive rates. We then finetune LMs on data from SE and WC models in different settings: knowledge distillation, self-improvement, and a novel weak-to-strong improvement setup where a weaker LM teaches reasoning to a stronger LM. Our findings reveal that models finetuned on WC-generated data consistently outperform those trained on SE-generated data across multiple benchmarks and multiple choices of WC and SE models. These results challenge the prevailing practice of relying on SE models for synthetic data generation, suggesting that WC may be the compute-optimal approach for training advanced LM reasoners.|Hritik Bansal et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16737)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**VideoLLM-MoD: Efficient Video-Language Streaming with Mixture-of-Depths Vision Computation**|A well-known dilemma in large vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA) is that while increasing the number of vision tokens generally enhances visual understanding, it also significantly raises memory and computational costs, especially in long-term, dense video frame streaming scenarios. Although learnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed to reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled by LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when addressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce vision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens "skipping layers" rather than decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is inspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous vision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for each transformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion (e.g., 80\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. This approach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately \textasciitilde42\% time and \textasciitilde30\% memory savings for the entire training. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid decreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance compared to the vanilla model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasks in COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets.|Shiwei Wu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16730)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**GradBias: Unveiling Word Influence on Bias in Text-to-Image Generative Models**|Recent progress in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models has enabled high-quality image generation. As performance and accessibility increase, these models are gaining significant attraction and popularity: ensuring their fairness and safety is a priority to prevent the dissemination and perpetuation of biases. However, existing studies in bias detection focus on closed sets of predefined biases (e.g., gender, ethnicity). In this paper, we propose a general framework to identify, quantify, and explain biases in an open set setting, i.e. without requiring a predefined set. This pipeline leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to propose biases starting from a set of captions. Next, these captions are used by the target generative model for generating a set of images. Finally, Vision Question Answering (VQA) is leveraged for bias evaluation. We show two variations of this framework: OpenBias and GradBias. OpenBias detects and quantifies biases, while GradBias determines the contribution of individual prompt words on biases. OpenBias effectively detects both well-known and novel biases related to people, objects, and animals and highly aligns with existing closed-set bias detection methods and human judgment. GradBias shows that neutral words can significantly influence biases and it outperforms several baselines, including state-of-the-art foundation models.

|**2024-08-29**|**Entropic Distribution Matching in Supervised Fine-tuning of LLMs: Less Overfitting and Better Diversity**|Large language models rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to specialize in downstream tasks. Cross Entropy (CE) loss is the de facto choice in SFT, but it often leads to overfitting and limited output diversity due to its aggressive updates to the data distribution. This paper aim to address these issues by introducing the maximum entropy principle, which favors models with flatter distributions that still effectively capture the data. Specifically, we develop a new distribution matching method called GEM, which solves reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization with an entropy regularizer.   For the SFT of Llama-3-8B models, GEM outperforms CE in several aspects. First, when applied to the UltraFeedback dataset to develop general instruction-following abilities, GEM exhibits reduced overfitting, evidenced by lower perplexity and better performance on the IFEval benchmark. Furthermore, GEM enhances output diversity, leading to performance gains of up to 7 points on math reasoning and code generation tasks using best-of-n sampling, even without domain-specific data. Second, when fine-tuning with domain-specific datasets for math reasoning and code generation, GEM also shows less overfitting and improvements of up to 10 points compared with CE.|Ziniu Li et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16673)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**Iterative Graph Alignment**|By compressing diverse narratives, LLMs go beyond memorization, achieving intelligence by capturing generalizable causal relationships. However, they suffer from local 'representation gaps' due to insufficient training data diversity, limiting their real-world utility, especially in tasks requiring strict alignment to rules. Traditional alignment methods relying on heavy human annotations are inefficient and unscalable. Recent self-alignment techniques also fall short, as they often depend on self-selection based prompting and memorization-based learning. To address these issues, we introduce Iterative Graph Alignment (IGA), an annotation-free rule-based alignment algorithm. A teacher model (VLM) employs Iterative Graph Prompting (IGP) to create logical graphs and reference answers. The student model (LLM) identifies local knowledge gaps by attempting to align its responses with these references, collaborating with helper models to generate diverse answers. These aligned responses are then used for iterative supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our evaluations across five rule-based scenarios demonstrate IGP's effectiveness, with a 73.12\% alignment improvement in Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Llama3-8B-Instruct achieving an 86.20\% improvement, outperforming Claude Sonnet 3.5 in rule-based alignment.|Fangyuan Yu et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16667)|null|
|**2024-08-29**|**LLMs generate structurally realistic social networks but overestimate political homophily**|Generating social networks is essential for many applications, such as epidemic modeling and social simulations. Prior approaches either involve deep learning models, which require many observed networks for training, or stylized models, which are limited in their realism and flexibility. In contrast, LLMs offer the potential for zero-shot and flexible network generation. However, two key questions are: (1) are LLM's generated networks realistic, and (2) what are risks of bias, given the importance of demographics in forming social ties? To answer these questions, we develop three prompting methods for network generation and compare the generated networks to real social networks. We find that more realistic networks are generated with "local" methods, where the LLM constructs relations for one persona at a time, compared to "global" methods that construct the entire network at once. We also find that the generated networks match real networks on many characteristics, including density, clustering, community structure, and degree. However, we find that LLMs emphasize political homophily over all other types of homophily and overestimate political homophily relative to real-world measures.|Serina Chang et.al.|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16629)|**[link](https://github.com/snap-stanford/llm-social-network)**|
